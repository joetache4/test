    ms: "CLAUDIUS, GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN enter."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "And can you by no drift of conference"
      - "Get from him why he puts on this confusion,"
      - "Grating so harshly all his days of quiet"
      - "With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?"
    m:
      - "And you can’t put your heads together and figure out why he’s acting so dazed and confused, ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy?"

  - sp: ROSENCRANTZ
    o:
      - "He does confess he feels himself distracted."
      - "But from what cause he will by no means speak."
    m:
      - "He admits he feels confused, but refuses to say why."

  - sp: GUILDENSTERN
    o:
      - "Nor do we find him forward to be sounded."
      - "But with a crafty madness keeps aloof"
      - "When we would bring him on to some confession"
      - "Of his true state."
    m:
      - "And he’s not exactly eager to be interrogated. He’s very sly and dances around our questions when we try to get him to talk about how he feels."

  - sp: GERTRUDE
    o:
      - "  Did he receive you well?"
    m:
      - "Did he treat you well when you saw him?"

  - sp: ROSENCRANTZ
    o:
      - "Most like a gentleman."
    m:
      - "Yes, in a very gentlemanly way."

  - sp: GUILDENSTERN
    o:
      - "But with much forcing of his disposition."
    m:
      - "But it seemed like he had to force himself to be nice to us."

  - sp: ROSENCRANTZ
    o:
      - "Niggard of question, but of our demands"
      - "Most free in his reply."
    m:
      - "He didn’t ask questions, but answered ours at length."

  - sp: GERTRUDE
    o:
      - "    Did you assay him?"
      - "To any pastime?"
    m:
      - "Did you try tempting him with some entertainment?"

  - sp: ROSENCRANTZ
    o:
      - "Madam, it so fell out, that certain players"
      - "We o’erraught on the way. Of these we told him,"
      - "And there did seem in him a kind of joy"
      - "To hear of it. They are about the court,"
      - "And, as I think, they have already order"
      - "This night to play before him."
    m:
      - "Madam, some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here. We told Hamlet about them, and that seemed to do him good. They are here at court now, and I believe they’ve been told to give a performance for him tonight."

  - sp: POLONIUS
    o:
      - "    ’Tis most true,"
      - "And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties"
      - "To hear and see the matter."
    m:
      - "It’s true, and he asked me to beg you both to attend."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "With all my heart, and it doth much content me"
      - "To hear him so inclined."
      - "Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,"
      - "And drive his purpose on to these delights."
    m:
      - "It makes me very happy to hear he’s so interested. Gentlemen, please try to sharpen his interest even more, and let this play do him some good."

  - sp: ROSENCRANTZ
    o:
      - "We shall, my lord."
    m:
      - "We will, my lord."

  - os: "Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN"
    ms: "ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN exit."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,"
      - "For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,"
      - "That he, as ’twere by accident, may here"
      - "Affront Ophelia."
      - "Her father and myself (lawful espials)"
      - "Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,"
      - "We may of their encounter frankly judge,"
      - "And gather by him, as he is behaved,"
      - "If ’t be the affliction of his love or no"
      - "That thus he suffers for."
    m:
      - "Dear Gertrude, please give us a moment alone. We’ve secretly arranged for Hamlet to come here so that he can run into Ophelia. Her father and I, justifiably acting as spies, will hide in the room and observe Hamlet’s behavior, to determine whether it’s love that’s making him suffer."

  - sp: GERTRUDE
    o:
      - "    I shall obey you."
      - "And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish"
      - "That your good beauties be the happy cause"
      - "Of Hamlet’s wildness. So shall I hope your virtues"
      - "Will bring him to his wonted way again,"
      - "To both your honors."
    m:
      - "Yes, I’ll go. As for you, Ophelia, I hope that your beauty is the reason for Hamlet’s insane behavior, just as I hope your virtues will return him to normal some day, for the good of both of you."

  - sp: OPHELIA
    o:
      - "  Madam, I wish it may."
    m:
      - "I hope so too, Madam."

  - os: "Exit GERTRUDE"
    ms: "GERTRUDE exits."

  - sp: POLONIUS
    o:
      - "Ophelia, walk you here. *(to CLAUDIUS)* Gracious, so please you,"
      - "We will bestow ourselves. *(to OPHELIA)* Read on this book"
      - "That show of such an exercise may color"
      - "Your loneliness.—We are oft to blame in this,"
      - "’Tis too much proved, that with devotion’s visage"
      - "And pious action we do sugar o’er"
      - "The devil himself."
    m:
      - "Ophelia, come here.—*(to CLAUDIUS)* Your Majesty, we will hide. *(to OPHELIA)*—Read from this prayer book, so it looks natural that you’re all alone. Come to think of it, this happens all the time—people act devoted to God to mask their bad deeds."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "*(aside)* Oh, ’tis too true!"
      - "How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!"
      - "The harlot’s cheek, beautied with plastering art,"
      - "Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it"
      - "Than is my deed to my most painted word."
      - "O heavy burden!"
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* How right he is! His words whip up my guilty feelings. The whore’s pockmarked cheek made pretty with make-up is just like the ugly actions I’m disguising with fine words. What a terrible guilt I feel!"

  - sp: POLONIUS
    o:
      - "I hear him coming. Let’s withdraw, my lord."
    m:
      - "I hear him coming. Quick, let’s hide, my lord."

  - os: "CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS withdraw"
    ms: "CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS hide."

  - os: "Enter HAMLET"
    ms: "HAMLET enters."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "To be, or not to be? That is the question—"
      - "Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer"
      - "The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,"
      - "Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,"
      - "And, by opposing, end them? To die, to sleep—"
      - "No more—and by a sleep to say we end"
      - "The heartache and the thousand natural shocks"
      - "That flesh is heir to—’tis a consummation"
      - "Devoutly to be wished! To die, to sleep."
      - "To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub,"
      - "For in that sleep of death what dreams may come"
      - "When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,"
      - "Must give us pause. There’s the respect"
      - "That makes calamity of so long life."
      - "For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,"
      - "Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,"
      - "The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,"
      - "The insolence of office, and the spurns"
      - "That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,"
      - "When he himself might his quietus make"
      - "With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,"
      - "To grunt and sweat under a weary life,"
      - "But that the dread of something after death,"
      - "The undiscovered country from whose bourn"
      - "No traveler returns, puzzles the will"
      - "And makes us rather bear those ills we have"
      - "Than fly to others that we know not of?"
      - "Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,"
      - "And thus the native hue of resolution"
      - "Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,"
      - "And enterprises of great pith and moment"
      - "With this regard their currents turn awry,"
      - "And lose the name of action.—Soft you now,"
      - "The fair Ophelia!—Nymph, in thy orisons"
      - "Be all my sins remembered."
    m:
      - "The question is: is it better to be alive or dead? Is it nobler to put up with all the nasty things that luck throws your way, or to fight against all those troubles by simply putting an end to them once and for all? Dying, sleeping—that’s all dying is—a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us—that’s an achievement to wish for. To die, to sleep—to sleep, maybe to dream. Ah, but there’s the catch: in death’s sleep who knows what kind of dreams might come, after we’ve put the noise and commotion of life behind us. That’s certainly something to worry about. That’s the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long. After all, who would put up with all life’s humiliations—the abuse from superiors, the insults of arrogant men, the pangs of unrequited love, the inefficiency of the legal system, the rudeness of people in office, and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad—when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits? Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life, unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death, the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns, which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don’t? Fear of death makes us all cowards, and our natural boldness becomes weak with too much thinking. Actions that should be carried out at once get misdirected, and stop being actions at all. But *shh*, here comes the beautiful Ophelia. Pretty lady, please remember me when you pray."

  - sp: OPHELIA
    o:
      - "Good my lord,"
      - "How does your honor for this many a day?"
    m:
      - "Hello, my lord, how have you been doing lately?"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "I humbly thank you. Well, well, well."
    m:
      - "Very well, thank you. Well, well, well."

  - sp: OPHELIA
    o:
      - "My lord, I have remembrances of yours"
      - "That I have longèd long to redeliver."
      - "I pray you now receive them."
    m:
      - "My lord, I have some mementos of yours that I’ve been meaning to give back to you for a long time now. Please take them."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "No, not I. I never gave you aught."
    m:
      - "No, it wasn’t me. I never gave you anything."

  - sp: OPHELIA
    o:
      - "My honored lord, you know right well you did,"
      - "And with them, words of so sweet breath composed"
      - "As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,"
      - "Take these again, for to the noble mind"
      - "Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind."
      - "There, my lord."
    m:
      - "My lord, you know very well that you did, and wrote letters to go along with them, letters so sweetly written that they made your gifts even more valuable. Their perfume is gone now, so take them back. Nice gifts lose their value when the givers turn out not to be so nice. There, my lord."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Ha, ha, are you honest?"
    m:
      - "Ha ha, are you good?"

  - sp: OPHELIA
    o:
      - "My lord?"
    m:
      - "Excuse me?"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Are you fair?"
    m:
      - "Are you beautiful?"

  - sp: OPHELIA
    o:
      - "What means your lordship?"
    m:
      - "My lord, what are you talking about?"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty."
    m:
      - "I’m just saying that if you’re good and beautiful, your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty."

  - sp: OPHELIA
    o:
      - "Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?"
    m:
      - "But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness?"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once."
    m:
      - "Sure, since beauty’s power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin. This used to be a great puzzle, but now I’ve solved it. I used to love you."

  - sp: OPHELIA
    o:
      - "Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so."
    m:
      - "You certainly made me believe you did, my lord."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "You should not have believed me, for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not."
    m:
      - "You shouldn’t have believed me, since we’re all rotten at the core, no matter how hard we try to be virtuous. I didn’t love you."

  - sp: OPHELIA
    o:
      - "I was the more deceived."
    m:
      - "Then I guess I was misled."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all. Believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where’s your father?"
    m:
      - "Get yourself to a convent at once. Why would you want to give birth to more sinners? I’m fairly good myself, but even so I could accuse myself of such horrible crimes that it would’ve been better if my mother had never given birth to me. and I am arrogant, vengeful, ambitious, with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts, and more than I have time to carry it out in. Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven? Every one of us is a criminal. Don’t believe any of us. Hurry to a convent. Where’s your father?"

  - sp: OPHELIA
    o:
      - "At home, my lord."
    m:
      - "He’s at home, my lord."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool no where but in ’s own house. Farewell."
    m:
      - "Lock him in, so he can play the fool in his own home only. Good-bye."

  - sp: OPHELIA
    o:
      - "O, help him, you sweet heavens!"
    m:
      - "Oh, dear God, please help him!"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry. Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go. Farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool, for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell."
    m:
      - "If you marry, I’ll give you this curse as your wedding present—be as clean as ice, as pure as the driven snow, and you’ll still get a bad reputation. Get yourself to a convent, at once. Good-bye. Or if you have to get married, marry a fool, since wise men know far too well that you’ll cheat on them. Good-bye."

  - sp: OPHELIA
    o:
      - "Heavenly powers, restore him!"
    m:
      - "Dear God, please make him normal again!"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God has given you one face and you make yourselves another. You jig and amble, and you lisp, you nickname God’s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no more on ’t. It hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are married already, all but one, shall live. The rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go."
    m:
      - "I’ve heard all about you women and your cosmetics too. God gives you one face, but you paint another on top of it. You dance and prance and lisp; you call God’s creations by pet names, and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance. Come on, I won’t stand for it anymore. It’s driven me crazy. I hereby declare we will have no more marriage. Whoever is already married (except one person I know) will stay married—all but one person. Everyone else will have to stay single. Get yourself to a convent, fast."

    o:
      - "Oh, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!—"
      - "The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, tongue, sword,"
      - "Th’ expectancy and rose of the fair state,"
      - "The glass of fashion and the mould of form,"
      - "Th’ observed of all observers, quite, quite down!"
      - "And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,"
      - "That sucked the honey of his music vows,"
      - "Now see that noble and most sovereign reason"
      - "Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;"
      - "That unmatched form and feature of blown youth"
      - "Blasted with ecstasy. Oh, woe is me,"
      - "T’ have seen what I have seen, see what I see!"
    m:
      - "Oh, how noble his mind used to be, and how lost he is now! He used to have a gentleman’s grace, a scholar’s wit, and a soldier’s strength. He used to be the jewel of our country, the obvious heir to the throne, the one everyone admired and imitated. And now he has fallen so low! And of all the miserable women who once enjoyed hearing his sweet, seductive words, I am the most miserable. A mind that used to sing so sweetly is now completely out of tune, making harsh sounds instead of fine notes. The unparalleled appearance and nobility he had in the full bloom of his youth has been ruined by madness. O, how miserable I am to see Hamlet now and know what he was before!"

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "Love? His affections do not that way tend."
      - "Nor what he spake, though it lacked form a little,"
      - "Was not like madness. There’s something in his soul"
      - "O’er which his melancholy sits on brood,"
      - "And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose"
      - "Will be some danger—which for to prevent,"
      - "I have in quick determination"
      - "Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England"
      - "For the demand of our neglected tribute."
      - "Haply the seas and countries different"
      - "With variable objects shall expel"
      - "This something-settled matter in his heart,"
      - "Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus"
      - "From fashion of himself. What think you on ’t?"
    m:
      - "Love? His feelings don’t move in that direction. And his words, although they were a little disorganized, weren’t crazy. No, his sadness is hatching something, like a hen does sitting on an egg. What hatches very well may be dangerous. So to prevent any harm being done, I’ve made a quick executive decision: he’ll be sent to England to try to get back the money they owe us. With any luck, the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind. What do you think of this plan?"

  - sp: POLONIUS
    o:
      - "It shall do well. But yet do I believe"
      - "The origin and commencement of his grief"
      - "Sprung from neglected love.—How now, Ophelia?"
      - "You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said."
      - "We heard it all.—My lord, do as you please."
      - "But, if you hold it fit, after the play"
      - "Let his queen mother all alone entreat him"
      - "To show his grief. Let her be round with him,"
      - "And I’ll be placed, so please you, in the ear"
      - "Of all their conference. If she find him not,"
      - "To England send him or confine him where"
      - "Your wisdom best shall think."
    m:
      - "It should work. But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love.—Hello, Ophelia. You don’t have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said. We heard everything.—My lord, do whatever you like, but if you like this idea, let his mother the queen get him alone and beg him to share his feelings with her. I’ll hide and listen in. If she can’t find out what his secret is, then send him off to England or wherever you think best."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "It shall be so."
      - "Madness in great ones must not unwatched go."
    m:
      - "That’s how we’ll do it, then. When important people start to show signs of insanity, you have to watch them closely."
