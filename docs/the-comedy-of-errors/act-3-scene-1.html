<p>Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;</p>

<p>And that tomorrow you will bring it home.</p>
<p>But here’s a villain that would face me down</p>
<p>He met me on the mart, and that I beat him</p>
<p>And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,</p>
<p>And that I did deny my wife and house.—</p>

<p>Signior Angelo, please excuse us. My wife gets angry when I’m late. Here’s the story we’ll tell her: that I was with you at your shop, watching you make her necklace, and that you’re going to deliver it tomorrow. But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him, told him I’d given him a thousand marks in gold, and then lied about my wife and my house. You drunkard, what was that all about?</p>

<p>Be patient, sir! Don’t do this! This will hurt your reputation and make your wife, who’s innocent, look suspicious. Look, you’ve known her a long time. She’s wise, serious, mature, and modest. All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you. Let’s assume that she has a reason, which you don’t know yet: have faith that she’ll eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today. Listen to me. Be patient and leave, and we’ll all go to the Tiger for lunch. In the evening, come back alone and figure out this strange resistance. If you get violent and break in now, in broad daylight, people will talk about it. The common mob will presume things, and your untarnished reputation will be damaged—and that damage will last long after you’re dead. Slander passes from generation to generation, and once it sticks to a family, it’s there forever.</p>

<p>To her will we to dinner. <em>(to ANGELO)</em> Get you home</p>
<p>And fetch the chain; by this I know ’tis made.</p>
<p>Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine,</p>
<p>For there’s the house. That chain will I bestow—</p>
<p>Be it for nothing but to spite my wife—</p>
<p>Upon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste.</p>
<p>Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,</p>
<p>I’ll knock elsewhere, to see if they’ll disdain me.</p>

<p>You’re right—I’ll go quietly. And even though I’m in a distasteful mood, I’ll work on being happy. I know a terrific wench. She’s beautiful and charming—a little wild, but also gentle. We’ll eat at her place. My wife has accused me more than once of misbehaving with this woman. I swear to her that I haven’t, but it doesn’t change anything. We’ll go to her place for lunch. <em>(to ANGELO)</em> Go get the necklace, which I’m sure is done by now. Bring it to the Porcupine, where this woman is. I’ll to give it to her, just to spite my wife. Hurry, good sir. Since my own doors refuse to admit me, I’ll knock somewhere else and see if they turn me away as well.</p>
