<p>I am a feather for each wind that blows:</p>
<p>Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel</p>
<p>And call me father? better burn it now</p>
<p>Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.</p>
<p>It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;</p>
<p>You that have been so tenderly officious</p>
<p>With Lady Margery, your midwife there,</p>
<p>To save this bastard’s life,—for ’tis a bastard,</p>
<p>So sure as this beard’s grey,</p>
<p>—what will you adventure</p>
<p>To save this brat’s life?</p>

<p>I am asked to follow every opinion I hear. Should I allow this bastard to grow up and call me father? I’d rather burn it now than curse it then. But, fine, let it live. <em>(to Anitogonus)</em> You, sir, come here. You have interfered so kindly along with your wench in order to save this bastard’s life—and I’m as certain it’s a bastard as I am that your beard is gray—so what will you risk to save the brat’s life?</p>

<p>Make note of what I tell you, and perform it, because if you fail to do any part of it not only will you die, but so will your crudely outspoken wife, whom I’ll pardon for now. I command you, as my loyal servant, to take this female bastard away to some deserted place far from my kingdom, and to leave it there without mercy, left to its own abilities and the whims of the weather. Since it came to me because of a foreigner, it is only just that I order you, on pain of death and torture, to take it to a foreign place where luck might nurture or kill it. Pick it up.</p>

Sir, be prosperous in more ways than this act deserves! <em>(to the baby)</em> And may a prayer against this cruel act help you, poor thing, condemned to die!</p>

<p>They’ve been gone twenty-three days. Their speedy return predicts that great Apollo wants the truth of this matter revealed. Prepare yourselves, lords.
