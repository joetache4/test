<p>We have scorched the snake, not killed it.</p>

<p>Remains in danger of her former tooth.</p>

<p>Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep</p>
<p>In the affliction of these terrible dreams</p>
<p>That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,</p>
<p>Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,</p>
<p>Than on the torture of the mind to lie</p>
<p>In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave.</p>
<p>After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well.</p>
<p>Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison,</p>
<p>Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing</p>

<b>MACBETH</b>
<p>We have slashed the snake but not killed it. It will heal and be as good as new, and we’ll be threatened by its fangs once again. But the universe can fall apart, and heaven and earth crumble, before I’ll eat my meals in fear and spend my nights tossing and turning with these nightmares I’ve been having. I’d rather be dead than endure this endless mental torture and harrowing sleep deprivation. We killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace. Duncan lies in his grave, through with life’s troubles, and he’s sleeping well. We have already done the worst we can do to him with our treason. After that, nothing can hurt him further—not weapons, poison, rebellion, invasion, or anything else.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what I’ll do, my love, and I hope you’ll do the same. Give Banquo your special attention. Talk to him and look at him in a way that will make him feel important. We’re in a dangerous situation, where we have to flatter him and hide our true feelings.</p>

<p>It’s better you don’t know about it until after it’s done, when you can applaud it. <em>(to the night)</em> Come, night, and blindfold the kindhearted day. Use your bloody and invisible hand to tear up Banquo’s lease on life, which keeps me in fear. <em>(to himself)</em> The sky’s getting dark, and the crow is returning home to the woods. The gentle creatures of the day are falling asleep, while night’s predators are waking up to look for their prey. <em>(to LADY MACBETH)</em> You seem surprised at my words, but don’t question me yet. Bad deeds force you to commit more bad deeds. So please, come with me.</p>
