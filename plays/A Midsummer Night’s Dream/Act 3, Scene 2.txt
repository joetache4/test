  - sp: OBERON
    o:
      - "I wonder if Titania be awaked."
      - "Then, what it was that next came in her eye,"
      - "Which she must dote on in extremity."
    m:
      - "I wonder if Titania is awake yet, and if she is, I wonder what the first thing she saw was. Whatever it is, she must be completely in love with it now."

  - os: "Enter ROBIN"
    ms: "ROBIN enters."

  - o:
      - "Here comes my messenger.—How now, mad spirit?"
      - "What night-rule now about this haunted grove?"
    m:
      - "Ah, here comes my messenger.—What’s going on, you crazy spirit? What havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest?"

  - sp: ROBIN
    o:
      - "My mistress with a monster is in love."
      - "Near to her close and consecrated bower,"
      - "While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,"
      - "A crew of patches, rude mechanicals"
      - "That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,"
      - "Were met together to rehearse a play"
      - "Intended for great Theseus’ nuptial day."
      - "The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,"
      - "Who Pyramus presented in their sport,"
      - "Forsook his scene and entered in a brake,"
      - "When I did him at this advantage take,"
      - "An ass’ nole I fixèd on his head."
      - "Anon his Thisbe must be answerèd,"
      - "And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,"
      - "As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,"
      - "Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,"
      - "Rising and cawing at the gun’s report,"
      - "Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky—"
      - "So at his sight away his fellows fly;"
      - "And, at our stamp, here o’er and o’er one falls."
      - "He “Murder!” cries and help from Athens calls."
      - "Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,"
      - "Made senseless things begin to do them wrong."
      - "For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch,"
      - "Some sleeves, some hats—from yielders all things catch."
      - "I led them on in this distracted fear"
      - "And left sweet Pyramus translated there."
      - "When in that moment so it came to pass,"
      - "Titania waked and straightway loved an ass."
    m:
      - "My mistress Titania is in love with a monster. While she was sleeping in her bed of flowers, a group of bumbling idiots, rough workmen from Athens, got together nearby to rehearse some play they plan to perform on Theseus’ wedding day. The stupidest one, who played Pyramus in their play, finished his scene and went to sit in the bushes to wait for his next cue. I took that opportunity to stick a donkey’s head on him. When it was time for him to go back onstage and talk to his Thisbe, he came out of the bushes and everyone saw him. His friends ran away as fast as ducks scatter when they hear a hunter’s gunshot. One of them was so frightened when he heard my footsteps that he yelled, “Murder!” and called for help from Athens. They were all so afraid that they completely lost their common sense. They started to become scared of inanimate objects, terrified by the thorns and briars that catch at their clothing and pull off their sleeves and hats. I led them on in this frightened, distracted state, and left sweet Pyramus there, transformed into someone with a donkey’s head. At that exact moment, Titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him, an ass."

  - sp: OBERON
    o:
      - "This falls out better than I could devise."
      - "But hast thou yet latched the Athenian’s eyes"
      - "With the love juice, as I did bid thee do?"
    m:
      - "This is going even better than I planned. But have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that Athenian, as I asked you to do?"

  - sp: ROBIN
    o:
      - "I took him sleeping—that is finished too—"
      - "And the Athenian woman by his side,"
      - "That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed."
    m:
      - "Yes, I found him when he was asleep—so that’s taken care of too—and the Athenian woman was sleeping near him. When he woke up, he must have seen her."

  - os: "Enter DEMETRIUS and HERMIA"
    ms: "DEMETRIUS and HERMIA enter."

  - sp: OBERON
    o:
      - "*(aside to ROBIN)* Stand close. This is the same Athenian."
    m:
      - "*(speaking so that only ROBIN can hear)* Step aside. Here’s the Athenian coming now."

  - sp: ROBIN
    o:
      - "*(aside to OBERON)* This is the woman, but not this the man."
    m:
      - "*(speaking so that only OBERON can hear)* That’s definitely the woman I saw, but it’s not the same man."

  - sp: DEMETRIUS
    o:
      - "Oh, why rebuke you him that loves you so?"
      - "Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe."
    m:
      - "Why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much? Save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy."

  - sp: HERMIA
    o:
      - "Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse."
      - "For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse."
      - "If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,"
      - "Being o’er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,"
      - "And kill me too."
      - "The sun was not so true unto the day"
      - "As he to me. Would he have stolen away"
      - "From sleeping Hermia? I’ll believe as soon"
      - "This whole Earth may be bored, and that the moon"
      - "May through the center creep and so displease"
      - "Her brother’s noontide with th’ Antipodes."
      - "It cannot be but thou hast murdered him."
      - "So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim."
    m:
      - "I’m only scolding you now, but I should treat you much worse, because I’m afraid you’ve given me good reason to curse you. If you killed Lysander while he was sleeping, then you’re already up to your ankles in blood. You might as well jump right into a bloodbath and kill me, too. He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime. Would he have snuck away from me while I was asleep? I’ll believe that when I believe that there’s a hole through the center of the earth, and the moon has passed all the way through to the other side. The only possibility is that you’ve murdered him. A murderer should look like you do, so pale and grim."

  - sp: DEMETRIUS
    o:
      - "So should the murdered look, and so should I,"
      - "Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty."
      - "Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,"
      - "As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere."
    m:
      - "That’s how someone who’s been murdered should look, and that’s how I look. You’ve pierced me through the heart with your cruelty, and yet you, the murderer, look as bright and clear as a star in the sky."

  - sp: HERMIA
    o:
      - "What’s this to my Lysander? Where is he?"
      - "Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?"
    m:
      - "What does that have to do with my Lysander? Where is he? Oh, good Demetrius, will you find him for me?"

  - sp: DEMETRIUS
    o:
      - "I had rather give his carcass to my hounds."
    m:
      - "I would rather feed his corpse to my dogs."

  - sp: HERMIA
    o:
      - "Out, dog! Out, cur! Thou drivest me past the bounds"
      - "Of maiden’s patience. Hast thou slain him then?"
      - "Henceforth be never numbered among men!"
      - "Oh, once tell true, tell true even for my sake—"
      - "Durst thou have looked upon him being awake,"
      - "And hast thou killed him sleeping? O brave touch!"
      - "Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?"
      - "An adder did it, for with doubler tongue"
      - "Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung."
    m:
      - "Get out, dog! You’ve driven me to my wit’s end. Did you kill him, then? From now on I won’t even consider you a human being. Oh, just tell the truth for once. tell the truth, if only for my sake.—Would you have even dared to look at him when he was awake? And did you kill him while he was sleeping? Oh, how brave of you! A snake could do that as easily as you could. A snake did do it, because no snake ever had a more forked, lying tongue than you have."

  - sp: DEMETRIUS
    o:
      - "You spend your passion on a misprised mood."
      - "I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood."
      - "Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell."
    m:
      - "You’re getting all worked up over a misunderstanding. I didn’t kill Lysander. ?As far as I know, he’s not even dead."

  - sp: HERMIA
    o:
      - "I pray thee, tell me then that he is well."
    m:
      - "Then please tell me he’s all right."

  - sp: DEMETRIUS
    o:
      - "An if I could, what should I get therefore?"
    m:
      - "If I told you that, what would I get out of it?"

  - sp: HERMIA
    o:
      - "A privilege never to see me more."
      - "And from thy hated presence part I so."
      - "See me no more, whether he be dead or no."
    m:
      - "The privilege of never seeing me again. And now I’m going to leave your despised company. You’ll never see me again, whether or not he’s dead."

  - os: "Exit HERMIA"
    ms: "HERMIA exits."

  - sp: DEMETRIUS
    o:
      - "There is no following her in this fierce vein."
      - "Here therefore for a while I will remain."
      - "So sorrow’s heaviness doth heavier grow"
      - "For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe,"
      - "Which now in some slight measure it will pay,"
      - "If for his tender here I make some stay."
      - "*(lies down and sleeps)*"
    m:
      - "I can’t go after her when she’s in a rage like this. So I’ll stay here for a while. Sadness gets worse when you haven’t had enough sleep. I’ll try to sleep a little here. *(DEMETRIUS lies down and falls asleep)*"

  - sp: OBERON
    o:
      - "*(to ROBIN)* What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite,"
      - "And laid the love juice on some true love’s sight."
      - "Of thy misprision must perforce ensue"
      - "Some true love turned, and not a false turned true."
    m:
      - "*(to ROBIN)* What have you done? You’ve made a mistake and put the love-juice on someone else, someone who was truly in love. Because of your mistake someone’s true love must have turned bad, instead of this man’s false love being turned into a true love."

  - sp: ROBIN
    o:
      - "Then fate o’errules that, one man holding troth,"
      - "A million fail, confounding oath on oath."
    m:
      - "In that case, it must be fate. That’s the way of the world. For every man who’s faithful to his true love, a million end up running after a different lover."

  - sp: OBERON
    o:
      - "About the wood go swifter than the wind,"
      - "And Helena of Athens look thou find—"
      - "All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,"
      - "With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear."
      - "By some illusion see thou bring her here."
      - "I’ll charm his eyes against she do appear."
    m:
      - "Go around the forest, moving faster than the wind, and make sure you find Helena of Athens.—She’s lovesick, and her face is pale from all the sighing she’s been doing, because sighing is bad for the blood. Bring her here with some trick or illusion, and I’ll put the charm on his eyes for when she comes."

  - sp: ROBIN
    o:
      - "I go, I go. Look how I go,"
      - "Swifter than arrow from the Tartar’s bow."
    m:
      - "I go, I go, look at me go—faster than an arrow from a Tartar’s bow."

  - os: "Exit ROBIN"
    ms: "ROBIN exits"

  - sp: OBERON
    o:
      - "*(squeezing flower juice into DEMETRIUS’ eyes)*"
      - "Flower of this purple dye,"
      - "Hit with Cupid’s archery,"
      - "Sink in apple of his eye."
      - "When his love he doth espy,"
      - "Let her shine as gloriously"
      - "As the Venus of the sky."
      - "When thou wakest, if she be by,"
      - "Beg of her for remedy."
    m:
      - "*(putting flower juice on DEMETRIUS’ eyelids)*"
      - "You purple flower, hit by Cupid’s arrow, sink into the pupils of this man’s eyes. When he sees the girl he should love, make her seem as bright to him as the evening star. Young man, when you wake up, if she’s nearby, beg her to cure your lovesickness."

  - os: "Enter ROBIN"
    ms: "ROBIN enters."

  - sp: ROBIN
    o:
      - "Captain of our fairy band,"
      - "Helena is here at hand,"
      - "And the youth, mistook by me,"
      - "Pleading for a lover’s fee."
      - "Shall we their fond pageant see?"
      - "Lord, what fools these mortals be!"
    m:
      - "Helena is nearby, boss. The young man who I mistook for this one is there too, begging her to love him. Should we watch this ridiculous scene? Lord, what fools these mortals are!"

  - sp: OBERON
    o:
      - "Stand aside. The noise they make"
      - "Will cause Demetrius to awake."
    m:
      - "Step aside. The noise they’re making will wake up Demetrius."

  - sp: ROBIN
    o:
      - "Then will two at once woo one."
      - "That must needs be sport alone."
      - "And those things do best please me"
      - "That befall preposterously."
    m:
      - "Then the two of them will both pursue one girl. That will be funny enough, and preposterous situations are my favorite thing."

  - os: "Enter LYSANDER and HELENA"
    ms: "LYSANDER and HELENA enter."

  - sp: LYSANDER
    o:
      - "Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?"
      - "Scorn and derision never come in tears."
      - "Look, when I vow, I weep. And vows so born,"
      - "In their nativity all truth appears."
      - "How can these things in me seem scorn to you,"
      - "Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true?"
    m:
      - "Why do you think I’m making fun of you when I tell you I love you? People don’t cry when they’re mocking someone. Look, when I swear that I love you, I cry, and when someone cries while he’s making a promise, he’s usually telling the truth. How can it seem like I’m making fun of you, when my tears prove that I’m sincere?"

  - sp: HELENA
    o:
      - "You do advance your cunning more and more."
      - "When truth kills truth, O devilish holy fray!"
      - "These vows are Hermia’s. Will you give her o’er?"
      - "Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh."
      - "Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,"
      - "Will even weigh, and both as light as tales."
    m:
      - "You get trickier and trickier. You’ve made the same promises to me and to Hermia—they can’t both be true! They must both be false. The promises you’re making to me belong to Hermia. Will you abandon her? If you weighed the promises you made to me against the promises you made to her, they’d come out the same—they both weigh nothing. They’re lies."

  - sp: LYSANDER
    o:
      - "I had no judgment when to her I swore."
    m:
      - "I wasn’t thinking clearly when I made those promises to her."

  - sp: HELENA
    o:
      - "Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o’er."
    m:
      - "And I don’t believe you’re thinking clearly now, as you break those promises."

  - sp: LYSANDER
    o:
      - "Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you."
    m:
      - "Demetrius loves her, and he doesn’t love you."

  - sp: DEMETRIUS
    o:
      - "*(waking)* O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!"
      - "To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?"
      - "Crystal is muddy. Oh, how ripe in show"
      - "Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!"
      - "That pure congealèd white, high Taurus’ snow,"
      - "Fanned with the eastern wind, turns to a crow"
      - "When thou hold’st up thy hand. Oh, let me kiss"
      - "This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!"
    m:
      - "*(waking up)* Oh Helena, you goddess, you divine and perfect nymph! What can I compare your eyes to? Crystal isn’t as clear as they are. Oh, your lips are as ripe as a pair of tempting cherries touching each other! The pure white of the snow on a mountaintop seems black as a crow’s wing next to the whiteness of your hands. Oh, let me kiss your beautiful white hand. It’ll make me so happy!"

  - sp: HELENA
    o:
      - "O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent"
      - "To set against me for your merriment."
      - "If you were civil and knew courtesy,"
      - "You would not do me thus much injury."
      - "Can you not hate me, as I know you do,"
      - "But you must join in souls to mock me too?"
      - "If you were men, as men you are in show,"
      - "You would not use a gentle lady so"
      - "To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,"
      - "When I am sure you hate me with your hearts."
      - "You both are rivals, and love Hermia,"
      - "And now both rivals to mock Helena—"
      - "A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,"
      - "To conjure tears up in a poor maid’s eyes"
      - "With your derision! None of noble sort"
      - "Would so offend a virgin, and extort"
      - "A poor soul’s patience, all to make you sport."
    m:
      - "Damn it! I see you’re all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs. If you had any manners at all, you wouldn’t treat me like this. Can’t you just hate me, as I know you do? Do you have to get together to humiliate me too? If you were real men, as you pretend to be, you wouldn’t treat a lady this way, making vows and promises and praising my beauty when I know you’re really both disgusted by me. You’re competing for Hermia’s love, and now you’re competing to see which one of you can make fun of me the most. That’s a great idea, a really manly thing to do—making a poor girl cry! No respectable person would offend an innocent girl just to have some fun."

  - sp: LYSANDER
    o:
      - "You are unkind, Demetrius. Be not so."
      - "For you love Hermia. This you know I know."
      - "And here, with all good will, with all my heart,"
      - "In Hermia’s love I yield you up my part."
      - "And yours of Helena to me bequeath,"
      - "Whom I do love and will do till my death."
    m:
      - "Don’t be cruel, Demetrius. I know you love Hermia, and you know I know it. Right here, right now, I swear I’m giving up all my claims on her and handing her to you. In exchange, give up your claim to love Helena, since I love her and will love her until I die."

  - sp: HELENA
    o:
      - "Never did mockers waste more idle breath."
    m:
      - "Nobody’s ever gone to so much trouble just to make fun of someone."

  - sp: DEMETRIUS
    o:
      - "Lysander, keep thy Hermia. I will none."
      - "If e’er I loved her, all that love is gone."
      - "My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourned,"
      - "And now to Helen is it home returned,"
      - "There to remain."
    m:
      - "Lysander, keep your Hermia. I don’t want her. If I ever loved her, all that love is gone now. My love for her was temporary. Now I’ll love Helena forever."

  - sp: LYSANDER
    o:
      - "Helen, it is not so."
    m:
      - "Helena, it’s not true."

  - sp: DEMETRIUS
    o:
      - "Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,"
      - "Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear."
      - "Look, where thy love comes. Yonder is thy dear."
    m:
      - "Don’t insult a deep love that you don’t understand, or you’ll pay the price. Look, here comes the woman you love."

  - sp: HERMIA
    o:
      - "Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,"
      - "The ear more quick of apprehension makes."
      - "Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,"
      - "It pays the hearing double recompense."
      - "Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found."
      - "Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound"
      - "But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?"
    m:
      - "It’s hard to see clearly in the dark of night, but it’s easier to hear well. I couldn’t see you, Lysander, but I heard your voice, and that’s how I found you. Why did you leave me alone so unkindly?"

  - sp: LYSANDER
    o:
      - "Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?"
    m:
      - "Why stay when love tells you to go?"

  - sp: HERMIA
    o:
      - "What love could press Lysander from my side?"
    m:
      - "But what love could make my Lysander leave me?"

  - sp: LYSANDER
    o:
      - "Lysander’s love, that would not let him bide,"
      - "Fair Helena, who more engilds the night"
      - "Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light."
      - "Why seek’st thou me? Could not this make thee know"
      - "The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?"
    m:
      - "I had to hurry to my love, beautiful Helena, who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars. Why are you looking for me? Didn’t you figure out that I left you because I hate you?"

  - sp: HERMIA
    o:
      - "You speak not as you think. It cannot be."
    m:
      - "You can’t mean what you’re saying. It’s impossible."

  - sp: HELENA
    o:
      - "Lo, she is one of this confederacy!"
      - "Now I perceive they have conjoined all three"
      - "To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.—"
      - "Injurious Hermia! Most ungrateful maid!"
      - "Have you conspired, have you with these contrived"
      - "To bait me with this foul derision?"
      - "Is all the counsel that we two have shared,"
      - "The sisters’ vows, the hours that we have spent"
      - "When we have chid the hasty-footed time"
      - "For parting us—oh, is it all forgot?"
      - "All schooldays’ friendship, childhood innocence?"
      - "We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,"
      - "Have with our needles created both one flower,"
      - "Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,"
      - "Both warbling of one song, both in one key,"
      - "As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds,"
      - "Had been incorporate. So we grew together,"
      - "Like to a double cherry—seeming parted"
      - "But yet an union in partition—"
      - "Two lovely berries molded on one stem;"
      - "So, with two seeming bodies but one heart,"
      - "Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,"
      - "Due but to one and crownèd with one crest."
      - "And will you rent our ancient love asunder"
      - "To join with men in scorning your poor friend?"
      - "It is not friendly, ’tis not maidenly."
      - "Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,"

Hurtful Hermia, you ungrateful girl, have you conspired with these two to provoke me with this horrible teasing? Have you forgotten all the talks we’ve had together, the vows we made to be like sisters to one another, all the hours we spent together, wishing that we never had to say goodbye—have you forgotten? Our friendship in our schooldays, our childhood innocence? We used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles, sewing it on one piece of cloth, sitting on the same cushion, singing one song in the same key, as if our hands, our sides, our voices and our minds were stuck together. We grew together like twin cherries—which seemed to be separate but were also together—two lovely cherries on one stem. We seemed to have two separate bodies, but we had one heart. Do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend? It’s not friendly, and it’s not ladylike. All women would be angry with you for doing it, even though I’m the only one who’s hurt by it."

Why does he talk like that to a girl he can’t stand? And why does Lysander deny that he loves you, when he loves you so deeply? Why would he show me any affection, unless you told him to? Why does it matter that I’m not as lucky or lovable as you are and that the love I feel is unrequited? You should pity me for that reason, not hate me."

That way you’ll get them away from each other until they’re so exhausted that they’ll sleep like the dead. *(OBERON gives a new flower to ROBIN)* When they’re asleep, crush some of this flower’s juice into Lysander’s eyes. The flower’s juice has the power to erase all the damage that’s been done to his eyes, and to make him see normally, the way he used to. When they wake up, all this trouble and conflict will seem like a dream or a meaningless vision. Then the lovers will go back to Athens, united together until death. While you’re busy with that, I’ll go see Queen Titania and ask her once again for the Indian boy. And then I’ll undo the spell that I cast over her, so she won’t be in love with that monster anymore.
