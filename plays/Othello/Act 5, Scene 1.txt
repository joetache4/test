  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Here, stand behind this bulk, straight will he come."
      - "Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home."
      - "Quick, quick! Fear nothing. I’ll be at thy elbow."
      - "It makes us, or it mars us. Think on that,"
      - "And fix most firm thy resolution."
    m:
      - "Here, stand behind this wall; he’ll come right away. Keep your sword out, and then stick it in as far as it’ll go. Quick, quick. Don’t be afraid. I’ll be right next to you. This will either make us or break us. Keep that in mind, and be steady."

  - sp: RODERIGO
    o:
      - "Be near at hand, I may miscarry in ’t."
    m:
      - "Stay right near me. I may mess it up."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Here, at thy hand. Be bold, and take thy stand."
    m:
      - "I’m right behind you. Be bold, and get ready."

  - os: "Withdraws"
    ms: "IAGO moves aside."

  - sp: RODERIGO
    o:
      - "I have no great devotion to the deed"
      - "And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons."
      - "’Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies."
    m:
      - "I don’t really want to do this, but he’s given me good reasons. I guess it’s only one man—no big deal. My sword comes out, and he dies."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "*(aside)* I have rubbed this young quat almost to the sense,"
      - "And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio"
      - "Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,"
      - "Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,"
      - "He calls me to a restitution large"
      - "Of gold and jewels that I bobbed from him"
      - "As gifts to Desdemona."
      - "It must not be. If Cassio do remain"
      - "He hath a daily beauty in his life"
      - "That makes me ugly. And besides, the Moor"
      - "May unfold me to him—there stand I in much peril."
      - "No, he must die. But so, I hear him coming."
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* I’ve rubbed this young pimple until he’s ready to pop, and now he’s angry. Whether he kills Cassio, or Cassio kills him, or they kill each other, it all works in my favor. If Roderigo survives, though, he’ll ask me for all the gold and jewelry that I stole from him and said I gave to Desdemona. I can’t let that happen. If Cassio survives,he’s so handsome and well-spoken that he makes me look ugly. And besides, the Moor might tell him about my lies about him.—That would be very dangerous for me. No, he’s got to die. Let it be so. I hear him coming."

      - "But that my coat is better than thou know’st"
      - "I will make proof of thine."
    m:
      - "That thrust might really have hurt me if I didn’t have this armor on under my cloak. Now let’s see what you’ve got on."

    o:
      - "’Tis he. Oh, brave Iago, honest and just,"
      - "That hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong!"
      - "Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,"
      - "And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come."
      - "For, of my heart, those charms, thine eyes, are blotted."
      - "Thy bed, lust-stained, shall with lust’s blood be spotted."
    m:
      - "It’s him! Brave Iago, how honest and trustworthy you are! You even went as far as murder to help your friend in his misfortune. You teach me how I should act. Whore, your lover’s dead now, and you’ll be going to hell soon. I’m coming, slut! I’ve shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart. You’ve already stained our sheets with your lust; now I’ll stain them with your whore’s blood."

    o:

      - "These may be counterfeits. Let’s think ’t unsafe"
      - "To come in to the cry without more help."
    m:
      - "Two or three men are groaning. But it’s dark out, and it could be a trap. It’s not safe to go near them till we get more help."
