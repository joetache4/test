<b>LAERTES</b>
<p>Think it no more.</p>
<p>For nature, crescent, does not grow alone</p>
<p>In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,</p>
<p>The inward service of the mind and soul</p>
<p>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</p>
<p>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</p>
<p>The virtue of his will, but you must fear.</p>
<p>His greatness weighed, his will is not his own,</p>
<p>For he himself is subject to his birth.</p>
<p>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</p>
<p>Carve for himself, for on his choice depends</p>
<p>The safety and health of this whole state.</p>
<p>And therefore must his choice be circumscribed</p>
<p>Unto the voice and yielding of that body</p>
<p>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</p>
<p>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</p>
<p>As he in his particular act and place</p>
<p>May give his saying deed, which is no further</p>
<p>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</p>
<p>Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain</p>
<p>If with too credent ear you list his songs,</p>
<p>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</p>
<p>To his unmastered importunity.</p>
<p>Fear it, Ophelia. Fear it, my dear sister,</p>
<p>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</p>
<p>Out of the shot and danger of desire.</p>
<p>The chariest maid is prodigal enough</p>
<p>If she unmask her beauty to the moon.</p>
<p>Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes.</p>
<p>The canker galls the infants of the spring</p>
<p>Too oft before their buttons be disclosed.</p>
<p>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth,</p>
<p>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</p>
<p>Be wary, then. Best safety lies in fear.</p>
<p>Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>LAERTES</b>
<p>Try to think of it like that, anyway. When a youth grows into a man, he doesn’t just get bigger in his body—his responsibilities grow too. He may love you now, and may have only the best intentions, but you have to be on your guard. Remember that he belongs to the royal family, and his intentions don’t matter that much—he’s a slave to his family obligations. He can’t simply make personal choices for himself the way common people can, since the whole country depends on what he does. His choice has to agree with what the nation wants. So if he says he loves you, you should be wise enough to see that his words only mean as much as the state of Denmark allows them to mean. Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands. Watch out, Ophelia. Just keep your love under control, and don’t let yourself become a target of his lust. Simply exposing your beauty to the moon at night is risky enough—you don’t have to expose yourself to him. Even good girls sometimes get a bad reputation. Worms ruin flowers before they blossom. Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease. So be careful. Fear will keep you safe. Young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others.</p>

<p>And these few precepts in thy memory</p>
<p>Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,</p>
<p>Nor any unproportioned thought his act.</p>
<p>Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar.</p>
<p>Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,</p>
<p>Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,</p>
<p>But do not dull thy palm with entertainment</p>
<p>Of each new-hatched, unfledged comrade. Beware</p>
<p>Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,</p>
<p>Bear ’t that th’ opposèd may beware of thee.</p>
<p>Give every man thy ear but few thy voice.</p>
<p>Take each man’s censure but reserve thy judgment.</p>
<p>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</p>
<p>But not expressed in fancy—rich, not gaudy,</p>
<p>For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</p>
<p>And they in France of the best rank and station</p>
<p>Are of a most select and generous chief in that.</p>
<p>Neither a borrower nor a lender be,</p>
<p>For loan oft loses both itself and friend,</p>
<p>And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.</p>
<p>This above all: to thine own self be true,</p>
<p>And it must follow, as the night the day,</p>
<p>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</p>
<p>Farewell. My blessing season this in thee.</p>

<b>POLONIUS</b>
<p>You’re still here? Shame on you—get on board! The wind is filling your ship’s sail, and they’re waiting for you. Here, I give you my blessing again. And just try to remember a few rules of life. Don’t say what you’re thinking, and don’t be too quick to act on what you think. Be friendly to people but don’t overdo it. Once you’ve tested out your friends and found them trustworthy, hold onto them. But don’t waste your time shaking hands with every new guy you meet. Don’t be quick to pick a fight, but once you’re in one, hold your own. Listen to many people, but talk to few. Hear everyone’s opinion, but reserve your judgment. Spend all you can afford on clothes, but make sure they’re quality, not flashy, since clothes make the man—which is doubly true in France. Don’t borrow money and don’t lend it, since when you lend to a friend, you often lose the friendship as well as the money, and borrowing turns a person into a spendthrift. And, above all, be true to yourself. Then you won’t be false to anybody else. Good-bye, son. I hope my blessing will help you absorb what I’ve said.</p>

<b>POLONIUS</b>
<p>These vows are just traps for stupid birds. I know when a man is on fire, he’ll swear anything. But when a heart’s on fire, it gives out more light than heat, and the fire will be out even before he’s done making his promises. Don’t mistake that for true love. From now on, spend a little less time with him and talk to him less. Make yourself a precious commodity. Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do. In short, Ophelia, don’t believe his love vows, since they’re like flashy pimps who wear nice clothes to lead a woman into filthy acts. To put it plainly, don’t waste your time with Hamlet. Do as I say. Now come along.</p>
