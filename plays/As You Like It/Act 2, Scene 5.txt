  - sp: AMIENS
    o:
      - "*(sings)*"
      - "*Under the greenwood tree*"
      - "*Who loves to lie with me*"
      - "*And turn his merry note*"
      - "*Unto the sweet bird’s throat,*"
      - "*Come hither, come hither, come hither.*"
      - "*Here shall he see*"
      - "*No enemy*"
      - "*But winter and rough weather.*"
    m:
      - "*(singing)*"
      - "*Whoever wants to lie with me,*"
      - "*Under the greenwood tree,*"
      - "*And turn his merry song*"
      - "*To follow the sweet bird’s singing,*"
      - "*Come here, come here, come here.*"
      - "*Here you will find*"
      - "*No enemy*"
      - "*Besides winter and rough weather.*"

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "More, more, I prithee, more."
    m:
      - "More, more, please, more."

  - sp: AMIENS
    o:
      - "It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques."
    m:
      - "It’s only going to make you sad, Monsieur Jaques."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more."
    m:
      - "I’m glad about that. More, please, more. I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs. More, please, more."

  - sp: AMIENS
    o:
      - "My voice is ragged. I know I cannot please you."
    m:
      - "My voice is ragged. I know I won’t please you."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "I do not desire you to please me. I do desire you to sing."
      - "Come, more, another stanzo. Call you ’em “stanzos”?"
    m:
      - "I don’t want you to please me, I want you to sing. Come on, another stanza—is that what you call ’em, “stanzas”?"

  - sp: AMIENS
    o:
      - "What you will, Monsieur Jaques."
    m:
      - "Call them whatever you want, Monsieur Jaques."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "Nay, I care not for their names. They owe me nothing. Will you sing?"
    m:
      - "Nah, I don’t care what their names are; they owe me nothing. Will you sing?"

  - sp: AMIENS
    o:
      - "More at your request than to please myself."
    m:
      - "Okay, but only because you want me to."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you. But that they call “compliment” is like th’ encounter of two dog- apes. And when a man thanks me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing. And you that will not, hold your tongues."
    m:
      - "Well then, if I’ve ever thanked a man, I’ll thank you now. But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together. Whenever a man compliments me, I feel like he’s a beggar and I just gave him a penny—an embarrassing exchange. Come on, sing—and those of you who won’t sing, shut up."

  - sp: AMIENS
    o:
      - "Well, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under this tree.—He hath been all this day to look you."
    m:
      - "Well, I’ll finish the song I started.—Meanwhile, sirs, set the table. The duke will drink under this tree.—He’s been looking for you all day, you know."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is too disputable for my company. I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them. Come, warble, come."
    m:
      - "And I’ve been avoiding him all day. He’s too argumentative for me. I think of as many things as he does, but I just thank heaven and don’t show off about it. Come, warble for me."

  - sp: EVERYONE
    o:
      - "*(singing)*"
      - "*Who doth ambition shun*"
      - "*And loves to live i’ th’ sun,*"
      - "*Seeking the food he eats*"
      - "*And pleased with what he gets,*"
      - "*Come hither, come hither, come hither.*"
      - "*Here shall he see*"
      - "*No enemy*"
      - "*But winter and rough weather.*"
    m:
      - "*(singing)*"
      - "*Whoever shuns ambition*"
      - "*And loves to live in the sun,*"

      - "*If it do come to pass*"
      - "*That any man turn ass,*"
      - "*Leaving his wealth and ease*"
      - "*A stubborn will to please,*"
      - "*Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame.*"
      - "*Here shall he see*"
      - "*Gross fools as he,*"
      - "*An if he will come to me.*"
    m:
      - "And I’ll sing it. *(taking a paper from JAQUES)* It goes like this:"
      - "*(sings)*"
      - "*If it should come to pass*"
      - "*That any man turns into an ass*"
      - "*And leaves his wealth and ease*"
      - "*Simply to please his stubborn will*"
      - "*Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame.*"
      - "*Here he will see*"
      - "*Fools as stupid as he*"
      - "*If he will only come to me.*"

  - sp: AMIENS
    o:
      - "What’s that “ducdame”?"
    m:
      - "What’s that word “ducdame”?"

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "’Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle. I’ll go sleep if I can. If I cannot, I’ll rail against all the first-born of Egypt."
    m:
      - "It’s a Greek invocation, calling fools into a circle. I’m going to take a nap, if I can—if I can’t, I’ll curse all the first-born children of Egypt."

  - sp: AMIENS
    o:
      - "And I’ll go seek the duke. His banquet is prepared."
    m:
      - "And I’ll go find the duke; his banquet is ready."
