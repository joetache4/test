<p>Being “too ill-tempered” is different from being simply “ill-tempered,” right? So I suppose that means I can escape God’s punishment, for in the old proverb, it is said that “God gives an ill-tempered cow short horns” so that she can’t inflict damage on anyone. But it doesn’t say anything about a cow that is <em>too</em> ill-tempered.</p>

<p>The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed</p>

<p>is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For</p>
<p>hear me, Hero, wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a</p>
<p>Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace. The first suit is hot</p>
<p>and hasty like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the</p>
<p>wedding, mannerly modest as a measure, full of state and</p>
<p>ancientry; and then comes repentance, and with his bad</p>
<p>legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink</p>
<p>into his grave.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>BEATRICE</b>
<p>But cousin, make sure he woos you properly and appropriately. If he is too insistent, tell him that romance is like a dance: it has its own rhythm and timing. Look, the three stages of romance are like three different dances. The wooing is like a Scottish jig: hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion. The wedding is a like a dance you would do before the King: proper and decorous. Finally, you get to the part where you regret having gotten married in the first place. It is like the lively cinquepace: it goes faster and faster until you eventually topple over and die.</p>

<p><em>(taking off his mask)</em> Though I said my name was Benedick, I heard this news with Claudio’s ears. Of course the Prince wants Hero for himself. Friendship is enduring except when love is involved. Therefore, all lovers should speak for themselves. They should look for themselves, without asking someone else to get involved in their affairs. Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion. This happens a lot, but it didn’t occur to me that it would happen to me. Goodbye then, Hero.</p>

She told me—not realizing it was me—that I was the Prince’s jester and as dull as mud. She hurled mocking insults at me with such incredible speed that all I could do was stand there, paralyzed. She speaks daggers, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her words, she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star. I wouldn’t marry her, even if she were as blessed as paradise. If she were married to the great hero Hercules, she would have humiliated him with chores around the house and ordered him to chop up his famous club for firewood. Please, don’t mention her. She’s as wicked as Ate, just disguised in pretty clothes. I wish to God that some wise man would conjure her away, because as long as she lives on earth, our lives are filled with turmoil. It’s quieter in hell, where people, sinning on purpose, are eager to be sent just to get away from her. So chaos, horror, and sorrow follow her wherever she goes.</p>

We men will trick Benedick so that, despite his quick wit and his queasiness about marriage, he will fall in love with her. If we can do this, then we will steal Cupid’s glory.
