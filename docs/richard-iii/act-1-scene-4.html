<p>Who from my cabin tempted me to walk</p>
<p>Upon the hatches. Thence we looked toward England</p>
<p>And cited up a thousand fearful times,</p>
<p>During the wars of York and Lancaster</p>
<p>That had befall’n us. As we paced along</p>
<p>Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,</p>

<p>Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard</p>
<p>Into the tumbling billows of the main.</p>
<p>O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,</p>
<p>What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,</p>
<p>What sights of ugly death within my eyes.</p>
<p>Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks,</p>
<p>A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon,</p>
<p>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,</p>

<b>CLARENCE</b>
<p>I thought I had escaped from the Tower and was on a ship to France with my brother Richard, who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him. Looking toward England, we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we’d had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters. As we were pacing the deck, which was tipping heavily, Richard seemed to stumble, and as I tried to grab hold of him and keep him from falling, he knocked me overboard into the crashing waves. Lord, how painful it was to drown. The sound of the rushing water was terrible, and so were the sights. I saw a thousand shipwrecks, a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone, huge anchors, chunks of gold, heaps of pearls, and precious jewels—all scattered on the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.</p>

The first to greet me there was my great father-in-law, the famous earl of Warwick. He cried aloud, “What terrible punishment can this dark realm devise for the oath-breaker Clarence?” And he vanished. Then a ghost like an angel with its hair spattered in blood wandered by, and shieked,</p>

<p>I won’t bother with it. Conscience makes a man a coward. If he steals, it accuses him. If he wants to swear, it restrains him. If he sleeps with his neighbor’s wife, it exposes him. It blushes, is easily embarrassed, and stages regular uprisings in a man’s heart. It’s just too much trouble. It once made me return a purse full of money that I found—it turns anyone who treats it decently into a beggar. It has been thrown out of all sorts of towns and cities it visits, and anyone who wants to live well should learn to trust only himself and live without it.</p>
