<p>Why, headstrong liberty is lashed with woe.</p>
<p>There’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye</p>

<p>The beasts, the fishes, and the wingèd fowls</p>
<p>Are their males’ subjects and at their controls.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>LUCIANA</b>
<p>Why, too much freedom leads to woe. There’s nothing under heaven that doesn’t have its limits. The beasts on the earth, the fish in the sea, and the birds in the sky are all subject to the males of their species and under their control. Men, who are nearest to God, are the masters of all these creatures. And men—the lords of the wide world and the wild watery seas, gifted with intellectual sense and souls, greater than the fish and the birds—are the masters of women and their lords. Therefore, you should obey their wishes.</p>

<p>Patience unmoved! No marvel though she pause;</p>
<p>They can be meek that have no other cause.</p>
<p>A wretched soul, bruised with adversity</p>
<p>We bid be quiet when we hear it cry,</p>
<p>But were we burdened with like weight of pain,</p>
<p>As much or more we should ourselves complain.</p>
<p>So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,</p>

<b>ADRIANA</b>
<p>Now that’s patience! No wonder she’s waiting to get married. It’s easy to preach meekness when you have no reason to act otherwise. When we’re faced with a wretched person, bruised and crying with hardship, we try to get them to shush up. And yet, if we were suffering the same kind of pain, we’d complain just as much—if not more! So you, who have no husband causing you problems, want to comfort me by preaching the virtue of feeble patience. But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights, this foolish patience will abandon you.</p>

If my conversation is no longer free and clever, that’s because he’s dulled it—I’m like a sharp tool he’s blunted with a hard piece of marble. Is he charmed by their pretty clothes? Well, that’s not my fault—he’s the one in charge of my spending. What faults can you find in me that weren’t first caused by him? One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty. But like an unruly deer, he’s always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures. I am nothing but a poor, used fool.</p>

I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me. Even the best jewel can be tarnished. Gold, however, can’t be corrupted—though it can be worn down if it’s touched too often. And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior. Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband, I’ll weep away what’s left and then die with weeping.</p>
