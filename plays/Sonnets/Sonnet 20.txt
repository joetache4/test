      - "A woman’s face, with nature’s own hand painted,"
      - "Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;"
      - "A woman’s gentle heart, but not acquainted"
      - "With shifting change, as is false women’s fashion;"
      - "An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,"
      - "Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;"
      - "A man in hue, all hues in his controlling,"
      - "Which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth."
      - "And for a woman wert thou first created,"
      - "Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,"
      - "And by addition me of thee defeated,"
      - "By adding one thing to my purpose nothing."
      - "  But since she pricked thee out for women’s pleasure,"
      - "  Mine be thy love, and thy love’s use their treasure."

      - "Your face is as pretty as a woman’s, but you don’t even have to use makeup—you, the man (or should I say*woman*?) I love. Your heart is as gentle as a woman’s, but it isn’t cheating like theirs. Your eyes are prettier than women’s, but not as roving—you bless everything you look at. You’ve got the good looks of a handsome man, but you attract both women*and* men. When Mother Nature made you, she originally intended to make you a woman, but then she got carried away with her creation and screwed me by adding a certain*thing* that I have no use for. But since she gave you a prick to please women, I’ll keep your love, and they can enjoy your body."
