<b>BUCKINGHAM</b>
<p>I did. I talked about how he was engaged to Lady Lucy, and how he was engaged to Lady Bona through the help of the earl of Warwick. I spoke of the unquenchable greediness of Edward’s desires and the way he forced himself on the wives of Londoners. I mentioned the way he punished people harshly for minor offenses. I said he was not the son of the noble duke of York, because your father was in France when he was conceived, which explains why he doesn’t have anything in common with his father. And then I suggested that you were the spitting image of your father, both in the way you look and in the nobleness of your character. I went into all your victories in Scotland, your skill as a warrior, your wisdom in peacetime, your generosity, your goodness, and your exceptional modesty. Indeed, I left nothing out. And when my oration came to a close, I asked those who loved their country to cry, “God save Richard, England’s royal king!”</p>

<p>“Thus saith the duke. Thus hath the duke inferred”—</p>
<p>But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.</p>
<p>When he had done, some followers of mine own,</p>
<p>At the lower end of the hall, hurled up their caps,</p>
<p>And some ten voices cried “God save King Richard!”</p>
<p>And thus I took the vantage of those few.</p>
<p>“Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,” quoth I.</p>

<p>No, God help me, they didn’t say a word. Like silent statues or stones that breathed, they just gazed at each other and turned as pale as the dead. When I saw this, I scolded them and asked the mayor what this stubborn silence meant. He said that the people weren’t used to being spoken to except by the Recorder. So I urged the Recorder to repeat my tale—you know, “The duke of Buckingham said this, Buckingham meant that,” but nothing on his own authority. When he was done, a few followers of my own at the far end of the hall hurled their caps in the air. Some ten voices cried, “God save King Richard!” I jumped on this slender opportunity and said, “Thank you, noble citizens and friends. This widespread applause and enthusiastic shouts make clear you stand behind Richard.” And then I broke off and quickly came away.</p>

<p>If not to answer, you might haply think</p>
<p>Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</p>
<p>To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</p>
<p>Which fondly you would here impose on me.</p>
<p>If to reprove you for this suit of yours,</p>

<p>Then on the other side I checked my friends.</p>
<p>Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,</p>
<p>And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,</p>
<p>Definitively thus I answer you:</p>
<p>Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert</p>
<p>Unmeritable shuns your high request.</p>
<p>First, if all obstacles were cut away</p>
<p>And that my path were even to the crown</p>

<p>And in the vapor of my glory smothered.</p>

<p>Will well become the seat of majesty,</p>
<p>And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.</p>

<b>RICHARD</b>
<p>I can’t tell which is the better course of action, to leave in silence or to scold you. If I don’t answer, perhaps you’ll think I’m accepting the heavy responsibility you foolishly want to impose on me. But if I do speak and refuse your request, then I’m guilty of reprimanding my friends, who have been faithful and loving toward me. So, I’ll speak to make clear I don’t want the crown but also that I am grateful to you. Here is my definitive answer: thank you for your love, but I’m going to have to turn down your weighty request because I don’t deserve to be king. First of all, even if all the obstacles were eliminated and my path led straight to the crown—if it were truly my birthright—I would rather hide from my greatness than hide inside the greatness of the position itself and be smothered by it. My spirit is poor, and I have so many terrible defects that as king I would be like a little boat tossed about on a mighty sea. So, thank God, there is no real need for me, as I wouldn’t be able to help you much. The royal tree has left us other fruit, which, with time, will do just fine on the throne and make us all happy as king, I’m sure. Someone other than I has the right and the good fortune to be made king. God forbid that I snatch the crown from him.</p>

<p>My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace,</p>
<p>But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,</p>
<p>All circumstances well considerèd.</p>
<p>You say that Edward is your brother’s son;</p>
<p>So say we too, but not by Edward’s wife.</p>
<p>For first was he contract to Lady Lucy—</p>
<p>Your mother lives a witness to that vow—</p>
<p>And afterward by substitute betrothed</p>
<p>To Bona, sister to the king of France.</p>
<p>These both put off, a poor petitioner,</p>
<p>A care-crazed mother to a many sons,</p>
<p>A beauty-waning and distressèd widow,</p>
<p>Even in the afternoon of her best days,</p>
<p>Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,</p>
<p>Seduced the pitch and height of his degree</p>
<p>To base declension and loathed bigamy.</p>
<p>By her in his unlawful bed he got</p>
<p>This Edward, whom our manners term “the Prince.”</p>
<p>More bitterly could I expostulate,</p>
<p>Save that, for reverence to some alive,</p>
<p>I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</p>
<p>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</p>
<p>This proffered benefit of dignity,</p>
<p>If not to bless us and the land withal,</p>
<p>Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</p>
<p>From the corruption of abusing times</p>
<p>Unto a lineal, true-derivèd course.</p>

<b>BUCKINGHAM</b>
<p>My lord, what you’ve said makes clear you have a conscience, but your objections are trivial, given the circumstances. You say that Prince Edward is your brother’s son. We agree, but not by your brother’s wife. King Edward was going to marry Lady Lucy—your mother can vouch for that—and then he was betrothed to Bona, the King of France’s sister-in-law. But both of these were put off by Elizabeth Grey, a careworn mother of many children who had once been a beauty but was now a stressed-out widow long past her prime. Nevertheless, under pretence of asking a favor of him, she attracted his lustful eye and seduced him so thoroughly that he completely debased himself, committing adultery with her. It resulted in this Edward, whom we’re polite enough to call “Prince.” Out of respect for the living, I’ll restrain myself from telling you everything. But, my good lord, if you don’t care about this country, at least use your own pure lineage to rescue us from the current corruption of the royal line.</p>

<p>If you refuse it, as in love and zeal</p>

<p>Perhaps you refuse our request out of love for your brother’s son. You don’t want to depose the child. We know how tender your heart is and what gentle, kind, womanly feelings you have for your relatives, as well as for people from all walks of life. But listen, if <em>you</em> won’t become king, we’ll just get someone else, to the disgrace and ruin of your family. We will not have your brother’s son as king. On this note, we’re leaving. Come, citizens. Damn it, I’m not going to beg anymore!</p>

<p>Buckingham, my brother, and you wise, serious men, since you intend to force me to take responsibility for these changing times, whether I want to or not, I’m going to have to be brave and endure the load.

God knows, and you may have noticed, I’m not to eager to take on this job.</p>
