<p>I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayst thou art, born</p>
<p>under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral medicine to a</p>
<p>mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am. I must be sad</p>
<p>when I have cause and smile at no man’s jests, eat when I</p>
<p>have stomach and wait for no man’s leisure, sleep when I am</p>
<p>drowsy and tend on no man’s business, laugh when I am</p>
<p>merry and claw no man in his humor.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>DON JOHN</b>
<p>I’m amazed that you—being such a moody man yourself—are moralizing about my deadly condition. I can’t hide what I am. I’ll be sad when I have reason to be sad and won’t smile at anybody’s jokes. I’ll eat when I’m hungry and won’t wait until it’s convenient. I’ll sleep when I’m tired and won’t rouse myself for anything. I’ll laugh when I’m happy and won’t flatter and fawn over anyone.</p>

<b>CONRAD</b>
<p>Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you</p>
<p>may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out</p>
<p>against your brother, and he hath ta’en you newly into his</p>
<p>grace, where it is impossible you should take true root but</p>
<p>by the fair weather that you make yourself. It is needful that</p>
<p>you frame the season for your own harvest.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>CONRAD</b>
<p>Sure, but don’t do it at full volume until there’s no danger in it. Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother, and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you. You need to act carefully if you’re going to stay in his good graces. You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose.</p>

<b>DON JOHN</b>
<p>I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace,</p>
<p>and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to</p>
<p>fashion a carriage to rob love from any. In this, though I</p>
<p>cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be</p>
<p>denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a</p>
<p>muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have</p>
<p>decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would</p>
<p>bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking. In the</p>
<p>meantime, let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>DON JOHN</b>
<p>I’d rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother’s garden. It suits me more to be hated by everyone than to put on a fancy show and trick people into loving me. Though I am not a flattering, righteous man, at least you can say that I am honest about being a villain. My brother trusts me now? Yeah—as much as a master trusts the dog he muzzles or the peasant he “frees” by chaining a big block around the man’s foot. If my mouth were unrestrained, I’d bite. If I were free, I’d do what I pleased. Until that happens, let me be who I am and don’t try to change me.</p>
