  - sp: PROVOST
    o:
      - "I am the provost. What’s your will, good friar?"
    m:
      - "I am the provost. What do you want, good friar?"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Bound by my charity and my blest order,"
      - "I come to visit the afflicted spirits"
      - "Here in the prison. Do me the common right"
      - "To let me see them and to make me know"
      - "The nature of their crimes, that I may minister"
      - "To them accordingly."
    m:
      - "My sense of charity and my religious order make it my duty to come visit the troubled souls here in prison. Grant me the clergy’s usual right to see them, and tell me the nature of their crimes, so I may minister to them accordingly."

  - sp: PROVOST
    o:
      - "I would do more than that, if more were needful."
    m:
      - "I’d do more than that, if it were needed."

  - os: "Enter JULIET"
    ms: "JULIET enters."

  - o:
      - "Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,"
      - "Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,"

      - "And he that got it, sentenced; a young man"
      - "More fit to do another such offence"
      - "Than die for this."
    m:
      - "Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman in my charge who, by giving in to her youthful passion, has ruined her reputation. She’s pregnant, and the child’s father is sentenced to death. He’s just a young man, who deserves the chance to make more babies, rather than to die for this one."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "When must he die?"
    m:

    m:
      - "I’ve gotten accommodations for you. Wait here, and you’ll be escorted to them."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?"
    m:
      - "Pretty one, do you repent the sin you’re carrying?"

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "I do; and bear the shame most patiently."
    m:
      - "I do, and patiently bear the shame."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "I’ll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,"
      - "And try your penitence, if it be sound,"
      - "Or hollowly put on."
    m:
      - "I’ll teach you how to examine your conscience, and to test if your repentance is real or insincere."

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "I’ll gladly learn."
    m:
      - "I’ll gladly learn."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Love you the man that wrong’d you?"
    m:
      - "Do you love the man who wronged you?"

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "Yes, as I love the woman that wrong’d him."
    m:
      - "Yes, as I love myself, the woman who wronged him."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "So then it seems your most offenceful act"
      - "Was mutually committed?"
    m:
      - "So then it seems your sinful act was mutually committed?"

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "Mutually."
    m:
      - "Mutually."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Then was your sin of heavier kind than his."
    m:
      - "But your sin is heavier than his."

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "I do confess it, and repent it, father."
    m:
      - "I do confess it, and repent it, father."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "’Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,"
      - "As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,"
      - "Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,"
      - "Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,"
      - "But as we stand in fear,—"
    m:
      - "That’s appropriate, daughter. But if you’re only sorry because your sin’s been found out, that’s being sorry for yourself, not for offending Heaven. We tend to repent out of fear of God, rather than love for him—"

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "I do repent me, as it is an evil,"
      - "And take the shame with joy."
    m:
      - "I repent because my act was evil. I’m happy to be ashamed of it."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO

      - "And I am going with instruction to him."
      - "Grace go with you, Benedicite!"
    m:
      - "Maintain that attitude. I hear your partner must die tomorrow, and I’m going to give him spiritual guidance. Grace go with you, and God bless you!"

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,"
      - "That respites me a life, whose very comfort"
      - "Is still a dying horror!"
    m:
      - "Must die tomorrow! Oh, painful love! By making me pregnant, it’s spared my life. But that comfort means I have to live with the horror of Claudio’s death."

  - sp: PROVOST
    o:
      - "’Tis pity of him."
    m:
      - "He’s to be pitied."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
