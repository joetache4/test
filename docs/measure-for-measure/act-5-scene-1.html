<b>FRIAR PETER</b>
<p>Well, in time he may come to clear himself, but at this instant he’s sick, my lord, suffering a rare fever. Learning there was an accusation planned against Lord Angelo, he personally asked me to come here and speak, as he would have, about what he knows is true and false. And when he’s summoned, he’ll give his oath and furnish proof that will clear everything up. This worthy nobleman, who’s been so publicly and personally accused, will be vindicated, and this woman will be discredited to her face, to such an extent that she herself will have to admit it.</p>

But after he condemned your brother, he committed two crimes, violating your virginity and breaking his promise about the pardon that your brother’s life depended on. Even the merciful part of the law cries out, “an Angelo for Claudio, death for death!” Haste always results in hasty decisions, and deliberation comes from slowness. One thing is rewarded by a similar thing, and the measure of justice you use will be the measure used against you. So, Angelo, your crime is clear for all to see, and it denies you the right to any preferential treatment, even if you yourself feel otherwise. I sentence you to be executed on the very block where Claudio knelt to die, and just as quickly. Take him away!</p>

<p>He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.</p>
<p>By this Lord Angelo perceives he’s safe;</p>
<p>Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.</p>
<p>Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:</p>
<p>Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.</p>
<p>I find an apt remission in myself;</p>
<p>And yet here’s one in place I cannot pardon. <em>(to LUCIO)</em> You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,</p>
<p>One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;</p>
<p>Wherein have I so deserved of you,</p>
<p>That you extol me thus?</p>

<p><em>(to ISABELLA)</em> If he resembles your brother, then for his sake, he’s pardoned. And for your own lovely sake, give me your hand and say you’ll be mine. He’s my brother, too, but there’ll be a more appropriate time for that. By the way Angelo is behaving, I think he realizes this means he’s safe. Well, Angelo, your evil has repaid you well. Make sure you love your wife since her worth is equal to yours. I’m feeling merciful, and yet here’s someone I can’t forgive. <em>(to LUCIO)</em> You, who called me a fool, a coward, a lecher, an ass, a madman. What did I ever do to you that you call me these things?</p>

A greater expression of my gratitude is yet to come. Thanks, provost, for your care and ability to keep secrets. I’m going to give you a better position. Forgive him, Angelo, for bringing you Ragozine’s head in place of Claudio’s. The crime redeems itself. Dear Isabel, I have a proposal that’s greatly to your benefit, if you’ll lend a willing ear.
