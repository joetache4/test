She speaks daggers, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her words, she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star. I wouldn’t marry her, even if she were as blessed as paradise. If she were married to the great hero Hercules, she would have humiliated him with chores around the house and ordered him to chop up his famous club for firewood. Please, don’t mention her. She’s as wicked as Ate, just disguised in pretty clothes. I wish to God that some wise man would conjure her away, because as long as she lives on earth, our lives are filled with turmoil. It’s quieter in hell, where people, sinning on purpose, are eager to be sent just to get away from her. So chaos, horror, and sorrow follow her wherever she goes.</p>

<p>I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another</p>
<p>man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love, will,</p>
<p>after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others,</p>
<p>become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love—</p>
<p>and such a man is Claudio. I have known when there was no</p>
<p>music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he</p>
<p>rather hear the tabor and the pipe. I have known when he</p>
<p>would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and</p>
<p>now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new</p>
<p>doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose,</p>
<p>like an honest man and a soldier, and now is he turned</p>
<p>orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just</p>
<p>so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with</p>
<p>these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not.</p>
<p>I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster,</p>
<p>but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me,</p>
<p>he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet</p>
<p>I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous,</p>
<p>yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one</p>
<p>woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s</p>
<p>certain; wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen</p>
<p>her; fair, or I’ll ever look on her; mild, or come not near</p>
<p>me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an</p>
<p>excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what color it</p>
<p>please God. Ha! The Prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide</p>
<p>me in the arbor.</p>

<p>I’m amazed that a man, after watching romance turn another man into a fool and laughing at that man, can turn right around and become the thing he’s scorned. That’s the kind of man Claudio is. I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe. I knew him when he would’ve walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket. He used to speak plainly and to the point, like an honorable man and soldier; now his speech is elaborate and flowery. His words are like a miraculous banquet, full of strange new dishes. Will I be changed like that, and see the world through a lover’s eyes? I’m not sure, but I don’t think so. I can’t promise that love won’t transform me, but I can promise you this: until I truly fall in love, a woman will never make me act like such a fool. A beautiful woman comes along, but I’m unmoved. A wise woman turns up, but I’m unmoved. A virtuous woman appears, but I’m unmoved. I refuse to fall in love until all three qualities unite in a single woman. She must be rich, certainly, and smart, or I’ll have nothing to do with her. She has to be virtuous, or I’ll never bid on her; beautiful, or I won’t bother to look at her. Mild-mannered, or else she should stay away from me. Noble, or I won’t have her even if she’s an angel. She must be well spoken, an excellent musician, and her hair should be—well, I suppose the color doesn’t matter. Ha! Look, it’s the Prince and Mr. Love. I’ll hide in the arbor.</p>

<b>BENEDICK</b>
<p><em>(coming forward)</em> This can’t be a trick. They spoke with great seriousness, and they have Hero’s testimony. They seem to pity the lady. It seems her love is stretched to the limit. She loves me? Well, that love must be returned! I hear how I’m criticized. They say I’ll be smug if I find out she loves me. They also say she’d rather die than give any sign of her feelings. I never thought I’d marry. I can’t appear to be proud. People who discover their faults and can then change them are lucky indeed. They say the lady is beautiful; it’s true, I’ve seen it myself. And virtuous; that’s true, I can’t disprove that. And smart, except that she loves me. That may not be any proof of her intelligence, but I swear it won’t be evidence of her stupidity—for I’m going to be horribly in love with her! People might tease me here and there, since I attacked marriage for so long. But don’t tastes change? A man can love a dish when he is young that he hates when he turns old. Will quips and clever remarks and scathing written words keep a man from getting what his heart desires? No! The world needs to be populated. When I said that I’d die as a bachelor, I just meant that I didn’t think I’d live until I got married. Here comes Beatrice. By God! She’s a beautiful lady. I think I sense some signs of love in her.</p>

<p>Marry, this, well carried, shall on her behalf</p>
<p>Change slander to remorse. That is some good.</p>
<p>But not for that dream I on this strange course,</p>
<p>But on this travail look for greater birth.</p>
<p>She, dying, as it must so be maintained,</p>
<p>Upon the instant that she was accused,</p>
<p>Shall be lamented, pitied and excused</p>
<p>Of every hearer. For it so falls out</p>
<p>That what we have we prize not to the worth</p>
<p>Whiles we enjoy it, but being lacked and lost,</p>
<p>Why then we rack the value, then we find</p>
<p>The virtue that possession would not show us</p>
<p>Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio.</p>
<p>When he shall hear she died upon his words,</p>
<p>The idea of her life shall sweetly creep</p>
<p>Into his study of imagination,</p>
<p>And every lovely organ of her life</p>
<p>Shall come apparelled in more precious habit,</p>
<p>More moving, delicate and full of life,</p>
<p>Into the eye and prospect of his soul</p>
<p>Than when she lived indeed. Then shall he mourn,</p>
<p>If ever love had interest in his liver,</p>
<p>And wish he had not so accused her,</p>
<p>No, though he thought his accusation true.</p>
<p>Let this be so, and doubt not but success</p>
<p>Will fashion the event in better shape</p>
<p>Than I can lay it down in likelihood.</p>
<p>But if all aim but this be leveled false,</p>
<p>The supposition of the lady’s death</p>
<p>Will quench the wonder of her infamy.</p>
<p>And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,</p>
<p>As best befits her wounded reputation,</p>
<p>In some reclusive and religious life,</p>
<p>Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>FRIAR FRANCIS</b>
<p>Listen, if we do this correctly, the men who slandered Hero will feel remorse for her instead. That will be a good thing. But I have an even greater goal in mind. We’ll maintain that she died the instant she was accused, and everyone who hears this will grieve for her, pity her, and excuse her actions. That’s how it goes: we don’t value the things we have until we lose them, when we suddenly rack up their value and see all the virtues we were blind to when they were alive and with us. That’s how Claudio will respond. When he hears that she died from his words, his imagination will be sweetly overtaken by thoughts of her. In death, every aspect of her life will be got up more beautifully, and in his mind she will seem more moving, more delicate, and more lively even than when she was alive. Then, if he ever truly felt love, he’ll mourn and wish he hadn’t accused her—even though he believed his accusation to be true. Follow my plan, and trust that the actual events will play out even better than I am describing. And even if they don’t, at least Hero’s supposed death will stop the rumors of her infidelity. And if it doesn’t go well, then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery, the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputation—away from the public’s eyes, tongues, mind, and insults.</p>

<p>But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.</p>
<p>Bring me a father that so loved his child,</p>
<p>Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine,</p>
<p>And bid him speak of patience.</p>

<p>And let it answer every strain for strain,</p>
<p>As thus for thus and such a grief for such,</p>
<p>In every lineament, branch, shape, and form.</p>

<p>Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk</p>
<p>With candle-wasters, bring him yet to me</p>
<p>And I of him will gather patience.</p>
<p>But there is no such man. For, brother, men</p>
<p>Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief</p>
<p>Which they themselves not feel, but, tasting it,</p>
<p>Their counsel turns to passion which before</p>
<p>Would give preceptial med’cine to rage,</p>
<p>Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,</p>
<p>Charm ache with air, and agony with words.</p>
<p>No, no, ’tis all men’s office to speak patience</p>

<b>LEONATO</b>
<p>Stop advising me; your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve. Don’t counsel me. Only someone who’s been wronged as I have can comfort me. Find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and ask<em>him</em> to be patient. Compare the length and width of that man’s sadness against my own; match up all the complaints and strong emotions that run through our bodies. If a man who has suffered as I have gave me advice the way you do—smiling and stroking his beard, telling me to toss away my sorrow, giving speeches when he should be wailing with me, trying to heal my grief with little proverbs, spinning my head around with philosophy—then I would take his advice and be patient. But that man doesn’t exist. You can try to comfort a man who feels a pain that you have never felt, but once you feel it too, your sober advice will also turn into passion. You can’t treat madness with rules or bind up insanity with little silken threads or cure heartache with hot air or lighten agony with pat phrases. Every man thinks it’s his duty to advise those who are overwrought with sorrow to be patient. But no man is so moral or so strong that they can endure the same advice when they themselves are grieving. So don’t advise me. My sorrow is crying too loudly to hear what you have to say.</p>

Marry, I cannot show it in rhyme. I have tried. I can find out no rhyme to “lady” but “baby”—an innocent rhyme; for “scorn,” “horn”—a hard rhyme; for, “school,” “fool”—a babbling rhyme; very ominous endings.

But I can’t prove it in a poem. I have tried. I can’t think of any rhyme for “lady” but “baby,” which is a childish rhyme. The only rhyme for “scorn” I can come up with is “horn”—a bit off for a love poem. Nothing rhymes with “school” but “fool,” and that’s a ridiculous jingle. These are all very unpromising line endings. No, I wasn’t destined to be a poet, and I can’t woo a lady with pretty words.</p>
