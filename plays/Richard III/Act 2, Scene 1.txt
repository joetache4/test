      - "And what you do, do it unfeignedly."
    m:
      - "*(to QUEEN ELIZABETH)* Madam, you’re not exempt from this—nor are you, Dorset— nor you, Buckingham. You have had too many separate factions among you. My dear wife, let Lord Hastings kiss your hand. And don’t do it merely for appearance’s sake."

      - "Be he unto me: this do I beg of God"
      - "When I am cold in love to you or yours."
    m:
      - "*(to QUEEN ELIZABETH)* If I ever turn my hatred toward your majesty, and do not love and cherish you and yours, may God punish me. May I find hatred where I most expect love. When I most need a friend, and when I’m sure I have one, make him treacherous and deceitful to me. I beg God to do all this whenever I fail to show love to you or yours."

  - os: "They embrace"
    ms: "They embrace."

  - sp: KING EDWARD IV
    o:
      - "A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,"

      - "There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here"
      - "To make the blessèd period of this peace."
    m:
      - "Noble Buckingham, your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart. All we need to put the final touches on this future peace is for Richard to appear."

      - "And, princely peers, a happy time of day."
    m:
      - "Good morning to my sovereign king and queen. Noble peers, how nice to see you."

  - sp: KING EDWARD IV
    o:
      - "Happy indeed, as we have spent the day."
      - "Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,"
      - "Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,"
      - "Between these swelling, wrong-incensèd peers."
    m:
      - "Happy indeed, the way we have spent the day. Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity, turning enmity into peace and hate into love among these mistakenly angry nobles."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "A blessèd labor, my most sovereign lord."
      - "Amongst this princely heap, if any here"
      - "By false intelligence, or wrong surmise"
      - "Hold me a foe,"
      - "If I unwittingly, or in my rage,"
      - "Have aught committed that is hardly borne"
      - "By any in this presence, I desire"
      - "To reconcile me to his friendly peace."
      - "’Tis death to me to be at enmity;"
      - "I hate it, and desire all good men’s love."
      - "First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,"
      - "Which I will purchase with my duteous service;—"
      - "Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,"
      - "If ever any grudge were lodged between us;—"
      - "Of you and you, Lord Rivers and of Dorset,"
      - "That all without desert have frowned on me;—"
      - "Of you, Lord Woodeville and Lord Scales;— of you,"
      - "Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all."
      - "I do not know that Englishman alive"
      - "With whom my soul is any jot at odds"
      - "More than the infant that is born tonight."
      - "I thank my God for my humility."
    m:
      - "What blessed work, my king. If there’s anyone among this princely group who mistakes me for an enemy—if by accident or in anger I have done anything to offend you—I want to join with you in peaceful friendship. It kills me to be enemies with you. I hate it and want all good men’s love. *(to QUEEN ELIZABETH)* First, madam, I want there to be peace between you and me, which I will buy with my obedient service to you. And peace with you, my noble cousin Buckingham, if you ever felt any grudge against me; and with you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, with you. In fact, I want to get along with everyone who has frowned on me without good cause—dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen, everyone. There is not an Englishman alive with whom I’m at odds, anymore than a newborn baby would be. I thank God for my humbleness."

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "A holy day shall this be kept hereafter."
      - "I would to God all strifes were well compounded."
      - "My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness"
      - "To take our brother Clarence to your grace."
    m:
      - "Today shall always be remembered as a holy day. If only all struggles ended this well. One more thing, my dear majesty. Please pardon our brother Clarence."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Why, madam, have I offered love for this,"
      - "To be so flouted in this royal presence?"
      - "Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?"
    m:
      - "Why, madam, have I offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king? Who doesn’t know that the good duke is dead?"

  - os: "They all start"
    ms: "They all start."

  - o:
      - "You do him injury to scorn his corse."
    m:
      - "You do him wrong to laugh at his corpse."

  - sp: KING EDWARD IV
    o:
      - "Who knows not he is dead! Who knows he is?"
    m:
      - "Who doesn’t know he’s dead? Who says he is?"

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!"
    m:
      - "Oh my God, what a terrible world this is!"

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?"
    m:
      - "Do I look as pale as everyone else does, Lord Dorset?"

  - sp: DORSET
    o:
      - "Ay, my good lord, and no one in the presence"
      - "But his red color hath forsook his cheeks."
    m:
      - "You do, my good lord. Everyone here has turned white."

  - sp: KING EDWARD IV
    o:
      - "Is Clarence dead? The order was reversed."
    m:
      - "Is Clarence dead? But I reversed the death sentence."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "But he, poor man, by your first order died,"
      - "And that a wingèd Mercury did bear."
      - "Some tardy cripple bear the countermand,"
      - "That came too lag to see him burièd."
      - "God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,"
      - "Nearer in bloody thoughts, and not in blood,"
      - "Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,"
      - "And yet go current from suspicion."
    m:
      - "Well, the poor man died by your first order, which was carried by a winged messenger. Some tardy cripple must have taken the counter-order, who came after Clarence was already buried. It’s clear that someone less noble, less loyal, more bloody-minded than Clarence but not a blood relation, deserves as bad an end as my brother, but he goes free."

  - os: "Enter Lord STANLEY, Earl of Derby"
    ms: "Lord STANLEY, Earl of Derby, enters."

  - sp: STANLEY
    o:
      - "*(kneeling)* A boon, my sovereign, for my service done."

  - sp: KING EDWARD IV
    o:
      - "I prithee, peace. My soul is full of sorrow."
    m:
      - "Please be quiet. My soul is full of sorrow."

  - sp: STANLEY
    o:
      - "I will not rise unless your Highness hear me."
    m:
      - "I will not rise until your Highness hears me."

  - sp: KING EDWARD IV
    o:
      - "Then say at once what is it thou requests."
    m:
      - "Then hurry up and tell me what you want."

  - sp: STANLEY
    o:
      - "The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant’s life,"
      - "Who slew today a riotous gentleman"
      - "Lately attendant on the duke of Norfolk."
    m:
      - "That you lift the death sentence on my servant, who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of Norfolk."

  - sp: KING EDWARD IV
    o:
      - "Have I a tongue to doom my brother’s death,"
      - "And shall the tongue give pardon to a slave?"
      - "My brother killed no man; his fault was thought,"
      - "And yet his punishment was bitter death."
      - "Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,"
      - "Kneeled at my feet, and bade me be advised?"
      - "Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?"
      - "Who told me how the poor soul did forsake"
      - "The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?"
      - "Who told me, in the field by Tewkesbury,"
      - "When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,"
      - "And said “Dear brother, live, and be a king”?"
      - "Who told me, when we both lay in the field"
      - "Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me"
      - "Even in his garments and did give himself,"
      - "All thin and naked, to the numb-cold night?"
      - "All this from my remembrance brutish wrath"
      - "Sinfully plucked, and not a man of you"
      - "Had so much grace to put it in my mind."
      - "But when your carters or your waiting vassals"
      - "Have done a drunken slaughter and defaced"
      - "The precious image of our dear Redeemer,"
      - "You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon,"
      - "And I, unjustly too, must grant it you."
      - "*Stanley rises*"
      - "But for my brother, not a man would speak,"
      - "Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself"
      - "For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all"
      - "Have been beholding to him in his life,"
      - "Yet none of you would once beg for his life."
      - "O God, I fear Thy justice will take hold"
      - "On me and you, and mine and yours for this!—"
      - "Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.—"
      - "Ah, poor Clarence."
    m:
      - "I was willing to condemn my brother to death, but you want me to pardon a peasant? My brother didn’t kill anyone. He was only to blame for some thoughts he had. But his punishment was bitter death. Who pleaded with me to pardon *his* life? Who, when I was in a rage, kneeled at my feet and told me to reconsider? Who talked about brotherhood? Who talked about love? Who told me how the poor man abandoned the mighty earl of Warwick to fight for me? Who told me how he rescued me in the field at Tewksbury, when Oxford had me down, saying, “Dear brother, live and be a king”? Who told me how, when we both lay in the field freezing to death, he wrapped me in his own clothes and spent a numbingly cold night naked? I forgot all of this in my brutish anger, and not one of you had the grace to remind me. But when your servants get drunk and kill someone, you go right down on your knees for “pardon, pardon.” And, though he doesn’t deserve it, I have to grant your request. But not one of you would speak up for my brother. And I didn’t speak to myself on his behalf, either. The best of you owed something to him in his lifetime, but none of you would plead for his life. Oh God, I fear your justice will destroy me and all of these men, and their families and mine, because of this! Come, Hastings, help me to my room. Oh, poor Clarence."

  - os: "Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN ELIZABETH"
    ms: "KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN ELIZABETH exit with several others."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "This is the fruits of rashness. Marked you not"
      - "How that the guilty kindred of the queen"
      - "Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence’ death?"
      - "O, they did urge it still unto the king."
      - "God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go"
      - "To comfort Edward with our company?"
    m:
      - "This is what happens when you act rashly. Did you notice how the queen’s guilty relatives turned pale when they heard about Clarence’s death? Oh, they continually urged the king to do it. God will revenge it. But come, lords, will you come with me to Edward’s room to comfort him?"

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "We wait upon your Grace."
    m:
      - "We’ll come with you, your Grace."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They all exit."
