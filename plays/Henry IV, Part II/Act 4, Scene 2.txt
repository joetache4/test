  - os: "Alarum. Excursions. Enter FALSTAFF and COLEVILE, meeting"
    ms: "Calls to arms are sounded. Soldiers cross the stage. FALSTAFF and COLEVILE enter and confront one another."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "What’s your name, sir? Of what condition are you, and of"
      - "what place, I pray?"
    m:
      - "What’s your name, sir? What’s your rank, and where are you from?"

  - sp: COLEVILE
    o:
      - "I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the Dale."
    m:
      - "I am a knight, sir. My name is Coleville of the Valley."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your degree,"
      - "and your place the Dale. Colevile shall be still your name, a"
      - "traitor your degree, and the dungeon your place, a place deep"
      - "enough so shall you be still Colevile of the Dale."
    m:
      - "Well, then, Coleville is your name, your rank is knight, and the valley is where you’re from. Coleville will still be your name now that “traitor” is your rank, and the dungeon is where you’ll be. It’s a place so deep that you’ll still be in a kind of valley."

  - sp: COLEVILE
    o:
      - "Are not you Sir John Falstaff?"
    m:
      - "Aren’t you Sir John Falstaff?"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "As good a man as he, sir, whoe’er I am. Do ye yield, sir, or"
      - "shall I sweat for you? If I do sweat, they are the drops of thy"
      - "lovers and they weep for thy death. Therefore rouse up fear"
      - "and trembling, and do observance to my mercy."
    m:
      - "I’m as good a man as Falstaff, whoever I am. Will you surrender? Or am I going to have to break a sweat making you surrender? If I sweat, the drops will be the tears of your loved ones, weeping over your death. So you’d better get scared and start to shake, and start praying to me for mercy."

  - sp: COLEVILE
    o:
      - "I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that thought yield"
      - "me."
    m:
      - "I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and so I surrender."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name. An I had but a belly of any indifferency, I were simply the most active fellow in Europe. My womb, my womb, my womb undoes me. Here comes our general."
    m:
      - "My enormous belly can speak in many languages, and each language proclaims my name and my name alone. If I had a moderately sized belly, all I’d be is an anonymous but very successful soldier. But my belly, my belly, my belly blows my cover. Here comes the general."

  - os: "Enter Prince John of LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND, BLUNT, and others"
    ms: "John of LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND, BLUNT, and others enter."

  - sp: LANCASTER
    o:
      - "The heat is past. Follow no further now."
    m:
      - "The danger’s over: let’s stop here."

  - os: "A retreat is sounded."
    ms: "The trumpets sound a retreat."

  - o:
      - "Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland."
    m:
      - "Call off the operation, Westmoreland."

  - os: "Exit WESTMORELAND"
    ms: "WESTMORELAND exits."

  - o:
      - "Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?"
      - "When everything is ended, then you come."
      - "These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,"
      - "One time or other break some gallows’ back."
    m:
      - "Falstaff, where have you been all this time? When everything is over, that’s when you start. This habit of laziness of yours will bust a gallows to bits one of these days, mark my words."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus. I never knew"
      - "yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valor. Do you"
      - "think me a swallow, an arrow, or a bullet? Have I in my poor"
      - "and old motion the expedition of thought? I have speeded"
      - "hither with the very extremest inch of possibility. I have"
      - "foundered ninescore and odd posts, and here, travel-tainted"
      - "as I am, have in my pure and immaculate valor taken Sir"
      - "John Colevile of the Dale, a most furious knight and"
      - "valorous enemy. But what of that? He saw me and yielded,"
      - "that I may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,"
      - "“There, cousin, I came, saw, and overcame.”"
    m:
      - "I’m sorry to hear you say that: I never realized that brave behavior should be rewarded with scolding and admonishing. Do you think I’m a bird, or an arrow, or a bullet? With this old, broken-down body, do you think I can move as fast as thought? I’ve gotten here as fast as humanly possible. I’ve burned out more than 180 horses, and—even though I’m spent from all that travel—I’ve managed, with my extraordinary bravery, to capture Sir John Coleville of the Valley, a brave knight and terrible enemy. But so what? He simply saw me and surrendered. So I can say, just like Julius Caesar, that “I came, I saw, I conquered.”"

  - sp: LANCASTER
    o:
      - "It was more of his courtesy than your deserving."
    m:
      - "He was just being polite; it’s not as if you did something to deserve it."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "I know not. Here he is, and here I yield him. And I beseech"
      - "your Grace let it be booked with the rest of this day’s deeds,"
      - "or, by the Lord, I will have it in a particular ballad else, with"
      - "mine own picture on the top on ’t, Colevile kissing my foot;"
      - "to the which course if I be enforced, if you do not all show"
      - "like gilt twopences to me, and I in the clear sky of fame o’ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element (which show like pins’ heads to her), believe not the word of the noble. Therefore let me have right, and let desert mount."
    m:
      - "I don’t know about that. Here he is: I turn him over to you. Please, sir, have it added to the record of things accomplished today. If you don’t, I’ll have a ballad printed about it, with a picture of Coleville kissing my foot on the cover. And if I’m forced to do that, and I don’t make you look like counterfeits next to me, and if my fame doesn’t outshine yours like the full moon outshines the stars (which look like pin pricks in the sky next to the moon)—well then, you can call me a liar. Now give me what I deserve, and let my merits mount on top of each other, in a great pile."

  - sp: LANCASTER
    o:
      - "Thine’s too heavy to mount."
    m:
      - "Your pile would be too heavy for me to bear."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Let it shine, then."
    m:
      - "Let my merits shine, then."

  - sp: LANCASTER
    o:
      - "Thine’s too thick to shine."
    m:
      - "You’re too dense to shine."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me good, and"
      - "call it what you will."
    m:
      - "Then let it do something that will do me good, whatever you want to call it."

  - sp: LANCASTER
    o:
      - "Is thy name Colevile?"
    m:
      - "Is your name Coleville?"

  - sp: COLEVILE
    o:
      - "  It is, my lord."
    m:
      - "It is, sir."

  - sp: LANCASTER
    o:
      - "A famous rebel art thou, Colevile."
    m:
      - "You’re a famous rebel, Coleville."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "And a famous true subject took him."
    m:
      - "And a famous and loyal subject captured him."

  - sp: COLEVILE
    o:
      - "I am, my lord, but as my betters are"
      - "That led me hither. Had they been ruled by me,"
      - "You should have won them dearer than you have."
    m:
      - "I’m now in the same situation as my superiors, who led me here. But if I had been in charge, your victory would have cost you more than it has."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "I know not how they sold themselves, but thou, like a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis, and I thank thee for thee."
    m:
      - "I don’t know how much your superiors cost us, but you, like a generous man, gave yourself away for free, and I thank you for it."

  - os: "Enter WESTMORELAND"
    ms: "WESTMORELAND enters."

  - sp: LANCASTER
    o:
      - "Now, have you left pursuit?"
    m:
      - "Have you called off the troops?"

  - sp: WESTMORELAND
    o:
      - "Retreat is made and execution stayed."
    m:
      - "The order to pull back has been given, and the slaughter has been stopped."

  - sp: LANCASTER
    o:
      - "Send Colevile with his confederates"
      - "To York, to present execution.—"
      - "Blunt, lead him hence, and see you guard him sure."
    m:
      - "Send Coleville and his confederates to York, to be put to death immediately. Blunt, lead him away, and guard him carefully."

  - os: "Exeunt BLUNT with COLEVILE"
    ms: "BLUNT exits with COLEVILLE."

  - o:
      - "And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords."
      - "I hear the King my father is sore sick."
      - "Our news shall go before us to his Majesty,"
      - "*(to WESTMORELAND)* Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort"
      - "  him,"
      - "And we with sober speed will follow you."
    m:
      - "And now, let’s get going back to the royal court: I understand that the King, my father, is gravely ill. Send news of our victory ahead of us. *(to WESTMORELAND)* You, cousin, will bring him this news and comfort him with it. We’ll follow you as quickly as we can."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "My lord, I beseech you give me leave to go through"
      - "Gloucestershire, and, when you come to court, stand my"
      - "good lord, pray, in your good report."
    m:
      - "Sir, please give me permission to go via Gloucestershire. When you get to the court, please vouch for my good work here."

  - sp: LANCASTER
    o:
      - "Fare you well, Falstaff. I, in my condition,"
      - "Shall better speak of you than you deserve."
    m:
      - "Goodbye, Falstaff. By speaking on your behalf as a prince, I’ll be speaking better of you than you deserve."

  - os: "Exeunt all but FALSTAFF"
    ms: "Everyone exits except FALSTAFF."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "I would you had but the wit; ’twere better than your"
      - "dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy"
      - "doth not love me, nor a man cannot make him laugh. But"
      - "that’s no marvel; he drinks no wine. There’s never none of"
      - "these demure boys come to any proof, for thin drink doth so"
      - "overcool their blood, and making many fish meals, that they"
      - "fall into a kind of male green-sickness, and then, when they"
      - "marry, they get wenches. They are generally fools and"
      - "cowards, which some of us should be too, but for"
      - "inflammation."
      - "A good sherris sack hath a two-fold operation in it. It"
      - "ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and"
      - "dull and crury vapors which environ it, makes it"
      - "apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and"
      - "delectable shapes, which, delivered o’er to the voice, the"
      - "tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The"
      - "second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of"
      - "the blood, which, before cold and settled, left the liver white"
      - "and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice."
      - "But the sherris warms it and makes it course from the"
      - "inwards to the parts’ extremes. It illumineth the face, which"
      - "as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little"
      - "kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and"
      - "inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart,"
      - "who, great and puffed up with this retinue, doth any deed of"
      - "courage, and this valor comes of sherris. So that skill in the"
      - "weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and"
      - "learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack"
      - "commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that"
      - "Prince Harry is valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally"
      - "inherit of his father he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land,"
      - "manured, husbanded, and tilled with excellent endeavor of"
      - "drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is"
      - "become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the"
      - "first human principle I would teach them should be to"
      - "forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack."
    m:
      - "I wish you had the wit to accomplish that: it would be worth all your land. My goodness, this young, serious-minded boy doesn’t like me, and no one can make him laugh. But I guess that’s not surprising; after all, he doesn’t drink any wine. None of those prim boys ever amount to anything: weak beer and too many fish dinners makes their blood cool. They all turn anemic, like young girls. And then, when they finally get married, they can only father girls because they don’t have the stuff to produce sons. Non-drinkers are all generally fools and cowards. The rest of us would probably be the same way, except that we’re always drunk. A good sherry wine operates in two ways. First, it rises into the brain and dries out all the foolish, dull, clogged-up fogs that have gathered there. It makes the brain sharp, quick, and inventive; full of nimble, fiery, and beautiful ideas. The voice and tongue give birth to those ideas which, when they grow up, become excellent wit. The second power of good wine is the warming of the blood. Before wine, the blood is cold and sluggish, and this makes the liver—the organ of passion—chilly and pale. A chilly, pale liver is the sign of cowardice and faint-heartedness. But wine warms the blood, making it course from the inner organs to all the extremities. The blood brightens the face, and the rest of the body—which is like a little kingdom in itself—takes that brightening as a signal. Then the spirits of the blood and all the internal organs gather together behind their captain: the heart. The heart draws strength from these followers and, enlarged by them, can accomplish any courageous deed. This is the bravery that comes from wine. Without wine, skill in weaponry doesn’t matter. Wine is what sets that skill in motion. Education is nothing more than idle gold in the devil’s hands, until wine rouses it and puts it to good use. That’s how Prince Harry became valiant. He’s taken the cold blood he inherited from his father and—like unproductive farmland—he fertilized it, planted it, and cared for it, through the hard work of drinking vast amounts of good and potent wine. And so now, he’s become hot and courageous. If I had a thousand sons, the first rule of behavior I would teach them would be to avoid weak drinks, and get themselves addicted to wine."

      - "How now, Bardolph?"
    m:
      - "What is it, Bardolph?"

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "The army is discharged all and gone."
    m:
      - "The army is dismissed, and everyone’s gone."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Let them go. I’ll through Gloucestershire, and there will I"
      - "visit Master Robert Shallow, Esquire. I have him already"
      - "temp’ring between my finger and my thumb, and shortly"
      - "will I seal with him. Come away."
    m:
      - "Let them go. I’ll head to Gloucestershire. I’ll visit Master Robert Shallow, Esquire. I’ve already got him under my thumb, as soft as wax. Soon I’ll seal the deal. Let’s go."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
