    m:
      - "Oh, look, Titinius, look! Those villains, our soldiers, flee! I’ve become an enemy to my own soldiers! This standard-bearer here of mine was running away, so I killed him and took the flag from him. *(points to his flag)*"

    o:
      - "O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,"
      - "Who, having some advantage on Octavius,"
      - "Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,"
      - "Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed."
    m:

    m:
      - "Titinius, if you love me, get on your horse and spur him on until he’s brought you to those troops and back again, so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies."

      - "*(to PINDARUS)*    Sirrah, what news?"
    m:
      - "Today was the day I breathed my first breath. Time has come round, and I’ll end where I began. My life has run its circle. *(to PINDARUS)* What can you see, boy?"

    m:
      - "Come here, boy. I took you prisoner in Parthia, and at that time I made you swear to try to do whatever I ordered you to, except take your own life. Come now, keep your oath. *(gives his sword to PINDARUS)* Now you’ll be a free man. Take this good sword, which ran through Caesar’s bowels, and plunge it in my chest. Don’t hesitate. Here, take the handle, and when my face is covered as it is now, use the sword."

      - "Where never Roman shall take note of him."
    m:
      - "So I’m free. But I didn’t want to be free like this. Oh, Cassius, I’ll run far from this country to where no Romans can find me."

    o:
      - "It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius"
      - "Is overthrown by noble Brutus’ power,"
      - "As Cassius’ legions are by Antony."
    m:
      - "The armies have merely changed places, Titinius, because Octavius has been overthrown by noble Brutus’ forces at the very moment that Antony overthrew Cassius’ legions."

  - sp: TITINIUS
    o:
      - "These tidings will well comfort Cassius."
    m:
      - "This news will comfort Cassius."

    o:
      - "Is not that he?"
    m:
      - "Isn’t that him?"

  - sp: TITINIUS
    o:
      - "  No, this was he, Messala,"
      - "But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,"
      - "As in thy red rays thou dost sink tonight,"
      - "So in his red blood Cassius’ day is set."
      - "The sun of Rome is set. Our day is gone."
      - "Clouds, dews, and dangers come! Our deeds are done."
      - "Mistrust of my success hath done this deed."
    m:
      - "No, it *was* him, Messala, but Cassius is no more. Just as the sun’s rays turn red when it sets, so Cassius has ended his life in a pool of red blood. The sun of Rome has set! Our day is over. Clouds, dew, and dangers approach. We’re finished! He didn’t believe I would ever return on my mission, and so he killed himself."

  - sp: MESSALA
    o:
      - "Mistrust of good success hath done this deed."
      - "O hateful error, melancholy’s child,"
      - "Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men"
      - "The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,"
      - "Thou never comest unto a happy birth"
      - "But kill’st the mother that engendered thee!"
    m:
      - "Yes, he killed himself because he thought we’d lost the whole battle. Sadness, which misconstrues reality, gave birth to his errors in thinking—and then destroyed him."

  - sp: TITINIUS
    o:
      - "What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?"
    m:
      - "Pindarus! Where are you, Pindarus?"

  - sp: MESSALA
    o:
      - "Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet"
      - "The noble Brutus, thrusting this report"
      - "Into his ears. I may say “thrusting” it,"
      - "For piercing steel and darts envenomèd"
      - "Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus"
      - "As tidings of this sight."
    m:
      - "Look for him, Titinius, while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news. I say “force” because Brutus would rather I stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this."

  - sp: TITINIUS
    o:
      - "    Hie you, Messala,"
      - "And I will seek for Pindarus the while."
    m:
      - "Hurry, Messala, and I’ll look for Pindarus in the meantime."

  - os: "Exit MESSALA"
    ms: "MESSALA exits."

  - o:
      - "Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?"
      - "Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they"
      - "Put on my brows this wreath of victory"
      - "And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?"
      - "Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!"
      - "But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow."
      - "Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I"
      - "Will do his bidding."
      - "*(lays wreath on CASSIUS’ head)* Brutus, come apace,"
      - "And see how I regarded Caius Cassius."
      - "—By your leave, gods, this is a Roman’s part."
      - "Come, Cassius’ sword, and find Titinius’ heart."
      - "*(stabs himself with CASSIUS’ sword and dies)*"
    m:
      - "Why did you send me out, brave Cassius? Didn’t I meet up with your allies? And didn’t they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you? Didn’t you hear their shouts? Alas, you misunderstood everything! But let me place this wreath on your head. Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you, and I’ll do what he says. *(he lays a wreath on CASSIUS’ head)* Brutus, come this way and see how much I admired Caius Cassius. With your permission, gods, this is a Roman’s duty. Come, Cassius’ sword, and strike Titinius’ heart. *(he stabs himself with CASSIUS’ sword and dies.)*"

    m:
      - "Could you have found two Romans as good as these two? Good-bye to you, the last of all the Romans. Rome will never produce your equal. Friends, I owe more tears to this dead man than you will see me shed. I will find the time to cry for you, Cassius, I’ll find the time. Come, then, and send his body to Thasos. We won’t have his funeral at our camp, because it might make us too sad to fight. Lucillius, come. And come, young Cato. Let’s proceed to the field. Labio and Flavio, push our armies onward. It is three o’clock, and, Romans, before night, we will try our luck in a second battle."
