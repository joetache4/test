    o:
      - "All the infections that the sun sucks up"
      - "From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him"
      - "By inchmeal a disease! His spirits hear me"
      - "And yet I needs must curse. But they’ll nor pinch,"
      - "Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i’ th’ mire,"
      - "Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark"
      - "Out of my way, unless he bid ’em. But"
      - "For every trifle are they set upon me,"
      - "Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me,"
      - "And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which"
      - "Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount"
      - "Their pricks at my footfall. Sometime am I"
      - "All wound with adders who with cloven tongues"
      - "Do hiss me into madness."
    m:
      - "I hope all the diseases that breed in swamps and marshes infect Prospero, inch by inch, until he’s nothing but a walking disease! His spirits are listening to me, but I can’t help cursing him anyway. They won’t pinch me, frighten me, push me in the mud, or mislead me unless he tells them to. But he sends them to punish me for every little thing. Sometimes his spirits take the form of apes, grimacing and chattering at me and then biting me; sometimes they come like porcupines, my feet as I walk. Sometimes snakes wrap around me, hissing at me with their forked tongues till I go crazy."

    ms: "TRINCULO enters."

  - o:
      - "    Lo, now, lo!"
      - "Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me"
      - "For bringing wood in slowly. I’ll fall flat."
      - "Perchance he will not mind me."
      - "*(lies down, covered by his gaberdine)*"
    m:
      - "Hey, look over there! Here comes one of his spirits to torture me for taking so long to bring the wood back. I’ll lie down and hide. Maybe he won’t see me. *(he lies down and covers himself with his cloak)*"

  - sp: TRINCULO
    o:
      - "Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all."
      - "And another storm brewing, I hear it sing i’ th’ wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. *(sees CALIBAN)*"
      - "What have we here? A man or a fish? Dead or alive? A fish. He smells like a fish, a very ancient and fish-like smell, a kind of not-of-the-newest poor-john. A strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver. There would this monster make a man. Any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like arms! Warm, o’ my troth. I do now let loose my opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt."
    m:
      - "There are no bushes or shrubs to protect me from the weather here. And there’s another storm brewing—I can hear it in the way the wind whistles. That huge black cloud over there looks like a filthy liquor jug that’s about to pour out its contents. It won’t be able to help pouring rain down by the bucket-full. *(he sees CALIBAN)* What do we have here, a man or a fish? Whew, he stinks like a fish—an old salted fish, not a fresh-caught one. A strange fish. If I were in England now, like I was once, and I had even a painted picture of this fish, every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it. In England this strange monster would be just like a man. Any strange beast there can be considered a man. The men there won’t give a penny to a lame beggar, but they’ll pay ten cents to look at a freak show exhibit. This guy has legs like a man but fins for arms! And he’s still warm, by God. I guess this is not a fish, but a native who got struck by lightning just now."

  - o:
      - "Alas, the storm is come again! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine. There is no other shelter hereabouts. Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past."
      - "*(crawls under gaberdine)*"
    m:
      - "Oh, here comes the storm again. The best thing to do is crawl under his cloak. There’s no other shelter around here. In emergencies you meet the strangest folks. I’ll just stay here till the storm passes. *(he crawls under CALIBAN’s cloak)*"

Or it hath been said, “As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground,” and it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at’ nostrils."
    m:
      - "What’s going on? Do we have devils on the island? Are you playing tricks on me by showing me savages and uncivilized men from the Indies, ha? I didn’t survive a shipwreck so I could be scared of your four legs now. I’ll never run away from any ordinary man who walks on four legs like the rest of us."

If I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he’s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat’s leather."
    m:

I’ll help out, if only because he speaks the same language as me. If I can cure him from his fever and tame him, and get him back to Naples, he’d make a great present for any emperor."

    m:
      - "He’s having a fit and talking nonsense. I’ll give him some liquor. If he’s never drunk it before, it’ll help soothe his fever. If I can tame him, I’ll charge as much as I can get for him. He’ll bring a lot of money to the person who owns him, that’s for sure."

  - sp: STEPHANO
    o:

    m:
