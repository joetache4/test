      - "Thou blind fool love, what dost thou to mine eyes,"
      - "That they behold, and see not what they see?"
      - "They know what beauty is, see where it lies,"
      - "Yet what the best is take the worst to be."
      - "If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks"
      - "Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,"
      - "Why of eyes’ falsehood hast thou forgèd hooks,"
      - "Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?"
      - "Why should my heart think that a several plot"
      - "Which my heart knows the wide world’s common place?"
      - "Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,"
      - "To put fair truth upon so foul a face?"
      - "  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,"
      - "  And to this false plague are they now transferred."

      - "Love, you blind fool, what are you doing to my eyes that’s keeping them from accurately seeing what I look at? My eyes know what beauty is, and they see who has it, yet they decide that the worst woman is the best. Love, if my vision has been distorted because I look at her with too much bias, spending all my time staring at this woman who sleeps with every man, why have you used my misperceptions as a trap to fool my heart, so that I love the wrong person? Why should my heart think that she could belong to one man when my heart knows she’s available to the whole world? Or why should my eyes witness her promiscuity but act like it’s not true, putting a good face on an ugly truth? My heart and my eyes have been completely mistaken about the truth, and now they both love this unfaithful disease of a woman."
