  - os: "Enter LAUNCELOT the clown and JESSICA"
    ms: "LAUNCELOT and JESSICA enter."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children. Therefore I promise ye I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be o’ good cheer, for truly I think you are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither."
    m:
      - "Yes, look, it’s true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers. That’s why I’m worried about you. I’ve always been straightforward with you, so now I’m telling you what I think. Cheer up, because I think you’re going to hell. There’s only one hope for you, and even that’s a kind of illegitimate hope."

  - sp: JESSICA
    o:
      - "And what hope is that, I pray thee?"
    m:
      - "What hope is that, may I ask?"

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew’s daughter."
    m:
      - "You can hope your father isn’t your real father. Maybe your mother fooled around, and you aren’t the Jew’s daughter."

  - sp: JESSICA
    o:
      - "That were a kind of bastard hope indeed. So the sins of my mother should be visited upon me."
    m:
      - "That really is an illegitimate hope. Then I’d be punished for the sins of my mother."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother. Thus when I shun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are gone both ways."
    m:
      - "In that case I’m afraid you’re damned by both your father and your mother. When you avoid one trap, you fall into another. You’re in trouble either way."

  - sp: JESSICA
    o:
      - "I shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a"
      - "Christian."
    m:
      - "My husband will save me. He’s made me a Christian."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "Truly, the more to blame he. We were Christians eno’ before, e’en as many as could well live one by another. This making Christians will raise the price of hogs. If we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money."
    m:
      - "He was wrong to do that. There were enough Christians before—as many of them as could stand to live near each other. All these new Christians will make the price of hogs go up. If we’re all pork-eaters, we won’t be able to get our hands on a slice of bacon, even if we’ve got the money for it."

  - os: "Enter LORENZO"
    ms: "LORENZO enters."

  - sp: JESSICA
    o:
      - "I’ll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say. Here he comes."
    m:
      - "I’ll tell my husband what you’ve said, Launcelot. Here he comes."

  - sp: LORENZO
    o:
      - "I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you thus get my wife into corners."
    m:
      - "You’re going to make me jealous, Launcelot, if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this!"

  - sp: JESSICA
    o:
      - "Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelot and I are out. He tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew’s daughter, and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork."
    m:
      - "No, you don’t need to worry about us, Lorenzo. Launcelot and I can’t agree on anything. He says I won’t get into heaven because I’m a Jew’s daughter, and he says you’re irresponsible because by converting Jews to Christianity you’re raising the price of pork."

  - sp: LORENZO
    o:
      - "I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the Negro’s belly. The Moor is with child by you, Launcelot."
    m:
      - "I can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with Portia’s African servant. The Moor is pregnant with your child, Launcelot."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "It is much that the Moor should be more than reason. But if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for."
    m:
      - "It’s too bad there’s more of the Moor than there ought to be. Well, even if she’s a less than honest woman, she’s still a lot *more* respectable than I thought at first."

  - sp: LORENZO
    o:
      - "How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots. Go in, sirrah. Bid them prepare for dinner."
    m:
      - "Any fool can make puns! I think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence, and talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do. Go in and tell the servants to get ready for dinner."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "That is done, sir. They have all stomachs."
    m:
      - "That’s already been done, sir. They’re all ready to eat dinner."

  - sp: LORENZO
    o:
      - "Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner."
    m:
      - "Good Lord, what a clown you are! Tell them to *make* the dinner."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "That is done too, sir. Only “Cover!” is the word."
    m:
      - "That’s also been done, sir. The word you’re looking for is “cover .”"

  - sp: LORENZO
    o:
      - "Will you cover then, sir?"
    m:
      - "Will you cover, then?"

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "Not so, sir, neither. I know my duty."
    m:
      - "No, sir—I know my duty."

  - sp: LORENZO
    o:
      - "Yet more quarreling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray thee, understand a plain man in his plain meaning. Go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner."
    m:
      - "You keep finding ways to mock me! Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once? Please understand my simple message: go tell the servants to set the table and bring in the food, and we’ll come in to dinner."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "For the table, sir, it shall be served in. For the meat, sir, it shall be covered. For your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and conceits shall govern."
    m:
      - "About the table, sir, dinner will be served on it. As for the food, it will be served in covered dishes. As for your coming in to dinner, just do what you feel is right."

  - os: "Exit LAUNCELOT"
    ms: "LAUNCELOT exits."

  - sp: LORENZO
    o:
      - "O dear discretion, how his words are suited!"
      - "The fool hath planted in his memory"
      - "An army of good words, and I do know"
      - "A many fools that stand in better place,"
      - "Garnished like him, that for a tricksy word"
      - "Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?"
      - "And now, good sweet, say thy opinion."
      - "How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife?"
    m:
      - "Oh, he’s good at bending words around! The fool has memorized a whole army full of fancy words. I know jesters in better positions, with the same talents he has. They also like to digress from the topic at hand by playing with language. Anyway, how are you, Jessica? And how do you like Lord Bassanio’s wife?"

  - sp: JESSICA
    o:
      - "Past all expressing. It is very meet"
      - "The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,"
      - "For having such a blessing in his lady,"
      - "He finds the joys of heaven here on earth."
      - "And if on earth he do not merit it,"
      - "In reason he should never come to heaven."
      - "Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match"
      - "And on the wager lay two earthly women,"
      - "And Portia one, there must be something else"
      - "Pawned with the other, for the poor rude world"
      - "Hath not her fellow."
    m:
      - "I like her more than I can say. Bassanio should live an upstanding life because having a wife like Portia is a blessing. It’s as if he found heaven here on earth. And if he doesn’t deserve this joy on earth, he’ll never deserve it in heaven. Imagine what would happen if two gods in heaven made a bet. If one of them used Portia as his stake, the other god would have a hard time coming up with a human woman to match her value. The poor rude world doesn’t have her equal."

  - sp: LORENZO
    o:
      - "  Even such a husband"
      - "Hast thou of me as she is for a wife."
    m:
      - "As good a wife as she is, that’s how good a husband I am to you."

  - sp: JESSICA
    o:
      - "Nay, but ask my opinion too of that!"
    m:
      - "I’ll be the judge of that!"

  - sp: LORENZO
    o:
      - "I will anon. First let us go to dinner."
    m:
      - "I’ll give you a chance to judge later. First let’s go to dinner."

  - sp: JESSICA
    o:
      - "Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach."
    m:
      - "No, let me say some good things about you while I’m in the mood."

  - sp: LORENZO
    o:
      - "No, pray thee, let it serve for table talk."
      - "Then howsome’er thou speak’st ’mong other things"
      - "I shall digest it."
    m:
      - "No, please, save it for dinner conversation. That way, no matter what you say, I’ll digest it with everything else."

  - sp: JESSICA
    o:
      - "  Well, I’ll set you forth."
    m:
      - "In that case I’ll serve you up like a dish of food."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
