<p>I hear it by the way; but I will send.</p>
<p>There’s not a one of them but in his house</p>
<p>I keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow—</p>
<p>And betimes I will—to the weird sisters.</p>
<p>More shall they speak, for now I am bent to know,</p>
<p>By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,</p>
<p>All causes shall give way. I am in blood</p>
<p>Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more,</p>
<p>Returning were as tedious as go o’er.</p>
<p>Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,</p>
<p>Which must be acted ere they may be scanned.</p>

<p>I’ve heard about this indirectly, but I will send for him. In every one of the lords’ households I have a servant paid to spy for me. Tomorrow, while it’s still early, I will go see the witches. They will tell me more, because I’m determined to know the worst about what’s going to happen. My own safety is the only important thing now. I have walked so far into this river of blood that even if I stopped now, it would be as hard to go back to being good as it is to keep killing people. I have some schemes in my head that I’m planning to put into action. I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them.</p>

<p>Yes, let’s go to sleep. My strange self-delusions just come from inexperience. We’re still just beginners when it comes to crime.</p>
