<p>As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,</p>
<p>Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune’s womb,</p>
<p>Is coming towards me, and my inward soul</p>

<p>More than with parting from my lord the king.</p>

<p>I promised that to make the king happy, but for myself I cannot do it. I don’t know why I should be so sad, except that I had to say goodbye to my sweet Richard.

<p>Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,</p>
<p>Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;</p>
<p>For sorrow’s eye, glazed with blinding tears,</p>
<p>Divides one thing entire to many objects;</p>
<p>Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon</p>
<p>Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry</p>
<p>Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,</p>
<p>Looking awry upon your lord’s departure,</p>
<p>Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;</p>
<p>Which, look’d on as it is, is nought but shadows</p>
<p>Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,</p>
<p>More than your lord’s departure weep not: more’s not seen;</p>
<p>Or if it be, ’tis with false sorrow’s eye,</p>
<p>Which for things true weeps things imaginary.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>BUSHY</b>
<p>When you’re already sad it seems like everything is awful and your grief is multiplied. But, in reality, that’s not the case. Because you’re sad, things don’t appear to you as they actually are, so in your husband’s departure you see many things to grieve. Those are just shadows. So don’t cry for anything but your husband’s leaving. Any other causes of grief are just imaginary.</p>

<p>Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.</p>

<p>Far from it. Imaginary feelings of grief are always the result of some real, prior grief. But that’s not my situation, as nothing has happened to me to cause my grief. My grief is reversed: I feel a grief whose cause I haven’t experienced yet. But I don’t know what that is. I can’t name it. All I know is that it’s a nameless sadness.</p>
