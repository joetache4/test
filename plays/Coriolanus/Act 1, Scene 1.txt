  - os: "Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons"
    ms: "A mob of angry Citizens enters. They are carrying staffs, clubs, and other weapons."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Before we proceed any further, hear me speak."
    m:
      - "Before we go any further, listen to me."

  - sp: ALL
    o:
      - "Speak, speak."
    m:
      - "Speak, speak."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?"
    m:
      - "Are you all certain that you’d rather die fighting than starve to death?"

  - sp: ALL
    o:
      - "Resolved. resolved."
    m:
      - "Yes, we’re certain."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people."
    m:
      - "As you know, Caius Martius is our chief enemy."

  - sp: ALL
    o:
      - "We know’t, we know’t."
    m:
      - "Yes, we know."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Let us kill him, and we’ll have corn at our own price."
      - "Is’t a verdict?"
    m:
      - "Let’s kill him, so we can sell our corn at the price we choose. Are we agreed?"

  - sp: ALL
    o:
      - "No more talking on’t; let it be done: away, away!"
    m:
      - "No need to talk about this anymore—let’s do it. Let’s go."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "One word, good citizens."
    m:
      - "May I speak, good citizens?"

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good."
      - "What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they"
      - "would yield us but the superfluity, while it were"
      - "wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;"
      - "but they think we are too dear: the leanness that"
      - "afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an"
      - "inventory to particularise their abundance; our"
      - "sufferance is a gain to them. Let us revenge this with"
      - "our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I"
      - "speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge."
    m:
      - "We’re poor. The nobles are rich. The nobles have so much to eat that they overindulge and get sick, but if they’d only give us their excess food, we wouldn’t be starving any longer. We’d think they were compassionate if they helped us, but they think we’re too expensive to feed and don’t deserve to eat. They look at our thin, starving bodies and see them as a measure of their own abundance. Our suffering shows them how much they have. Let’s seek revenge with our pitchforks before we become as thin as rakes. The gods know I only say this because I’m hungry for bread, not thirsty for revenge."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Would you proceed especially against Caius Martius?"
    m:
      - "Would you attack Caius Martius in particular?"

  - sp: ALL
    o:
      - "Against him first: he’s a very dog to the commonalty."
    m:
      - "We should attack him first. He’s like a cruel dog to the people."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Consider you what services he has done for his country?"
    m:
      - "Have you considered the ways he has served our country?"

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Very well; and could be content to give him good"
      - "report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud."
    m:
      - "I’ve considered them very well, and I’d be happy to honor him for his service, except he already honors himself by being proud."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Nay, but speak not maliciously."
    m:
      - "Don’t speak so harshly."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did"
      - "it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be"
      - "content to say it was for his country he did it to"
      - "please his mother and to be partly proud; which he"
      - "is, even till the altitude of his virtue."
    m:
      - "Listen, all that he’s famous for doing, he did simply to become famous. Slow-witted men can be content to say he acted on behalf of his country, but the truth is that he fought to please his mother and also, in part, out of pride. He has just as much pride as courage."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "What he cannot help in his nature, you account a"
      - "vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous."
    m:
      - "You call it a vice, but being proud is his nature. And you can’t accuse him of being interested in the spoils of war."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;"
      - "he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition."
    m:
      - "Even if I stop accusing him of pride, I’ll still have plenty of other complaints against him.  He has so many faults, I grow tired of repeating them to you."

  - os: "Shouts within"
    ms: "Shouts come from offstage."

  - o:
      - "What shouts are these? The other side o’ the city"
      - "is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!"
    m:
      - "Who’s shouting? The other side of the city is taking action. Why are we standing around talking? Let’s go to the capitol!"

  - sp: ALL
    o:
      - "Come, come."
    m:
      - "Let’s go."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:

    m:
      - "Wait, who’s coming?"

  - os: "Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA"

    o:

      - "the people."
    m:
      - "It’s worthy Menenius Agrippa, one who has always loved the people."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "He’s one honest enough: would all the rest were so!"
    m:
      - "He’s decent enough. I wish that all the other nobles were!"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "What work’s, my countrymen, in hand? where go you"
      - "With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you."
    m:
      - "What are you working on, my countrymen? Where are you going with bats and clubs? What’s the matter? Please tell me."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have"
      - "had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,"
      - "which now we’ll show ’em in deeds. They say poor"
      - "suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we"
      - "have strong arms too."
    m:
      - "The Senate knows what we’re upset about. They’ve known for two weeks what we intend to do, and now we’re going to show them. They say poor workers have bad breath. They’re about to find out that we have strong arms too."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,"
      - "Will you undo yourselves?"
    m:
      - "Masters, my good friends, my honest neighbors, why will you harm yourselves?"

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "We cannot, sir, we are undone already."
    m:
      - "We’re already hurt."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "I tell you, friends, most charitable care"
      - "Have the patricians of you. For your wants,"
      - "Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well"
      - "Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them"
      - "Against the Roman state, whose course will on"
      - "The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs"
      - "Of more strong link asunder than can ever"
      - "Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,"
      - "The gods, not the patricians, make it, and"
      - "Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,"
      - "You are transported by calamity"
      - "Thither where more attends you, and you slander"
      - "The helms o’ the state, who care for you like fathers,"
      - "When you curse them as enemies."
    m:
      - "I tell you, friends, the nobles take very good care of you. For the relief you want from your suffering, you’d do just as well to rise up against the heavens as against the Roman state. The Senate isn’t going to change its course. However strong a chain you form, the Senate will break you because it’s ten thousand times stronger. The gods, not the nobles, are responsible for whatever you lack, therefore you should fall to your knees and pray, not raise your arms and fight. You’re getting carried away by your calamity, and you’re only inviting more trouble. You’re slandering the senators, cursing them as your enemies, without realizing that they care for you like fathers care for their children."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Care for us! True, indeed! They ne’er cared for us"
      - "yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses"
      - "crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to"
      - "support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act"
      - "established against the rich, and provide more"
      - "piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain"
      - "the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and"
      - "there’s all the love they bear us."
    m:
      - "Care for us? As if! They’ve never cared for us. They force us to starve while their storehouses are full of grain. They make laws about loaning money that protect the loan sharks. Every day they repeal the laws that interfere with the interests of the wealthy and instead make strict laws to chain up and restrain the poor. If the wars we fight in don’t kill us, these laws will. That’s how well they care for us."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Either you must"
      - "Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,"
      - "Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you"
      - "A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;"
      - "But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture"
      - "To stale ’t a little more."
    m:
      - "You must either admit that you’re being extremely malicious or you’ll be accused of foolishness. I’ll tell you a relevant story. You may have heard it, but since it illustrates my point, I’ll venture to tell it again."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Well, I’ll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to"
      - "fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an ’t please"
      - "you, deliver."
    m:
      - "Well, I’ll listen sir, but don’t think you can trick us out of our suffering with a story. But if it pleases you, tell it."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "There was a time when all the body’s members"
      - "Rebell’d against the belly, thus accused it:"
      - "That only like a gulf it did remain"
      - "I’ the midst o’ the body, idle and unactive,"
      - "Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing"
      - "Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments"
      - "Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,"
      - "And, mutually participate, did minister"
      - "Unto the appetite and affection common"
      - "Of the whole body. The belly answer’d—"
    m:
      - "There was a time when all the body’s parts rebelled against the belly. They accused the belly of being an idle, inactive pool in the middle the body, always hoarding the food, never working as much as the rest of the parts. The other body parts did see and hear, think, instruct, walk, feel, and together worked for the needs and desires of the whole body. The belly answered—"

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Well, sir, what answer made the belly?"
    m:
      - "Well, sir, what did the belly answer?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,"
      - "Which ne’er came from the lungs, but even thus—"
      - "For, look you, I may make the belly smile"
      - "As well as speak—it tauntingly replied"
      - "To the discontented members, the mutinous parts"
      - "That envied his receipt; even so most fitly"
      - "As you malign our senators for that"
      - "They are not such as you."
    m:
      - "Sir, I’ll tell you. With a disdainful smile—look, I can make the belly smile as well as speak—the belly tauntingly replied to the aggravated, mutinous parts that envied the food it received—much like you who rightly accuse our senators for not starving as you do."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Your belly’s answer? What!"
      - "The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,"
      - "The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,"
      - "Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter."
      - "With other muniments and petty helps"
      - "In this our fabric, if that they—"
    m:
      - "What did the belly say? That the regal head, the watchful eye, the wise heart, the fighting arms, the mobile legs, the expressive tongue, with some small help from the other parts, if they—"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "What then?"
      - "’Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?"
    m:
      - "What then? My word, you’re quite a speaker! What then? What then?"

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Should by the cormorant belly be restrain’d,"
      - "Who is the sink o’ the body,—"
    m:
      - "The greedy belly, the sink of the body, should be restrained—"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Well, what then?"
    m:
      - "And then what?"

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "The former agents, if they did complain,"
      - "What could the belly answer?"
    m:
      - "If the parts complained, what could the belly answer?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "I will tell you"
      - "If you’ll bestow a small—of what you have little—"
      - "Patience awhile, you’ll hear the belly’s answer."
    m:
      - "I’ll tell you. If you’ll exercise a little bit of what little patience you have, you’ll hear the belly’s answer."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Ye’re long about it."
    m:
      - "You’re taking a long time to tell it."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Note me this, good friend;"
      - "Your most grave belly was deliberate,"
      - "Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer’d:"
      - "“True is it, my incorporate friends,” quoth he,"
      - "“That I receive the general food at first,"
      - "Which you do live upon; and fit it is,"
      - "Because I am the store-house and the shop"
      - "Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,"
      - "I send it through the rivers of your blood,"
      - "Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o’ the brain;"
      - "And, through the cranks and offices of man,"
      - "The strongest nerves and small inferior veins"
      - "From me receive that natural competency"
      - "Whereby they live: and though that all at once,"
      - "You, my good friends,”—this says the belly, mark me,—"
    m:
      - "Pay attention, good friend. The belly was serious and deliberate, not rash like his accusers, and so he answered, “It’s true, my fellow parts,” he said, “That I am first to receive the food supply that you live on. This is as it should be, because I am the storehouse and the shop of the whole body. But if you’ll remember, I send it through the rivers of your blood, even to the court of the heart, to the throne of the brain, and through the ducts and chambers of the body, the strongest nerves and small inferior veins receive from me all that they need to survive. And despite all that, you, my good friends,” says the belly—"

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Ay, sir; well, well."
    m:
      - "Yes, sir, go on."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "“Though all at once cannot"
      - "See what I do deliver out to each,"
      - "Yet I can make my audit up, that all"
      - "From me do back receive the flour of all,"
      - "And leave me but the bran.” What say you to’t?"
    m:
      - "“Even though all the parts can’t see at once what I deliver out to each, I can account that all parts receive from me all the flour I get, and that all I’m left with is the bran.” What do you say to that?"

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "It was an answer: how apply you this?"
    m:
      - "It’s an answer. How does it apply to us?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "The senators of Rome are this good belly,"
      - "And you the mutinous members; for examine"
      - "Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly"
      - "Touching the weal o’ the common, you shall find"
      - "No public benefit which you receive"
      - "But it proceeds or comes from them to you"
      - "And no way from yourselves. What do you think,"
      - "You, the great toe of this assembly?"
    m:
      - "The senators of Rome are this good belly, and you are the unhappy parts. Examine their decisions and their responsibilities, see how they relate to the common good, and you’ll find that there is no public benefit that you receive that doesn’t come from them to you. Nothing is being taken from you. What do you think, you, the great toe of this assembly?"

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "I the great toe! why the great toe?"
    m:
      - "I am the great toe? Why the great toe?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "For that, being one o’ the lowest, basest, poorest,"
      - "Of this most wise rebellion, thou go’st foremost:"
      - "Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,"
      - "Lead’st first to win some vantage."
      - "But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:"
      - "Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;"
      - "The one side must have bale."
    m:
      - "For the fact that you’re the leader of these ignorant rebels who are the lowest, basest, poorest of men. You’re like a stray dog that runs after whatever it can catch first. But prepare your sturdy bats and clubs: Rome and you, her rats, are at the point of battle. One side is going to lose."

  - os: "Enter CAIUS MARTIUS"
    ms: "CAIUS MARTIUS enters."

  - o:
      - "Hail, noble Martius!"
    m:
      - "Hail, noble Martius!"

  - sp: MARTIUS
    o:
      - "Thanks. What’s the matter, you dissentious rogues,"
      - "That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,"
      - "Make yourselves scabs?"
    m:
      - "Thanks. What’s the matter, you dissenting rebels? Are you make yourselves miserable by rubbing the minor itch of your opinion?"

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "We have ever your good word."
    m:
      - "You always speak kindly to us."

  - sp: MARTIUS
    o:
      - "He that will give good words to thee will flatter"
      - "Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,"
      - "That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,"
      - "The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,"
      - "Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;"
      - "Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,"
      - "Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,"
      - "Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is"
      - "To make him worthy whose offence subdues him"
      - "And curse that justice did it."
      - "Who deserves greatness"
      - "Deserves your hate; and your affections are"
      - "A sick man’s appetite, who desires most that"
      - "Which would increase his evil. He that depends"
      - "Upon your favours swims with fins of lead"
      - "And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?"
      - "With every minute you do change a mind,"
      - "And call him noble that was now your hate,"
      - "Him vile that was your garland. What’s the matter,"
      - "That in these several places of the city"
      - "You cry against the noble senate, who,"
      - "Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else"
      - "Would feed on one another? What’s their seeking?"
    m:
      - "Whoever speaks kindly to you flatters you undeservingly. What do you want, you dogs, who are satisfied by neither peace nor war? The one frightens you, and the other makes you self-righteous. Whoever trusts you sees you as lions, though he should see you as hares, and sees you as foxes, though he should see you as geese. You’re as unstable as a burning coal on ice or a hailstone in the sun. Your nature is to honor those who should be punished for their crimes and then to curse the justice that punishes him. He who deserves greatness deserves your scorn. Your instincts are perverted: you most desire the things that will make you sicker. He who depends on your approval swims with fins of lead and cuts down oaks with blades of grass. You should be hanged! Trust you? You change your mind every minute. You call the man you hated a moment ago “noble,” and you call the one you used to praise “vile.” Why do you cry against the noble Senate all around the city? Second only to the gods, they take care of you, you who would otherwise eat each other. What do the people want?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,"
      - "The city is well stored."
    m:
      - "They want to sell corn at their own rates. They say the city has plenty."

  - sp: MARTIUS
    o:
      - "Hang ’em! They say!"
      - "They’ll sit by the fire, and presume to know"
      - "What’s done i’ the Capitol; who’s like to rise,"
      - "Who thrives and who declines; side factions"
      - "and give out"
      - "Conjectural marriages; making parties strong"
      - "And feebling such as stand not in their liking"
      - "Below their cobbled shoes. They say there’s"
      - "grain enough!"
      - "Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,"
      - "And let me use my sword, I’ll make a quarry"
      - "With thousands of these quarter’d slaves, as high"
      - "As I could pick my lance."
    m:
      - "Hang them if that’s what they say! They’ll sit by the fire and presume to know what goes on in the capitol: who’s likely to rise, who thrives, and who declines. They’ll take sides with factions and make hasty alliances, making some groups strong and squashing those that they don’t like beneath their cheap shoes. They say there’s enough grain? If the nobility would stop taking pity on the poor and let me use my sword, I’d slaughter these thousands of slaves into a pile of pieces as high as I could throw my lance."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;"
      - "For though abundantly they lack discretion,"
      - "Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,"
      - "What says the other troop?"
    m:
      - "No, they’ve almost all calmed down. Even though they make a scene, they’re actually very cowardly. But tell me, what happened with the other group of rebels?"

  - sp: MARTIUS
    o:
      - "They are dissolved: hang ’em!"
      - "They said they were an-hungry; sigh’d forth proverbs,"
      - "That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,"
      - "That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not"
