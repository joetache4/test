Now, Thomas Mowbray, I will turn to you. Pay attention to this. I will prove that what I am about to say is true, either with my body here on earth or with my immortal soul in heaven. You are a traitor and a villain, born into too good a family to be so and too bad to live. The more beautiful the sky, the uglier the clouds look.

<p>The blood is hot that must be cool’d for this:</p>

<p>Don’t let my calm words cast doubt on my loyalty. I know that angry words will not settle this argument, so I’ll try to keep myself under control. But I can’t be so calm as to not say anything in my own defense. First, my respect for you, my king, prevents me from saying what I want and throwing those charges of treason right back at Bolingbroke. I defy him and spit on him as if he weren’t your relative, my lord. He’s a trash-talking coward and a villain, and I’d back up those charges in a duel, even if I gave him an advantage by handicapping myself. For now, I’ve defended my loyalty and made it known that he lies.</p>

<p>Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;</p>
<p>That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles</p>
<p>In name of lendings for your highness’ soldiers,</p>
<p>The which he hath detain’d for lewd employments,</p>
<p>Like a false traitor and injurious villain.</p>
<p>Besides I say and will in battle prove,</p>
<p>Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</p>
<p>That ever was survey’d by English eye,</p>
<p>That all the treasons for these eighteen years</p>
<p>Complotted and contrived in this land</p>
<p>Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</p>
<p>Further I say and further will maintain</p>
<p>Upon his bad life to make all this good,</p>
<p>That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester’s death,</p>
<p>Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</p>
<p>And consequently, like a traitor coward,</p>
<p>Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:</p>
<p>Which blood, like sacrificing Abel’s, cries,</p>
<p>Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</p>
<p>To me for justice and rough chastisement;</p>

<b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b>
<p>I’ll prove with my life that what I say is true. Mowbray has received eight thousand gold coins that he was supposed to pay to your soldiers as advances on their wages. But he’s used the money improperly, just like a traitor and harmful villain would. Even more, I declare and will prove in battle that all treasonous plots over the past eighteen years originated with Mowbray. And further, I know that he caused the death of the Duke of Gloucester by encouraging the duke’s easily influenced enemies, like any coward would, to slay the innocent duke. The duke was murdered like Abel, and his blood demands that I seek revenge and justice. By my own good name, I’ll inflict that justice on Mowbray or die trying.</p>

<p>Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais</p>
<p>Disbursed I duly to his highness’ soldiers;</p>
<p>The other part reserved I by consent,</p>
<p>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt</p>
<p>Upon remainder of a dear account,</p>
<p>Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:</p>
<p>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester’s death,</p>
<p>I slew him not; but to my own disgrace</p>
<p>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</p>
<p>For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</p>
<p>The honourable father to my foe</p>
<p>Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</p>
<p>A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul</p>
<p>But ere I last received the sacrament</p>
<p>I did confess it, and exactly begg’d</p>
<p>Your grace’s pardon, and I hope I had it.</p>

<b>THOMAS MOWBRAY</b>
<p>Then, Bolingbroke, you lie from your heart up through your false throat. I gave three quarters of the money I received to the king’s soldiers. The other quarter I had permission to keep, because I was owed the money for my service in going to fetch the queen from France. Now take back your lie. As for Gloucester, I didn’t kill him, but I admit I disgracefully neglected my duty. I once laid in wait to kill you, my noble lord of Lancaster, the father of my enemy. It was a terrible sin and troubles me greatly. But I confessed it already and specifically begged your pardon, and I hoped you had forgiven me. That is my fault. As for the rest of the charges, they come from a villain’s evil nature, and I’ll defend myself against this faithless and cowardly traitor. I’ll throw my glove down onto this arrogant traitor’s foot, and I’ll show that I’m loyal even compared to this member of the royal bloodline. I therefore pray that your highness will assign a day for our duel soon.</p>

<p>Even more than your uproar, it’s the fact that the Duke of Gloucester was my brother that makes me want to act against his murderers. But since it was Richard who was responsible for the murder in the first place and also controls how it will be avenged, I’ll have to trust in the will of heaven to bring justice to my brother’s killers.</p>

<p>Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?</p>
<p>Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?</p>
<p>Edward’s seven sons, whereof thyself art one,</p>

<p>Or seven fair branches springing from one root:</p>
<p>Some of those seven are dried by nature’s course,</p>
<p>Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;</p>
<p>But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,</p>

<p>One flourishing branch of his most royal root,</p>
<p>Is crack’d, and all the precious liquor spilt,</p>
<p>Is hack’d down, and his summer leaves all faded,</p>
<p>By envy’s hand and murder’s bloody axe.</p>
<p>Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,</p>
<p>That metal, that self-mould, that fashion’d thee</p>
<p>Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,</p>
<p>Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent</p>
<p>In some large measure to thy father’s death,</p>
<p>In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,</p>
<p>Who was the model of thy father’s life.</p>
<p>Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:</p>
<p>In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter’d,</p>
<p>Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,</p>
<p>Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:</p>
<p>That which in mean men we intitle patience</p>
<p>Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.</p>
<p>What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,</p>
<p>The best way is to venge my Gloucester’s death.</p>

<b>DUCHESS</b>
<p>Don’t you feel compelled to do more since he was your brother? Is there no passion in your love for him? Your father Edward treasured you and your six brothers. Some of you died natural deaths, and some of your lives were cut short. But Thomas, who was my love and one of Edward’s precious sons, is dead, killed by people who hated him. Oh, Gaunt, he was your own blood! The same mother and father who made you made him, and though you live and breathe, a part of you died with him. And because your father was the model for him, by watching him die you have in a sense consented to see your father die. You aren’t being patient. You’re giving up. In allowing your brother to be murdered, you have shown how you yourself might be killed. What we might call patience in common men is simply cowardice in noble men. What else can I say? The best way to protect your own life is to get revenge for Gloucester’s death.</p>

<p>Just one more word. When grief falls, it rises again, even though it is heavy and not light and empty. I’ve said goodbye before I said everything that I wanted to say. Give my respects to your brother, Edmund York. That’s all, but wait—don’t leave yet! I’ll think of something else. Tell him—what?—tell him to visit me at Plashy soon. Alas, what will he see there but empty servants’ quarters, bare walls, and floors that no one walks on? What will he hear as a welcome but my groans? So give my greetings, but don’t tell him to visit me there, since he can find sorrow easily enough elsewhere. I’ll go and die alone, and now I weep, having to finally say goodbye to you.</p>

<p>It’s a heavy sentence, my lord, and I didn’t expect to hear you say that. I deserved to be rewarded, not punished so harshly with exile. I’ll have to abandon my native English language, which I’ve spoken for forty years. My tongue will be of as little use as a broken violin. You’ve imprisoned it, and ignorance will be my jailer.

<p>No, he won’t listen—his ears are stuffed with all the sounds that make him happy, like the flattery and praise he receives, which wise men know to be wary of.

And he listens to the fashion reports from Italy, which England is always copying and always shamefully trying to catch up to. As long as it is new, no matter how awful it is, it instantly grabs Richard’s attention. His desire for all of these things doesn’t allow him to listen to good advice.

The king can’t go on living a wasteful lifestyle forever, in the same way that a raging fire will eventually burn itself out. Little rainstorms often go on for a long time, but big, violent thunderstorms come and go quickly. The person who starts off too fast will soon tire out, and the person who eats too fast will choke on his food. The hungry bird that can’t get enough to eat will soon eat itself. This kingdom, this majestic Earth, this paradise, this fortress that Nature built to protect herself against disease and war, this lucky race of people, this little world, this precious jewel of an island sitting in the sea—which protects it like a wall or a moat against the evil intentions of less fortunate countries—this blessed land, this England, this fertile mother of kings who are feared and famous for their Christian actions throughout the world, this land of such good people, this wonderful, wonderful land—it is now rented out, and I’m going to have to die watching it happen. England is surrounded by an ocean whose rocky shore has always pushed back the raging waters. Now, though, England is bound in shame by legal papers, made of rotting parchment and covered in inky blots, that were signed to rent it out. England, which is used to conquering other countries, has now shamefully conquered itself. Oh, how I wish this scandal would die and go away, just like I’m about to die. How happy my death would be then!</p>

<p>God have mercy! What a tide of troubles comes rushing over this land all at once! I don’t know what to do. I wish to God that the king had cut off my head when he cut off my brother’s.

<p>To show the world I am a gentleman.</p>

<b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b>
<p>Bring these men to me. Bushy and Green, I won’t torment your souls with too much talk of your wicked lives since your souls will soon leave your bodies. But so no one may claim your execution was murder, I will explain with these men as witnesses why you are legally sentenced to death. You have deceived a king, a man who was happy and attractive until you came along and changed him. Through your evil ways, you have driven a wedge between the king and the queen. You’ve interfered with their happy marriage and caused the queen suffering. I, by the luck of my birth, am a prince. I am closely related to the king, and until you changed his feelings toward me, he loved me. Because of your actions, I’ve had to live in exile in a foreign country, and meanwhile you lived off my wealth and property here, leasing my hunting grounds to others and cutting down my forests. You tore my family’s coat of arms out of the windows of my house and destroyed all signs of my family’s existence. If not for men’s opinions and the fact that I’m still alive, no one would ever know that the property was mine and that I am a member of the nobility. These crimes and at least twice as many more condemn you to death. <em>(Addressing the others.)</em> Make sure they are executed soon.</p>

So when this thief, this traitor Bolingbroke, who has been committing all these crimes during the nighttime, sees us coming up with the sun, he’ll be ashamed and will tremble at the light of day. All the water in an ocean can’t wash away a king’s right to the throne. Mere mortals can’t get rid of someone who has been appointed by God. For every solider Bolingbroke has enlisted to fight against me, God has given me an angel. And when angels fight, the weak men fall, since heaven always guards those who are right.</p>

<p>My ears are open, and my heart is ready. The worst you can tell me about are losses for me here on earth. So, did I lose my kingdom? It was my problem, and what loss is it to be rid of a problem? Is Bolingbroke still trying to overthrow me? If he serves God, we will serve God, too, and then the two of us will be merely equals. Are our subjects revolting? We can’t fix that. They break their faith with God as well as with us. Though you may cry out about woe, destruction, ruin, and decay, death is the worst fate of all, and the time for death will come.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter where he is. Let’s not try to cheer ourselves up. We must talk about graves and worms and epitaphs. We’ll make the dust our paper and use our tears to write a message of sorrow on the earth. Let’s choose our executors and talk of wills. And, yet, what can we bequeath to anyone other than leaving our rotting bodies to the ground? Our lands and our lives now belong to Bolingbroke, and we can call nothing our own except for our deaths and that little patch of earth that will cover our buried bodies. For God’s sake, let’s sit on the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings, how some were overthrown and others killed in war. Some were haunted by the ghosts of the kings they had overthrown. Still others were poisoned by their wives, while others were killed in their sleep. All of them, however, were murdered. There is always death around kings, and there’s no way to escape it. Death laughs at the king’s reign and mocks his great ceremonies, allowing him to live a little while and play the monarch. Death fills him with pride as if the king’s body were immortal, and at the end death comes and with little effort kills the body. Then goodbye, king! So stop treating me so respectfully. There’s no need to pretend that I am any different than you. You’ve been wrong about me all this time. I feel all the same things that you do. I have desires and feel sad and need friends, just like you. How, then, can you say that I’m a king?</p>

<p>since I thought I was still your lawful king. And if I am, how dare you not kneel in my presence? If I am not, prove to me that God has dismissed me from my position. No mortal man, after all, can take away my scepter, unless he steals it or usurps it against the will of God. Even if you think that, like you, everyone has put their souls in danger by turning away from me, and that I have no friends, you should know that God, my master, is gathering disease and agony in his clouds on my behalf. They will strike the unborn children of anyone who raises their hands against me and the glory of my crown. Tell Bolingbroke—for I think he’s standing over there—that every step he takes on my land is a dangerous act of treason. He has come to wage war against me. But ten thousand sons will die, faithful Englishman’s blood will stain the pastures, and peace will turn to anger before he ever gets the crown he seeks.</p>

<p>Forgive me, madam. I’m not happy to say it, but it’s true. Bolingbroke has captured King Richard. Their fortunes are being weighed out. Your lord has only himself and his vanity, which makes him lighter. Great Bolingbroke has all the English peers with him, and that gives him greater weight than King Richard. If you hurry to London, you’ll see. I’m only saying what everyone knows.</p>

Shall the image of God’s majesty, who is His chosen deputy and caretaker and has been so for many years, be judged by his inferiors without even being present? Oh, God, don’t allow such refined souls in a Christian land to be so obscene. I’m speaking to subjects as a subject, because I’ve been moved by God to speak boldly for his king. You might call my Lord of Hereford here king, but he is a traitor to his king. If you give him the crown, I predict that the blood of the English will soak the soil, and future generations will regret this act. Peace will leave England and go to the Turks and infidels, while we will have terrible wars that will pit families against each other. Disorder, fear, mutiny, and horror will live here, and it will be known as a place of terror and skulls.

<p>A king of beasts, indeed. If only they weren’t beasts, I would still be a happy king of men. Good former queen, get ready to go to France. Think of me as dead, and say goodbye to me now as if I were on my deathbed. Through long winter nights sit by the fire with good people and let them tell you stories of sad times long ago. And before you say good night, tell them my sadder story and send them weeping to their beds. Even the firewood will sympathize and cry out their fires. And some will be so unhappy at the story of the overthrow of a rightful king that they will cover themselves in ashes.</p>

<b>KING RICHARD II</b>
<p>I have been studying how I may compare</p>
<p>This prison where I live unto the world:</p>
<p>And for because the world is populous</p>
<p>And here is not a creature but myself,</p>
<p>I cannot do it; yet I’ll hammer it out.</p>
<p>My brain I’ll prove the female to my soul,</p>
<p>My soul the father; and these two beget</p>
<p>A generation of still-breeding thoughts,</p>
<p>And these same thoughts people this little world,</p>
<p>In humours like the people of this world,</p>
<p>For no thought is contented. The better sort,</p>
<p>As thoughts of things divine, are intermix’d</p>
<p>With scruples and do set the word itself</p>
<p>Against the word:</p>
<p>As thus, “Come, little ones,” and then again,</p>
<p>“It is as hard to come as for a camel</p>
<p>To thread the postern of a small needle’s eye.”</p>
<p>Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</p>
<p>Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails</p>
<p>May tear a passage through the flinty ribs</p>
<p>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,</p>
<p>And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.</p>
<p>Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</p>
<p>That they are not the first of fortune’s slaves,</p>
<p>Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars</p>
<p>Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</p>
<p>That many have and others must sit there;</p>
<p>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</p>
<p>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</p>
<p>Of such as have before endured the like.</p>
<p>Thus play I in one person many people,</p>
<p>And none contented: sometimes am I king;</p>
<p>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</p>
<p>And so I am: then crushing penury</p>
<p>Persuades me I was better when a king;</p>
<p>Then am I king’d again: and by and by</p>
<p>Think that I am unking’d by Bolingbroke,</p>
<p>And straight am nothing: but whate’er I be,</p>
<p>Nor I nor any man that but man is</p>
<p>With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased</p>
<p>With being nothing. Music do I hear?</p>

<b>KING RICHARD II</b>
<p>I have been thinking about how I might compare this prison I live in to the world. But because the world is full of people and I’m the only one here, I cannot do it. Yet I’ll work it out. My brain and my soul will produce enough thoughts to fill this little world, like people in the outside world and just as discontented. The better kind of thought, like the thought of divine things, is mixed with doubts and compares passages from scripture, like “Come, little ones” and “It is as hard for a rich man to enter heaven as for a camel to pass through a needle’s eye.”Ambitious thoughts plot unlikely miracles, such as digging through the walls of my cell by hand, and these thoughts die in their prime because they are futile. Contented thoughts tell themselves that they aren’t the first to be a slave to fortune, and they won’t be the last. They’re like beggars in the stocks who take comfort in the fact that others have already sat there and more will sit there. So I host many people inside my own head, and none are content. Sometimes I’m king, and then some treason makes me wish I was a beggar, and so then I am a beggar. Then terrible poverty persuades me that I was better off as king, so then I am king again. And then I think that I have been dethroned by Bolingbroke, and suddenly I’m nothing. But whatever I am, just like all men, I’ll never be happy until I am dead and nothing at all. Do I hear music?</p>

<p>Ha! Keep time. How awful music is when they don’t keep time and the notes’ proportions are ruined. It’s the same thing in men’s lives. And here I can chastise the poor time kept on an out-of-tune instrument, when in the harmony of my government and life I couldn’t hear my own time breaking. I wasted time then, and now time wastes me. Time has made me his clock: my thoughts have become minutes that turn the clock hands in my eyes, and my finger is the dial that wipes away my tears. Now, sir, my groans are like the sounds that toll the hours, and they’re made by striking my heart, which is the bell. Thus my sighs, tears, and groans signify minutes and hours. Meanwhile, my time speeds on as Bolingbroke has his joy, and I’m left here playing the clock for him. This music makes me crazy. Let it stop. It might make madmen sane, but for me, it makes a wise man mad. Yet bless the heart that plays it for me! It’s a sign of love, and I am seldom given love in this hateful world.</p>
