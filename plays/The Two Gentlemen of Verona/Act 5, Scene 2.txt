    ms: "THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA enter. JULIA is disguised in the clothing of a male servant."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "Sir Proteus, what says Sylvia to my suit?"
    m:
      - "Sir Proteus, what does Sylvia have to say about my declarations of love for her?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "O, sir, I find her milder than she was,"
      - "And yet she takes exceptions at your person."
    m:
      - "Oh, sir, she’s not as cold as she used to be, though she still objects to you."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "What, that my leg is too long?"
    m:
      - "What, because my leg is too long?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "No, that it is too little."
    m:
      - "No, because it’s too skinny."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "I’ll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder."
    m:
      - "I’ll wear a boot with spurs, then, to make it look thicker."

  - sp: JULIA
    o:
      - "*(aside)* But love will not be spurred to what it loathes."
    m:
      - "*(aside)* But love can’t be spurred to like what it hates."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "What says she to my face?"
    m:
      - "What does she have to say about my face?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "She says it is a fair one."
    m:
      - "She says it is an attractive one."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "Nay, then, the wanton lies; my face is black."
    m:
      - "No, then, she’s lying—my face is ugly."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "But pearls are fair, and the old saying is,"
      - "Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies’ eyes."
    m:
      - "But pearls are beautiful, and the old saying is that ugly men are pearls in beautiful women’s eyes."

  - sp: JULIA
    o:
      - "*(aside)* ’Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies’ eyes,"
      - "For I had rather wink than look on them."
    m:
      - "*(aside)* It’s true—the kind of pearls that make ladies go blind. I’d rather shut my eyes than look at them."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "How likes she my discourse?"
    m:
      - "How does she like my conversation?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Ill, when you talk of war."
    m:
      - "Not much, when you talk about war."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "But well when I discourse of love and peace?"
    m:
      - "But she likes it when I talk about love and peace?"

  - sp: JULIA
    o:
      - "*(aside)* But better, indeed, when you hold your peace."
    m:
      - "*(aside)* But even better when you hold your peace and don’t talk at all."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "What says she to my valor?"
    m:
      - "What does she have to say about my bravery?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "O, sir, she makes no doubt of that."
    m:
      - "Oh, sir, she doesn’t question it at all."

  - sp: JULIA
    o:
      - "*(aside)* She needs not, when she knows it cowardice."
    m:
      - "*(aside)* She doesn’t need to, since she knows he’s a coward."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "What says she to my birth?"
    m:
      - "What does she have to say about my lineage?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "That you are well derived."
    m:

  - sp: JULIA
    o:

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "Considers she my possessions?"
    m:
      - "Has she thought about all the lands that I own?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "O, ay, and pities them."
    m:
      - "Oh, yes, and she pities them."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "Wherefore?"
    m:
      - "Why?"

  - sp: JULIA
    o:
      - "*(aside)* That such an ass should owe them."
    m:
      - "*(aside)* Because an ass like him owns them."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "That they are out by lease."
    m:
      - "Because you’ve leased them to others."

  - os: "Enter DUKE"
    ms: "The DUKE enters."

  - sp: JULIA
    o:
      - "Here comes the Duke."
    m:
      - "Here comes the duke."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "How now, Sir Proteus? how now, Thurio?"
      - "Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?"
    m:
      - "How are you, Sir Proteus? How are you, Thurio? Has either of you seen Eglamour lately?"

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "Not I."
    m:
      - "I haven’t."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Nor I."
    m:
      - "Nor have I."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Saw you my daughter?"
    m:
      - "Have you seen my daughter?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Neither."
    m:
      - "I haven’t seen her either."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Why then,"
      - "She’s fled unto that peasant Valentine,"
      - "And Eglamour is in her company."
      - "’Tis true, for Friar Lawrence met them both"
      - "As he in penance wandered through the forest."
      - "Him he knew well, and guessed that it was she,"
      - "But, being masked, he was not sure of it."
      - "Besides, she did intend confession"
      - "At Patrick’s cell this even, and there she was not."
      - "These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence."
      - "Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,"
      - "But mount you presently, and meet with me"
      - "Upon the rising of the mountain foot"
      - "That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled."
      - "Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me."
    m:
      - "That means she’s run off to that rascal Valentine, and Eglamour is with her. I know it’s true, because Friar Lawrence met them both as he wandered through the forest in penance. He knew Eglamour well and guessed that the girl was Sylvia, but he wasn’t sure since she had a mask on. Besides, she’d planned to take confession at Friar Patrick’s chamber tonight, but she didn’t show up. These coincidences confirm that she’s run away. Therefore, I beg you, stop talking and mount your horses immediately. Meet me on the rise at the foot of the mountain that leads toward Mantua, where they fled to. Hurry, kind gentlemen, and follow me."

  - os: "Exit DUKE"
    ms: "The DUKE exits."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,"
      - "That flies her fortune when it follows her."
      - "I’ll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour"
      - "Than for the love of reckless Sylvia."
    m:
      - "Why, what a silly girl she is to throw away everything good that was coming to her. I’ll follow them, more to get revenge on Eglamour than out of love for reckless Sylvia."

  - os: "Exit THURIO"
    ms: "THURIO exits."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "And I will follow, more for Sylvia’s love"
      - "Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her."
    m:
      - "And I’ll follow, too, more out of love for Sylvia than hatred of Elgamour, who goes with her."

  - os: "Exit PROTEUS"
    ms: "PROTEUS exits."

  - sp: JULIA
    o:
      - "And I will follow, more to cross that love"
      - "Than hate for Sylvia, that is gone for love."
    m:
      - "And I will follow as well, more to thwart Proteus’ love for Sylvia than out of any hatred of Sylvia, who flees because of love."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "Exit."
