<p>He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not.</p>
<p>The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.—</p>
<p>I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,</p>
<p>By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,</p>
<p>By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,</p>
<p>And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,</p>
<p>That in thy likeness thou appear to us.</p>

<b>MERCUTIO</b>
<p>I’ll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit. Romeo! Madman! Passion! Lover! Show yourself in the form of a sigh. Speak one rhyme, and I’ll be satisfied. Just cry out, “Ah me!” Just say “love” and “dove.” Say just one lovely word to my good friend Venus. Just say the nickname of her blind son Cupid, the one who shot arrows so well in the old story.—Romeo doesn’t hear me. He doesn’t stir. He doesn’t move. The silly ape is dead, but I must make him appear.—I summon you by Rosaline’s bright eyes, by her high forehead and her red lips, by her fine feet, by her straight legs, by her trembling thighs, and by the regions right next to her thighs. In the name of all of these things, I command you to appear before us in your true form.</p>

<p>This cannot anger him. ’Twould anger him</p>
<p>To raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle</p>
<p>Of some strange nature, letting it there stand</p>
<p>Till she had laid it and conjured it down.</p>
<p>That were some spite. My invocation</p>
<p>Is fair and honest. In his mistress’ name</p>
<p>I conjure only but to raise up him.</p>

<p>What I’m saying can’t anger him. He would be angry if I summoned a strange spirit for her to have sex with—that’s what would make him angry. The things I’m saying are fair and honest. All I’m doing is saying the name of the woman he loves to lure him out of the darkness.</p>

<p>O Romeo, that she were! Oh, that she were</p>
<p>An open arse, and thou a poperin pear.</p>

<p>If love is blind, it can’t hit the target. Now he’ll sit under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were one of those fruits that look like female genitalia. Oh Romeo, I wish she <em>were</em> an open-arse, and you a Popperin pear to “pop her in.” Good night, Romeo. I’ll go to my little trundle bed. This open field is too cold a place for me to sleep. <em>(to BENVOLIO)</em> Come on, should we go?</p>
