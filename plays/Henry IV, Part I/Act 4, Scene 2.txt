    o:
      - "Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry. Fill me a bottle of sack. Our soldiers shall march through. We’ll to Sutton Coldfield tonight."
    m:
      - "Bardolph, go ahead of us to Coventry, and fill me a bottle of wine. Our army will keep marching, and we’ll make it to Sutton Coldfield tonight."

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "Will you give me money, captain?"
    m:

    m:
      - "Well, if this bottle earns you an angel, then keep it for your troubles. If you earn twenty angels, then keep them all; I’m good for it. Tell my lieutenant Peto to meet me at the city limit."

      - "If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused gurnet. I have misused the King’s press damnably. I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me none but good householders, yeomen’s sons; inquire me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves—as had as lief hear the devil as a drum, such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck. I pressed me none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins’ heads, and they have bought out their services, and now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of companies—slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth, where the glutton’s dogs licked his sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but discarded, unjust servingmen, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters, and ostlers tradefallen, the cankers of a calm world and a long peace, ten times more dishonorable-ragged than an old feazed ancient; and such have I to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services, that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I’ll not march through Coventry with them, that’s flat. Nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of prison. There’s not a shirt and a half in all my company, and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald’s coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Albans or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that’s all one; they’ll find linen enough on every hedge."
    m:
      - "If I’m not ashamed of my soldiers, then I’m a pickled fish. I’ve taken terrible advantage of my position. I’ve pressed a hundred and fifty soldiers into service, and for that, the treasury has paid me over three hundred pounds. I recruited only well-to-do property owners and rich farmer’s sons. I looked for men who were engaged to be married, who were already halfway through their preparations. I found a whole supply of pampered cowards who would rather listen to the devil than a military march; who feared the sound of gunfire more than a wounded bird or a maimed duck might. I recruited only the soft-hearted, who each had as much courage as could fit on a pin head and bribed me to avoid fighting. So now, my battalion is made up of flag bearers, corporals, lieutenants, and crooks as ragged as Lazarus in those paintings where the dogs are licking the sores on his body. I have men who’ve never been soldiers: servants dismissed for their dishonesty; youngest sons with no hope of an inheritance; runaway apprentice bartenders; unemployed stable boys. When the world is calm and peaceful, these men are blisters on society. They’re ten times more ragged than an old, tattered flag, and they’re the kind of men I have to replace the ones who bribed me. You’d think I had a hundred and fifty men who’d just come from pig farming, who eat scraps and garbage. One madman saw us on the march and told me that it looked as if I’d unloaded all the gallows and drafted all the dead bodies. No one’s ever seen such a group of scarecrows. I’m not going to march through Coventry with them tonight, that’s for sure. They march with their legs wide apart, as though they had chains on their ankles. Which makes sense, since I drafted most of them out of jails. There’s only a shirt and a half in the whole group, and the half-shirt is really just two napkins sewn together and thrown over the shoulders like a cape. And the whole shirt, to tell the truth, was stolen from a tavern owner in St. Alban’s, or maybe that drunken innkeeper in Daventry. But that doesn’t matter. They’ll be able to steal plenty of clothing from the hedges, where the washers hang the laundry out to dry."

    ms: "PRINCE HENRY and Lord WESTMORELAND enter."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "How now, blown Jack? How now, quilt?"
    m:
      - "What’s up, swollen Jack! What’s up, quilt?"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "What, Hal, how now, mad wag? What a devil dost thou in Warwickshire?—My good Lord of Westmoreland, I cry you mercy: I thought your Honor had already been at Shrewsbury."
    m:
      - "Hello there, Hal, you crazy boy! What in the devil’s name are you doing in Warwickshire? And Lord Westmoreland, I beg your pardon. I thought you were already at Shrewsbury."

  - sp: WESTMORELAND
    o:
      - "Faith, Sir John,’tis more than time that I were there and you too, but my powers are there already. The King, I can tell you, looks for us all. We must away all night."
    m:
      - "You’re right, Sir John; it’s about time I got there, and you, too. But my army’s already there. The King is waiting for us, so we must march all night."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Tut, never fear me. I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream."
    m:
      - "Don’t worry about me. I’m as focused as a cat looking for cream to steal."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "I think to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose fellows are these that come after?"
    m:
      - "Steal cream is right—you’ve stolen so much that it’s turned you into butter. But tell me, Jack, whose soldiers are those?"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Mine, Hal, mine."
    m:
      - "Mine, Hal, mine."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "I did never see such pitiful rascals."
    m:
      - "I never saw such pitiful-looking losers."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Tut, tut, good enough to toss; food for powder, food for powder. They’ll fill a pit as well as better. Tush, man, mortal men, mortal men."
    m:
      - "Now, now: they’re good enough to die. Cannon fodder, cannon fodder—they’ll fill a mass grave as well as better men would. They’re just men, just men."

  - sp: WESTMORELAND
    o:
      - "Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor and bare, too beggarly."
    m:
      - "Maybe so, Sir John, but I think they look terribly poor and bare; they look like beggars."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had that, and for their bareness, I am sure they never learned that of me."
    m:
      - "Well, I don’t know where they got their poverty, but their bareness—or their bare-bonedness—well, they didn’t get that from me."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "No, I’ll be sworn, unless you call three fingers in the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste. Percy is already in the field."
    m:
      - "That’s for sure. Unless you think several inches of fat over your ribs makes you “bare-boned.” But hurry up, sirrah: Percy is already at the battlefield."

  - os: "Exit PRINCE."
    ms: "PERCY exits."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "What, is the King encamped?"
    m:
      - "What, has the King already made camp?"

  - sp: WESTMORELAND
    o:
      - "He is, Sir John. I fear we shall stay too long."
    m:
      - "He has, Sir John: I’m afraid we may be too late."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "  Well,"
      - "To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast"
      - "Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest."
    m:
      - "Well, a hungry guest arrives early for a feast, but a poor soldier arrives late to a battle."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
