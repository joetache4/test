<p>The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the</p>

<p>Go then, find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the</p>
<p>Count Claudio alone. Tell them that you know that Hero</p>
<p>loves me. Intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and</p>
<p>Claudio, as in love of your brother’s honor, who hath made</p>
<p>this match, and his friend’s reputation, who is thus like to</p>
<p>be cozened with the semblance of a maid, that you have</p>
<p>discovered thus. They will scarcely believe this without</p>
<p>trial. Offer them instances, which shall bear no less</p>
<p>likelihood than to see me at her chamber window, hear me</p>
<p>call Margaret “Hero,” hear Margaret term me “Claudio,”</p>
<p>and bring them to see this the very night before the</p>
<p>intended wedding, for in the meantime I will so fashion the</p>
<p>matter that Hero shall be absent, and there shall appear</p>
<p>such seeming truth of Hero’s disloyalty that jealousy shall</p>
<p>be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>BORACHIO</b>
<p>Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone. Tell them you know that Hero loves me. Pretend to be very concerned about both the Prince, who has compromised his honor by making the match, and Claudio, whose reputation will be ruined by this woman who’s pretending to be a virgin. Of course, they won’t believe you without proof. Tell them you’ve seen the two of us at Hero’s bedroom window, and then bring them to see for themselves on the night before the wedding. I’ll arrange it so that Hero is away for the night, so what they’ll actually see is Margaret and me at the window, calling each other “Hero” and “Claudio.” It’ll be such blatant evidence of Hero’s disloyalty that Claudio’s jealousy will quickly turn to certainty, and the wedding will be instantly called off.</p>
