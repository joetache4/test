  - os: "Enter LADY MACDUFF, her SON, and ROSS"
    ms: "LADY MACDUFF, her SON, and ROSS enter."

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "What had he done to make him fly the land?"
    m:
      - "What did he do that made him flee this land?"

  - sp: ROSS
    o:
      - "You must have patience, madam."
    m:
      - "You have to be patient, madam."

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "    He had none."
      - "His flight was madness. When our actions do not,"
      - "Our fears do make us traitors."
    m:
      - "He had no patience. He was crazy to run away. Even if you’re not a traitor, you’re going to look like one if you run away."

  - sp: ROSS
    o:
      - "    You know not"
      - "Whether it was his wisdom or his fear."
    m:
      - "You don’t know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee."

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Wisdom! To leave his wife, to leave his babes,"
      - "His mansion and his titles in a place"
      - "From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;"
      - "He wants the natural touch. For the poor wren,"
      - "The most diminutive of birds, will fight,"
      - "Her young ones in her nest, against the owl."
      - "All is the fear and nothing is the love,"
      - "As little is the wisdom, where the flight"
      - "So runs against all reason."
    m:
      - "How could it be wisdom! To leave his wife, his children, his house, and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it! He doesn’t love us. He lacks the natural instinct to protect his family. Even the fragile wren, the smallest of birds, will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest. His running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love. And since it’s so unreasonable for him to run away, it has nothing to do with wisdom either."

  - sp: ROSS
    o:
      - "    My dearest coz,"
      - "I pray you school yourself. But for your husband,"
      - "He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows"
      - "The fits o’ th’ season. I dare not speak much further;"
      - "But cruel are the times when we are traitors"
      - "And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor"
      - "From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,"
      - "But float upon a wild and violent sea"
      - "Each way and none. I take my leave of you."
      - "Shall not be long but I’ll be here again."
      - "Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward"
      - "To what they were before.—My pretty cousin,"
      - "Blessing upon you."
    m:
      - "My dearest relative, I’m begging you, pull yourself together. As for your husband, he is noble, wise, and judicious, and he understands what the times require. It’s not safe for me to say much more than this, but times are bad when people get denounced as traitors and don’t even know why. In times like these, we believe frightening rumors but we don’t even know what we’re afraid of. It’s like being tossed around on the ocean in every direction, and finally getting nowhere. I’ll say good-bye now. It won’t be long before I’m back. When things are at their worst they have to stop, or else improve to the way things were before. My young cousin, I put my blessing upon you."

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Fathered he is, and yet he’s fatherless."
    m:
      - "He has a father, and yet he is fatherless."

  - sp: ROSS
    o:
      - "I am so much a fool, should I stay longer"
      - "It would be my disgrace and your discomfort."
      - "I take my leave at once."
    m:
      - "I have to go. If I stay longer, I’ll embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying. I’m leaving now."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "ROSS exits."

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "    Sirrah, your father’s dead."
      - "And what will you do now? How will you live?"
    m:
      - "Young man, your father’s dead. What are you going to do now? How are you going to live?"

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "As birds do, Mother."
    m:
      - "I will live the way birds do, Mother."

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "What, with worms and flies?"
    m:
      - "What? Are you going to start eating worms and flies?"

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "With what I get, I mean, and so do they."
    m:
      - "I mean I will live on whatever I get, like birds do."

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Poor bird! Thou ’dst never fear the net nor lime,"
      - "The pitfall nor the gin."
    m:
      - "You’d be a pitiful bird. You wouldn’t know enough to be afraid of traps."

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for."
      - "My father is not dead, for all your saying."
    m:
      - "Why should I be afraid of them, Mother? If I’m a pitiful bird, like you say, hunters won’t want me. No matter what you say, my father is not dead."

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for a father?"
    m:
      - "Yes, he is dead. What are you going to do for a father?"

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "Nay, how will you do for a husband?"
    m:
      - "Maybe you should ask, what will you do for a husband?"

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Why, I can buy me twenty at any market."
    m:
      - "Oh, I can buy twenty husbands at any market."

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "Then you’ll buy ’em to sell again."
    m:
      - "If so, you’d be buying them to sell again."

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Thou speak’st with all thy wit; and yet, i’ faith,"
      - "With wit enough for thee."
    m:
      - "You talk like a child, but you’re very smart anyway."

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "Was my father a traitor, Mother?"
    m:
      - "Was my father a traitor, Mother?"

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Ay, that he was."
    m:
      - "Yes, he was."

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "What is a traitor?"
    m:
      - "What is a traitor?"

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Why, one that swears and lies."
    m:
      - "Someone who makes a promise and breaks it."

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "And be all traitors that do so?"
    m:
      - "And is everyone who swears and lies a traitor?"

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged."
    m:
      - "Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged."

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?"
    m:
      - "And should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged?"

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Every one."
    m:
      - "Everyone."

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "Who must hang them?"
    m:
      - "Who should hang them?"

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Why, the honest men."
    m:
      - "The honest men."

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them."
    m:
      - "Then the liars are fools, for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them."

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father?"
    m:
      - "*(laughing)* Heaven help you for saying that, boy! *(sad again)* But what will you do without a father?"

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "If he were dead, you’d weep for him. If you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father."
    m:
      - "If he were dead, you’d be weeping for him. If you aren’t weeping, it’s a good sign that I’ll soon have a new father."

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!"
    m:
      - "Silly babbler, how you talk!"

  - os: "Enter a MESSENGER"
    ms: "A MESSENGER enters."

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,"
      - "Though in your state of honor I am perfect."
      - "I doubt some danger does approach you nearly."
      - "If you will take a homely man’s advice,"
      - "Be not found here. Hence with your little ones."
      - "To fright you thus methinks I am too savage;"
      - "To do worse to you were fell cruelty,"
      - "Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!"
      - "I dare abide no longer."
    m:
      - "Bless you, fair lady! You don’t know me, but I know you’re an important person. I’m afraid something dangerous is coming toward you. If you’ll take a simple man’s advice, don’t be here when it arrives. Go away and take your children. I feel bad for scaring you like this, but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm. And harm is getting close! Heaven keep you safe!"

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "The MESSENGER exits."

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "Whither should I fly?"
      - "I have done no harm. But I remember now"
      - "I am in this earthly world, where to do harm"
      - "Is often laudable, to do good sometime"
      - "Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,"
      - "Do I put up that womanly defense,"
      - "To say I have done no harm?"
    m:
      - "Where should I go? I haven’t done anything wrong. But I have to remember that I’m here on Earth, where doing evil is often praised, and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake. So then why should I offer this womanish defense that I’m innocent?"

  - os: "Enter MURDERERS"
    ms: "The MURDERERS enter."

  - o:
      - "    What are these faces?"
    m:

  - sp: FIRST MURDERER
    o:
      - "Where is your husband?"
    m:
      - "Where is your husband?"

  - sp: LADY MACDUFF
    o:
      - "I hope, in no place so unsanctified"
      - "Where such as thou mayst find him."
    m:
      - "I hope he’s not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him."

  - sp: FIRST MURDERER
    o:
      - "    He’s a traitor."
    m:
      - "He’s a traitor."

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "Thou liest, thou shag-haired villain!"
    m:
      - "You’re lying, you shaggy-haired villain!"

  - sp: FIRST MURDERER
    o:
      - "    *(Stabbing him)*     What, you egg? Young fry of treachery!"
    m:
      - "What’s that, you runt? *(stabbing him)* Young son of a traitor!"

  - sp: SON
    o:
      - "He has killed me, mother."
      - "Run away, I pray you!"
    m:
      - "He has killed me, Mother. Run away, I beg you!"

  - os: "He dies. Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying “Murder!” followed by MURDERERS"
    ms: "The SON dies. LADY MACDUFF exits, crying “Murder!” The MURDERERS exit, following her."
