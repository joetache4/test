  - os: "Enter TRANIO as LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO as LITIO"
    ms: "TRANIO enters, disguised as LUCENTIO, accompanied by HORTENSIO, disguised as LITIO."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)*"
      - "Is ’t possible, friend Litio, that mistress Bianca"
      - "Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?"
      - "I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand."
    m:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* I don’t believe it, Litio. It’s not possible that Bianca could prefer another man to me. I’ve seen the way she behaves."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "*(as LITIO)* Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,"
      - "Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching."
      - "*They stand aside*"
    m:
      - "*(as LITIO)* You want proof of what I’m telling you? Stand right here and watch this fellow’s “lesson.” *(they stand off to one side)*"

  - os: "Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO"
    ms: "BIANCA enters with LUCENTIO disguised as CAMBIO."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "*(as CAMBIO)* Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?"
    m:
      - "*(as CAMBIO)* Well, mistress, are you learning from what you’re reading?"

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "What, master, read you? First resolve me that."
    m:
      - "What are you reading, teacher? Answer me that first."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "*(as CAMBIO)* I read that I profess, *The Art to Love.*"
    m:
      - "*(as CAMBIO)* I’m reading the book I know best—*The Art of Love*"

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "And may you prove, sir, master of your art."
    m:
      - "I hope you’re an expert in your field."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "*(as CAMBIO)* While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!"
    m:
      - "*(as CAMBIO)* Well, my dear, you’re the mistress of my heart in any case!"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "*(as LITIO)* Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,"
      - "You that durst swear that your mistress Bianca"
      - "Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio."
    m:
      - "*(as LITIO)* Quick work for schoolwork! How do you explain that? I though you said your precious Bianca loved no one better than you, Lucentio!"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* O despiteful love! Unconstant womankind!"
      - "I tell thee, Litio, this is wonderful!"
    m:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Oh spiteful love! Faithless womanhood! It’s incredible, Litio!"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Mistake no more. I am not Litio,"
      - "Nor a musician as I seem to be,"
      - "But one that scorn to live in this disguise"
      - "For such a one as leaves a gentlema"
      - "And makes a god of such a cullion."
      - "Know, sir, that I am called Hortensio."
    m:
      - "Let me come clean. I’m not really Litio. I’m not even a musician, really. In fact, I refuse to go on with this charade for a woman who would choose a lower-class guy like this over a gentleman of my stature. My name is Hortensio, sir."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Signior Hortensio, I have often heard"
      - "Of your entire affection to Bianca,"
      - "And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,"
      - "I will with you, if you be so contented,"
      - "Forswear Bianca and her love for ever."
    m:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Signior Hortensio, I’ve often heard of your total devotion to Bianca. So, now that I’ve seen with my own eyes proof of her worthlessness, I’m willing to join you in swearing her off for good, if you like."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "See how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,"
      - "Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow"
      - "Never to woo her more, but do forswear her"
      - "As one unworthy all the former favors"
      - "That I have fondly flattered her withal."
    m:
      - "Look how they kiss and carry on! Signior Lucentio, it’s a deal. I hereby swear to have nothing more to do with this girl. I formally declare her unworthy of all the attention and expense I have wasted on her."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "And here I take the like unfeignèd oath"
      - "Never to marry with her, though she would entreat."
      - "Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him!"
    m:
      - "And I hereby make the same promise—never to marry her, not even if she begs me. The hell with her! Look how she carries on with him! It’s revolting!"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!"
      - "For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,"
      - "I will be married to a wealthy widow,"
      - "Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me"
      - "As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard."
      - "And so farewell, Signior Lucentio."
      - "Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,"
      - "Shall win my love, and so I take my leave,"
      - "In resolution as I swore before."
    m:
      - "I wish all her lovers had given her up. Well, to be on the safe side—so I don’t go back on my promise—I plan to get myself married to a wealthy widow within the next three days. She’s been after me for years—the way I’ve been for this proud, haughty hag. Farewell, then, Signior Lucentio. From now on, goodness in women, not superficial beauty, will win my heart. I bid you all goodbye. I’ve made up my mind, and I’m going to stick to it."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace"
      - "As ’longeth to a lover’s blessèd case!"
      - "Nay, I have ta’en you napping, gentle love,"
      - "And have forsworn you with Hortensio."
    m:
      - "Miss Bianca, may you be blessed with all the happiness you deserve. No, I’ve caught you out, my dear. You’re busted. Hortensio and I have given you up."

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "Tranio, you jest. But have you both forsworn me?"
    m:
      - "You can’t mean it, Tranio! Have you both really given me up?"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "Mistress, we have."
    m:
      - "Yes, ma’am, we have."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "  Then we are rid of Litio."
    m:
      - "So Litio’s out of the picture."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "I’ faith, he’ll have a lusty widow now"
      - "That shall be wooed and wedded in a day."
    m:
      - "He’s going after a young widow. He says he’ll court and win her in a day."

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "God give him joy!"
    m:
      - "Well, good for him!"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "Ay, and he’ll tame her."
    m:
      - "Yeah, and he’s going to tame her."

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "He says so, Tranio?"
    m:
      - "Is that what he says?"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "Faith, he is gone unto the taming school."
    m:
      - "Yep. He’s gone to study at the taming school."

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "The taming school? What, is there such a place?"
    m:
      - "The taming school? Is there such a place?"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master,"
      - "That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long"
      - "To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue."
    m:
      - "Yes, ma’am. Petruchio runs it. There he teaches piles of tricks for taming a shrew *and* her tongue."

  - os: "Enter BIONDELLO"
    ms: "BIONDELLO enters."

  - sp: BIONDELLO
    o:
      - "O master, master, I have watched so long"
      - "That I am dog-weary, but at last I spied"
      - "An ancient angel coming down the hill"
      - "Will serve the turn."
    m:
      - "Master, master, I’ve been on the lookout so long, I’m ready to fall down dead—but I’ve got one, finally! There’s a trustworthy old fellow coming down the hill who will do the job."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "    What is he, Biondello?"
    m:
      - "What does he look like, Biondello?"

  - sp: BIONDELLO
    o:
      - "Master, a marcantant, or a pedant,"
      - "I know not what, but formal in apparel,"
      - "In gait and countenance surely like a father."
    m:
      - "A merchant or a schoolmaster, sir. Well, I don’t know exactly, but his clothes are respectable, and to judge from his face and walk, he’s old enough to be Lucentio’s father."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "And what of him, Tranio?"
    m:
      - "And what about him, Tranio?"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "If he be credulous and trust my tale,"
      - "I’ll make him glad to seem Vincentio"
      - "And give assurance to Baptista Minola"
      - "As if he were the right Vincentio."
      - "Take in your love, and then let me alone."
    m:
      - "If he’s an easy mark and buys my story, I think I can get him to pose as Vincentio—and be as ready to vouch for you with Baptista Minola as the real Vincentio would. Go, take your sweetheart and leave him to me."

  - os: "Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA"
    ms: "LUCENTIO and BIANCA exit."

  - os: "Enter a MERCHANT"
    ms: "A MERCHANT enters."

  - sp: MERCHANT
    o:
      - "God save you, sir."
    m:
      - "May God keep you well, sir."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)*"
      - "    And you, sir. You are welcome."
      - "Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?"
    m:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* And you too, sir. Welcome. Are you going far, or is this your destination?"

  - sp: MERCHANT
    o:
      - "Sir, at the farthest for a week or two,"
      - "But then up farther, and as far as Rome,"
      - "And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life."
    m:
      - "This is it, for now. Then, in a week or two, I’ll continue on as far as Rome, then on to Tripoli, God willing."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* What countryman, I pray?"
    m:
      - "*(speaking as LUCENTIO)* What country are you from, if I may ask?"

  - sp: MERCHANT
    o:
      - "    Of Mantua."
    m:
      - "Mantua."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid!"
      - "And come to Padua, careless of your life?"
    m:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Mantua, sir? Oh Lord, I hope not. And coming to Padua? Do you want to get killed?"

  - sp: MERCHANT
    o:
      - "My life, sir! how, I pray? For that goes hard."
    m:
      - "Killed? Why? That would be a little extreme!"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "’Tis death for anyone in Mantua"
      - "To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?"
      - "Your ships are stayed at Venice, and the Duke,"
      - "For private quarrel ’twixt your duke and him,"
      - "Hath published and proclaimed it openly."
      - "’Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come,"
      - "You might have heard it else proclaimed about."
    m:
      - "It’s a capital offense for anyone from Mantua to come to Padua. Didn’t you know? The Duke of Padua has publicly proclaimed it. He’s feuding with your duke, and all ships from Mantua are being held up at Venice. It’s strange that you haven’t heard. There are signs up all over town—but I guess it’s because you’ve only just arrived."

  - sp: MERCHANT
    o:
      - "Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so,"
      - "For I have bills for money by exchange"
      - "From Florence, and must here deliver them."
    m:
      - "Oh dear, oh dear. This is very bad, very bad. I have promissory notes from Florence that I have to deliver."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Well, sir, to do you courtesy,"
      - "This will I do, and this I will advise you."
      - "First tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?"
    m:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Well, look, just to be nice I’ll help you out and give you some advice to boot. First tell me, though—have you ever been to Pisa?"

  - sp: MERCHANT
    o:
      - "Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,"
      - "Pisa renownèd for grave citizens."
    m:
      - "Oh yes, sir, I have often been to Pisa—Pisa, City of Wise Men."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Among them know you one Vincentio?"
    m:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* There’s one of them called Vincentio? Do you know him?"

  - sp: MERCHANT
    o:
      - "I know him not, but I have heard of him:"
      - "A merchant of incomparable wealth."
    m:
      - "I’ve heard of him but I’ve never met him. A merchant of unheard-of wealth."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* He is my father, sir, and sooth to say,"
      - "In count’nance somewhat doth resemble you."
    m:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* He is my father, sir, and I have to tell you—you look a little like him."

  - sp: BIONDELLO
    o:
      - "*(aside)* As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all one."
    m:
      - "*(speaking to the audience)* As much as an apple looks like an oyster, but whatever."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* To save your life in this extremity,"
      - "This favor will I do you for his sake—"
      - "And think it not the worst of all your fortunes"
      - "That you are like to Sir Vincentio—"
      - "His name and credit shall you undertake,"
      - "And in my house you shall be friendly lodged."
      - "Look that you take upon you as you should."
      - "You understand me, sir. So shall you stay"
      - "Till you have done your business in the city."
      - "If this be court’sy, sir, accept of it."
    m:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Under the circumstance, to save your life, here’s what I’m willing to do—and it’s actually not an unlucky thing that you happen to look like Sir Vincentio. We’ll pass you off as him—you can assume his name and reputation and stay in my house. You just have to act your part, you understand? You’ll stay here in the city until you’ve taken care of your business. If this is kindness, you’re welcome to it."

  - sp: MERCHANT
    o:
      - "O sir, I do, and will repute you ever"
      - "The patron of my life and liberty."
    m:
      - "Oh sir, I accept. And I’ll be eternally grateful to you."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Then go with me to make the matter good."
      - "This, by the way, I let you understand:"
      - "My father is here looked for every day"
      - "To pass assurance of a dower in marriage"
      - "’Twixt me and one Baptista’s daughter here."
      - "In all these circumstances I’ll instruct you."
      - "Go with me to clothe you as becomes you."
    m:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Then come with me and we’ll set it up. And, by the way, I should probably tell you: my father himself is coming any day to vouch for me in the matter of a dowry—a marriage contract between me and the daughter of a fellow named Baptista. I’ll fill you in on the whole situation. Come, let’s go and get your costume."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
