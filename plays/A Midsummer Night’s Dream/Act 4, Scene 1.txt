    ms: "DEMETRIUS, HELENA, HERMIA, and LYSANDER are still sleeping on the stage. TITANIA enters with BOTTOM, who still has a donkey’s head, and the fairies PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED. OBERON enters behind them, unseen by those onstage."

    o:
      - "*(to BOTTOM)* Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed"
      - "While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,"
      - "And stick musk roses in thy sleek, smooth head,"
      - "And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy."
    m:

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "Monsieur Cobweb, good monsieur, get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle. And, good monsieur, bring me the honey bag. Do not fret yourself too much in the action, monsieur. And good monsieur, have a care the honey bag break not. I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag, signor."
    m:
      - "Monsieur Cobweb, sir, get out your weapons and kill me a striped bumblebee on a thistle, and bring me its honey. Don’t tire yourself out, monsieur. Oh, and monsieur, be careful not to break the honey-sac. I’d hate to see you drowned in honey, sir."

    m:
      - "What would you like me to do?"

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "Nothing, good monsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch. I must to the barber’s, monsieur, for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the face. And I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me, I must scratch."
    m:
      - "Nothing, good sir, except to help Sir Cobweb scratch my head. I should go to the barber’s, monsieur, because I think I’m getting really hairy around the face. And I’m such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little, I need to scratch."

  - sp: TITANIA
    o:
      - "What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?"
    m:
      - "Would you like to hear some music, my sweet love?"

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let’s have the tongs and the bones."
    m:
      - "I have a pretty good ear for music. Let’s hear someone play the triangle and the sticks."

  - sp: TITANIA
    o:
      - "Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat."
    m:
      - "Or tell me, my sweet love, what you’d like to eat."

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "Truly, a peck of provender. I could munch your good dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay. Good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow."
    m:
      - "Actually, I’d like a few pounds of grass. I’d like to munch on some good dry oats. Or maybe I’ve got a hankering for a bundle of hay. There’s nothing like good hay, really sweet hay."

  - sp: TITANIA
    o:
      - "I have a venturous fairy that shall seek"
      - "The squirrel’s hoard and fetch thee new nuts."

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me. I have an exposition of sleep come upon me."
    m:
      - "I’d rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But please don’t let any of your people wake me up. I really want to sleep now."

  - sp: TITANIA
    o:

      - "Oh, how I love thee! How I dote on thee!"
    m:
      - "I’m putting my arms around you just like the woodbine tendril gently twists itself around the sweet honeysuckle, and like the female ivy curls itself around the branches of the elm tree. Oh, how I love you! I’m so crazy about you!"

  - os: "TITANIA and BOTTOM sleep"
    ms: "BOTTOM and TITANIA sleep. ROBIN enters."

  - os: "Enter ROBIN"
    ms: "ROBIN enters."

  - sp: OBERON
    o:
      - "Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet sight?"
      - "Her dotage now I do begin to pity."
      - "For, meeting her of late behind the wood,"
      - "Seeking sweet favors from this hateful fool,"
      - "I did upbraid her and fall out with her."
      - "For she his hairy temples then had rounded"
      - "With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers,"
      - "And that same dew, which sometime on the buds"
      - "Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,"
      - "Stood now within the pretty flowerets’ eyes"
      - "Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail."
      - "When I had at my pleasure taunted her"
      - "And she in mild terms begged my patience,"
      - "I then did ask of her her changeling child,"
      - "Which straight she gave me and her fairy sent"
      - "To bear him to my bower in Fairyland."
      - "And now I have the boy, I will undo"
      - "This hateful imperfection of her eyes."
      - "And, gentle Puck, take this transformèd scalp"
      - "From off the head of this Athenian swain,"
      - "That, he awaking when the other do,"
      - "May all to Athens back again repair"
      - "And think no more of this night’s accidents"
      - "But as the fierce vexation of a dream."
      - "But first I will release the fairy queen."
    m:
      - "Welcome, good Robin. Do you see this sweet sight? Now I’m starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated. I ran into her recently at the edge of the forest, looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot, and I scolded her and argued with her. She had put a wreath of fresh, fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead, and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass. When I had taunted her as much as I wanted to, and she begged me very nicely to leave her alone, I asked her for the stolen Indian child. She said yes right away, and sent a fairy to bring him to my home in Fairyland. And now that I have the boy, I’ll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong. And, gentle Puck, take this transformed ass’ head off of the head of that Athenian man, so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do, they can all go back to Athens. They’ll only remember the events of tonight as a very unpleasant dream. But first I’ll release the fairy queen from the spell."

      - "Hath such force and blessèd power."
      - "Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen."
    m:
      - "Be like you used to be, and see like you used to see. This bud belongs to Diana, the goddess of virginity, and it has the power to undo the effects of Cupid’s flower. Now, Titania, wake up, my sweet queen."

  - sp: TITANIA
    o:
      - "*(waking)* My Oberon, what visions have I seen!"
      - "Methought I was enamored of an ass."
    m:

  - sp: OBERON
    o:
      - "There lies your love."
    m:
      - "There’s your boyfriend, sleeping right over there."

    o:

      - "Oh, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!"
    m:

    m:
      - "Be quiet for a while.—Robin, take off his donkey head.—Titania, get the fairies to play some music, and make these five people sleep more soundly than humans have ever slept before."

  - sp: TITANIA
    o:
      - "Music, ho! Music such as charmeth sleep!"
    m:

  - sp: OBERON
    o:
      - "Sound, music!—Come, my queen, take hands with me,"
      - "And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be."
      - "*(dances with TITANIA)*"
      - "Now thou and I are new in amity,"

These other lovers will get married alongside him, and they’ll all be in high spirits."

      - "Trip we after the night’s shade."
      - "We the globe can compass soon"
      - "Swifter than the wandering moon."
    m:
      - "In that case, my queen, let’s travel silently and solemnly across the globe to where it’s still night, circling the earth faster than the moon does."

  - sp: TITANIA
    o:
      - "Come, my lord, and in our flight"
      - "Tell me how it came this night"
      - "That I sleeping here was found"
      - "With these mortals on the ground."
    m:
      - "While we’re walking, you can tell me how I ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night."

      - "Uncouple in the western valley. Let them go."
      - "Dispatch, I say, and find the forester."
    m:
      - "One of you go find the forest ranger. Since we’re done with the May Day rites and it’s still so early in the morning, my love will have a chance to hear the beautiful music of my hunting dogs barking as they chase their prey. Unleash the dogs in the western valley. Let them go. Now go find the forest ranger."

  - os: "Exit one of the train"
    ms: "A servant exits."

  - o:
      - "We will, fair queen, up to the mountain’s top,"
      - "And mark the musical confusion"
      - "Of hounds and echo in conjunction."
    m:
      - "My beautiful queen, we’ll go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music."

  - sp: HIPPOLYTA
    o:
      - "I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,"
      - "When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear"
      - "With hounds of Sparta. Never did I hear"
      - "Such gallant chiding. For, besides the groves,"
      - "The skies, the fountains, every region near"
      - "Seemed all one mutual cry. I never heard"
      - "So musical a discord, such sweet thunder."
    m:
      - "I was with the heroes Hercules and Cadmus once, when their Spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear. I’d never heard such impressive barking before. The forests, the skies, the mountains, everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds. I’d never heard such raucous music, such pleasant thunder."

  - sp: THESEUS
    o:
      - "My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,"
      - "So flewed, so sanded, and their heads are hung"
      - "With ears that sweep away the morning dew,"
      - "Crook-kneed, and dew-lapped like Thessalian bulls,"
      - "Slow in pursuit, but matched in mouth like bells,"
      - "Each under each. A cry more tunable"
      - "Was never hollaed to, nor cheered with horn,"
      - "In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly."
      - "Judge when you hear."
      - "*(sees the four sleeping lovers)*"
      - "  But, soft! What nymphs are these?"
    m:
      - "My dogs are bred from Spartan hounds. They have the same folds of flesh around their mouths, the same sandy-colored fur, and hanging ears that brush the morning dew off the grass. They have crooked knees and folds of skin under their necks, just like the Spartan hounds. They’re not very fast in the chase, but their barking sounds like bells ringing. Each bark is perfectly in tune with the others, like notes on a scale. No one, anywhere, has ever gone hunting with a more musical pack of dogs. Judge for yourself when you hear them. *(he sees the four lovers sleeping)* But wait a minute! Who are these women?"

  - sp: EGEUS
    o:
      - "My lord, this is my daughter here asleep."
      - "And this, Lysander. This Demetrius is."
      - "This Helena, old Nedar’s Helena."
      - "I wonder of their being here together."
    m:
      - "My lord, that’s my daughter asleep on the ground over there, and this is Lysander here, and this is Demetrius, and this is Helena, old Nedar’s daughter. I don’t understand why they’re all here together."

  - sp: THESEUS
    o:
      - "No doubt they rose up early to observe"
      - "The rite of May, and hearing our intent"
      - "Came here in grace our solemnity."
      - "But speak, Egeus. Is not this the day"
      - "That Hermia should give answer of her choice?"
    m:
      - "They probably woke up early to celebrate May Day and came here for my celebration when they heard I’d be here. But tell me, Egeus. Isn’t today the day when Hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she’ll marry Demetrius?"

  - sp: EGEUS
    o:
      - "It is, my lord."
    m:
      - "It is, my lord."

      - "Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past. Begin these woodbirds but to couple now?"
    m:
      - "Good morning, my friends. Valentine’s Day is over. Are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now?"

  - os: "LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA kneel"

      - "I know you two are rival enemies."
      - "How comes this gentle concord in the world,"
      - "That hatred is so far from jealousy"
      - "To sleep by hate and fear no enmity?"
    m:
      - "*(to LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS)* I know you two are enemies. Has the world really become so gentle and peaceful that people who hate each other have started to trust each other and sleep beside each other without being afraid?"

  - sp: LYSANDER
    o:
      - "My lord, I shall reply amazèdly,"
      - "Half sleep, half waking. But as yet, I swear,"
      - "I cannot truly say how I came here."
      - "But as I think—for truly would I speak,"
      - "And now do I bethink me, so it is—"
      - "I came with Hermia hither. Our intent"
      - "Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,"
      - "Without the peril of the Athenian law—"
    m:
      - "My lord, what I say may be a little confused, since I’m half asleep and half awake. I swear, at the moment I really couldn’t tell you how I ended up here. But I think—I want to tell you the truth, and now that I think about it, I think this is true—I came here with Hermia. We were planning to leave Athens to escape the Athenian law and—"

  - sp: EGEUS
    o:
      - "*(to THESEUS)* Enough, enough, my lord. You have enough!"
      - "I beg the law, the law, upon his head.—"
      - "They would have stol’n away, they would, Demetrius,"
      - "Thereby to have defeated you and me,"
      - "You of your wife and me of my consent,"
      - "Of my consent that she should be your wife."
    m:
      - "*(to THESEUS)* Enough, enough, my lord. You’ve heard enough evidence! I insist that the law punish him—They were going to run away, Demetrius, they were running away to defeat us, robbing you of your wife and me of my fatherly right to decide who my son-in-law will be."

  - sp: DEMETRIUS
    o:
      - "*(to THESEUS)* My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,"
      - "Of this their purpose hither to this wood."
      - "And I in fury hither followed them,"
      - "Fair Helena in fancy following me."
      - "But, my good lord, I wot not by what power—"
      - "But by some power it is—my love to Hermia,"
      - "Melted as the snow, seems to me now"
      - "As the remembrance of an idle gaud"
      - "Which in my childhood I did dote upon."
      - "And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,"
      - "The object and the pleasure of mine eye,"
      - "Is only Helena. To her, my lord,"
      - "Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia."
      - "But like in sickness did I loathe this food."
      - "But as in health, come to my natural taste,"
      - "Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,"
      - "And will for evermore be true to it."
    m:
      - "*(to THESEUS)* My lord, the beautiful Helena told me about their secret plan to escape into this forest. I was furious and followed them here, and the lovely Helena was so in love with me that she followed me. I’m not sure how it happened—but somehow, something made my love for Hermia melt away like snow. My past love for Hermia now seems like a memory of some cheap toy I used to love as a child. Now the only person I love, and believe in, and want to look at, is Helena. I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia. Then I hated her for a time, as a sick person hates the food he usually loves. But now I have my natural taste back, like a sick person when he recovers. Now I want Helena, I love her, I long for her, and I will always be true to her."

    o:
      - "Fair lovers, you are fortunately met."
      - "Of this discourse we more will hear anon.—"
      - "Egeus, I will overbear your will."
      - "For in the temple by and by with us"
      - "These couples shall eternally be knit.—"
      - "And, for the morning now is something worn,"
      - "Our purposed hunting shall be set aside."
      - "Away with us to Athens. Three and three,"
      - "We’ll hold a feast in great solemnity."
      - "Come, Hippolyta."
    m:
      - "You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here. We’ll talk more about this later.—Egeus, I’m overriding your wishes. These couples will be married along with me and Hippolyta in the temple later today.—And now, since the morning is almost over, we’ll give up on the idea of hunting. Come with us to Athens. We three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast. Come, Hippolyta."

      - "Like far-off mountains turnèd into clouds."
    m:

    o:
      - "When everything seems double. Methinks I see these things with parted eye,"
    m:

  - sp: HELENA
    o:
      - "    So methinks."
      - "And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,"
      - "Mine own, and not mine own."
    m:
      - "Me too. I won Demetrius so easily, as if he were a precious diamond I just found lying around. It’s mine because I found it, but I feel like someone else could easily come and claim it was hers."

  - sp: DEMETRIUS
    o:
      - "    Are you sure"
      - "That we are awake? It seems to me"
      - "That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think"
      - "The duke was here, and bid us follow him?"
    m:
      - "Are you sure we’re awake? It seems to me like we’re still sleeping, still dreaming. Do you remember seeing the duke here? Did he tell us to follow him?"

  - sp: HERMIA
    o:

    m:

      - "*(waking)* When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is “Most fair Pyramus.” Heigh-ho! Peter Quince? Flute the bellows-mender? Snout the tinker? Starveling? God’s my life, stol’n hence, and left me asleep? I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream—past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and methought I had—but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream. It shall be called “Bottom’s Dream” because it hath no bottom. And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke. Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death."

      - "*(waking up)* Tell me when my cue comes, and I’ll say my line. My next cue is “Most handsome Pyramus.” Hey! Peter Quince? Flute the bellows-repairman? Snout the handyman? Starveling? My God, they’ve all run away and left me sleeping here? What a weird dream I had.—You can’t even describe such a weird dream. You’d be an ass if you even tried to explain it. I thought I was—no, nobody can even describe what I was. I thought I was, I thought I had—but a person would be an idiot to try to say what I thought I had. No eye has ever heard, no ear has ever seen, no hand has tasted, or tongue felt, or heart described what my dream was like. I’ll get Peter Quince to write this dream down as a ballad. I’ll call it “Bottom’s Dream” because it’s so deep that it has no bottom. And I’ll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play. Or maybe, to make it even more lovely, I’ll sing it when the heroine dies."
