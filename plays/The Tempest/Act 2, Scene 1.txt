    ms: "ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others enter."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "*(to ALONSO)*"
      - "Beseech you, sir, be merry. You have cause,"
      - "So have we all, of joy, for our escape"
      - "Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe"
      - "Is common. Every day some sailor’s wife,"
      - "The masters of some merchant, and the merchant"
      - "Have just our theme of woe. But for the miracle—"
      - "I mean our preservation—few in millions"
      - "Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh"
      - "Our sorrow with our comfort."
    m:
      - "*(to ALONSO)* Please cheer up, sir. Like all of us, you have a good reason to be happy. The fact that we’re alive outweighs our losses. Many people every day feel the sadness we feel now. Every day some sailor’s wife, a ship’s crew, the merchant who hired the ship all experience the same loss we’ve undergone. But the miracle—the fact that we were saved—only happens to a few people out of millions. So remember that, and take comfort in it, to counterbalance our sadness."

  - sp: ALONSO
    o:
      - "    Prithee, peace."
    m:
      - "Please say no more."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "*(to ANTONIO)* He receives comfort like cold porridge."
    m:
      - "*(to ANTONIO)* Alonso enjoys these comforting words about as much as cold oatmeal."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "*(to SEBASTIAN)* The visitor will not give him o’er so."
    m:
      - "*(to SEBASTIAN)* But the goodwill ambassador won’t give up that easily."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "Look he’s winding up the watch of his wit. By and by it will strike."
    m:
      - "*(to ANTONIO)* Look. He’s like a clock winding up to strike the hour."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "*(to ALONSO)* Sir—"
    m:
      - "*(to ALONSO)* Sir—"

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "*(to ANTONIO)* One. Tell."
    m:
      - "*(to ANTONIO)* There he goes! Now we can tell what time it is."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "When every grief is entertained that’s offered,"
      - "Comes to th’ entertainer—"
    m:
      - "If we let every sad thing that happens to us get us down, then we would find ourselves—"

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "A dollar."
    m:
      - "What a pain."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "Dolor comes to him, indeed. You have spoken truer than you purposed."
    m:
      - "Pain, yes indeed. We would find ourselves in pain. You thought you were being funny, but you said the truth."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should."
    m:
      - "You’re taking it more seriously than I meant it."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "*(to ALONSO)* Therefore, my lord—"
    m:
      - "*(to ALONSO)* Therefore, sir—"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "*(to SEBASTIAN)* Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!"
    m:
      - "*(to SEBASTIAN)* God, doesn’t he ever shut up?"

  - sp: ALONSO
    o:
      - "*(to GONZALO)* I prithee, spare."
    m:
      - "*(to GONZALO)* Please, no more."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "Well, I have done. But yet—"
    m:
      - "Well, I’m nearly finished. But just one last thing—"

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "*(to ANTONIO)* He will be talking."
    m:
      - "*(to ANTONIO)* He insists on talking."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow?"
    m:
      - "Hey, let’s bet. Which one will start yammering first, Gonzalo or Adrian?"

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "The old cock."
    m:
      - "The old guy."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "The cockerel."
    m:
      - "I pick the younger one."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "Done. The wager?"
    m:
      - "You’re on. What’s the prize?"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "A laughter."
    m:
      - "A good laugh."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "A match!"
    m:
      - "It’s a deal!"

  - sp: ADRIAN
    o:
      - "Though this island seem to be desert—"
    m:
      - "Though this island may appear desolate—"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "*(to SEBASTIAN)* Ha, ha, ha!"
    m:
      - "*(to SEBASTIAN)* Ha, ha, ha!"

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "So you’re paid."
    m:
      - "Fine, you win."

  - sp: ADRIAN
    o:
      - "Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible—"
    m:
      - "Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible, as it were—"

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "Yet—"
    m:
      - "Now he’s going to say “but”—"

  - sp: ADRIAN
    o:
      - "Yet—"
    m:
      - "But—"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "He could not miss ’t."
    m:
      - "He had to say it, it was unavoidable."

  - sp: ADRIAN
    o:
      - "It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance."
    m:
      - "The island must be mild, and have a temperate climate."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "Temperance was a delicate wench."
    m:
      - "I knew Temperance—she was a fine girl."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly delivered."
    m:
      - "Yes, and she was mild too."

  - sp: ADRIAN
    o:
      - "The air breathes upon us here most sweetly."
    m:
      - "There’s always a breath of fresh air here."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "As if it had lungs, and rotten ones."
    m:
      - "A breath from rotten lungs, maybe."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen."
    m:
      - "Stinking like a swamp."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "Here is everything advantageous to life."
    m:
      - "This island contains everything beneficial to life."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "True. Save means to live."
    m:
      - "True. Everything except something to live on."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "Of that there’s none, or little."
    m:
      - "There’s little or nothing of that."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "How lush and lusty the grass looks! How green!"
    m:
      - "Look how lush and healthy the grass is! How green!"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "The ground indeed is tawny."
    m:
      - "The ground is brown."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "With an eye of green in ’t."
    m:
      - "With a touch of green in it."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "He misses not much."
    m:
      - "He doesn’t miss a thing."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "No, he doth but mistake the truth totally."
    m:
      - "No, he just gets reality completely wrong."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "But the rarity of it is—which is indeed almost beyond credit—"
    m:
      - "But the really unbelievable thing is—and this is incredible—"

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "As many vouched rarities are."
    m:
      - "As most unbelievable things are."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water."
    m:
      - "That our clothes were drenched with sea water, but they came out looking brand-new."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies?"
    m:
      - "Listen to him. If his clothes could talk, they’d call him a liar."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report."
    m:
      - "Or stuff what he says into their pockets."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the king’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis."
    m:
      - "Seriously, I think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the day we put them on in Africa, when we attended the marriage of the king’s daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return."
    m:
      - "It was a lovely wedding, and we’re doing really well on our trip home."

  - sp: ADRIAN
    o:
      - "Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen."
    m:
      - "Tunis has never had such a beautiful queen."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "Not since widow Dido’s time."
    m:
      - "Not since the days of widow Dido."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "Widow! A pox o’ that! How came that “widow” in? Widow Dido!"
    m:
      - "Widow? Why the hell is he calling her “widow Dido”?"

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "What if he had said “widower Æneas” too? Good Lord, how you take it!"
    m:
      - "Next thing you know, he’ll be saying “widower Aeneas.”"

  - sp: ADRIAN
    o:
      - "“Widow Dido” said you? You make me study of that. She was of Carthage, not of Tunis."
    m:
      - "“Widow Dido,” did you say? I’m not sure about that. Dido was from Carthage, not Tunis."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "This Tunis, sir, was Carthage."
    m:
      - "Tunis *was* Carthage, sir."

  - sp: ADRIAN
    o:
      - "Carthage?"
    m:
      - "Carthage?"

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "I assure you, Carthage."
    m:
      - "I’m telling you, it was Carthage."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "His word is more than the miraculous harp. He hath raised the wall and houses too."
    m:
      - "Gonzalo is a miracle-worker. If he says Carthage was here, then Carthage must be here."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "What impossible matter will he make easy next?"
    m:
      - "What miracle will he work next?"

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple."
    m:
      - "I think he’ll carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands."
    m:
      - "And then throw the seeds in the sea, to make more islands grow."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "Ay."
    m:
      - "Yes indeed."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "Why, in good time."
    m:
      - "Absolutely, yes indeed."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "*(to ALONSO)* Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen."
    m:
      - "*(to ALONSO)* Sir, we were saying that our clothes seem just as fresh as they did when we attended the wedding of your daughter, who’s now queen of Tunis."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "And the rarest that e’er came there."
    m:
      - "The most beautiful queen they ever had."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido."
    m:
      - "I beg your pardon, except for the widow Dido."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "Oh, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido."
    m:
      - "Oh, except for the widow Dido? That’s right, except for the widow Dido."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort."
    m:
      - "Isn’t my vest just as clean and fresh as the day I put it on? In a way, I mean."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "That “sort” was well fished for."
    m:
      - "“In a way” is the right way to go."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?"
    m:
      - "I mean when I wore it at your daughter’s wedding."

  - sp: ALONSO
    o:
      - "You cram these words into mine ears against"
      - "The stomach of my sense. Would I had never"
      - "Married my daughter there! For, coming thence,"
      - "My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,"
      - "Who is so far from Italy removed"
      - "I ne’er again shall see her.—O thou mine heir"
      - "Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish"
      - "Hath made his meal on thee?"
    m:
      - "You keep cramming words into my ears that I don’t want to hear. I wish that wedding had never happened, since I lost my son because of it, and I lost my daughter too in a way, since she’s moved so far from Milan that I’ll never see her again.—Oh, dear son of mine and heir of Naples and Milan, what strange fish has made a meal of you?"

  - sp: FRANCISCO
    o:
      - "    Sir, he may live."
      - "I saw him beat the surges under him,"
      - "And ride upon their backs. He trod the water,"
      - "Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted"
      - "The surge most swoll’n that met him. His bold head"
      - "’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared"
      - "Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke"
      - "To th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed,"
      - "As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt"
      - "He came alive to land."
    m:
      - "Sir, he may still be alive. I saw him swimming strongly, almost as if he was riding the waves. He treaded water and kept his head well above the wild waters coming at him, swimming with his strong arms toward the shore, which almost seemed eager to welcome him. I have no doubt he got ashore alive."

  - sp: ALONSO
    o:
      - "    No, no, he’s gone."
    m:
      - "No, no, he’s dead."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,"
      - "That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,"
      - "But rather loose her to an African,"
      - "Where she at least is banished from your eye,"
      - "Who hath cause to wet the grief on ’t."
    m:
      - "Sir, you can thank yourself for this great loss, because you wouldn’t bless Europe with your daughter, but instead pimped her out to an African. At least you can be thankful that she won’t be around to remind you of your loss."

  - sp: ALONSO
    o:
      - "    Prithee, peace."
    m:
      - "Please be quiet."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise"
      - "By all of us, and the fair soul herself"
      - "Weighed between loathness and obedience, at"
      - "Which end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost your son,"
      - "I fear, forever. Milan and Naples have"
      - "More widows in them of this business’ making"
      - "Than we bring men to comfort them."
      - "The fault’s your own."
    m:
      - "We all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans, and your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an African and the desire to obey you. Now I’m afraid we’ve lost your son forever. Our shipwreck has made more women widows in Milan and Naples than there are survivors to comfort them. And it’s all your fault."

  - sp: ALONSO
    o:
      - "    So is the dearest o’ th’ loss."
    m:
      - "And the greatest sorrow is mine too."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "My lord Sebastian,"
      - "The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness"
      - "And time to speak it in. You rub the sore"
      - "When you should bring the plaster."
    m:
      - "My lord Sebastian, even though what you say is true, your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time. You’re rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "    Very well."
    m:
      - "All right, I’ll stop."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "And most chirurgeonly."
    m:
      - "Like a good doctor."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "*(to ALONSO)* It is foul weather in us all, good sir,"
      - "When you are cloudy."
    m:
      - "*(to ALONSO)* It’s bad times for all of us, sir, when you’re feeling gloomy."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "    Foul weather?"
    m:
      - "Bad times?"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "    Very foul."
    m:
      - "Yes, very bad."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "Had I plantation of this isle, my lord—"
    m:
      - "If I could colonize this island, my lord—"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "He’d sow ’t with nettle seed."
    m:
      - "He’d cultivate weeds on it."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "    Or docks, or mallows."
    m:
      - "Or thorn-bushes."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "And were the king on ’t, what would I do?"
    m:
      - "And if I were king of it, you know what I’d do?"

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "’Scape being drunk for want of wine."
    m:
      - "He wouldn’t get drunk much, since there’s no wine here."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "I’ th’ commonwealth I would by contraries"
      - "Execute all things. For no kind of traffic"
      - "Would I admit. No name of magistrate."
      - "Letters should not be known. Riches, poverty,"
      - "And use of service—none. Contract, succession,"
      - "Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard—none."
      - "No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil."
      - "No occupation. All men idle, all."
      - "And women too, but innocent and pure."
      - "No sovereignty—"
    m:
      - "In my kingdom I’d do everything differently from the way it’s usually done. I wouldn’t allow any commerce. There’d be no officials or administrators. There’d be no schooling or literature. There’d be no riches, no poverty, and no servants—none. No contracts or inheritance laws; no division of the land into private farms, no metal-working, agriculture, or vineyards. There’d be no work. Men would have nothing to do, and women also—but they’d be innocent and pure. There’d be no kingship—"

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "    Yet he would be king on ’t."
    m:
      - "He wants to be king in a place with no kingship."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning."
    m:
      - "Yes, he’s getting a bit confused."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "All things in common nature should produce"
      - "Without sweat or endeavor. Treason, felony,"
      - "Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,"
      - "Would I not have. But nature should bring forth"
      - "Of its own kind all foison, all abundance,"
      - "To feed my innocent people."
    m:
      - "Everything would be produced without labor, and would be shared by all. There’d be no treason, crimes, or weapons. Nature would produce its harvests in abundance, to feed my innocent people."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "No marrying ’mong his subjects?"
    m:
      - "There’d be no marriage?"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "None, man. All idle. Whores and knaves."
    m:
      - "No. Everyone would have nothing to do. They’d all be whores and slackers."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "I would with such perfection govern, sir,"
      - "T’ excel the Golden Age."
    m:
      - "I would rule so perfectly that my country would outshine the Golden Age they had in ancient times."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "    ’Save his majesty!"
    m:
      - "Long live his Majesty!"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "Long live Gonzalo!"
    m:
      - "All hail Gonzalo!"

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "*(to ALONSO)*     And—do you mark me, sir?"
    m:
      - "*(to ALONSO)* Are you listening to me, sir?"

  - sp: ALONSO
    o:
      - "Prithee, no more. Thou dost talk nothing to me."
    m:
      - "Oh, please be quiet. You’re spouting empty words."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
      - "I do well believe your highness, and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing."
    m:
      - "You’re absolutely right, your highness. I talked like that to give these gentlemen here a chance to have a good laugh. They love to laugh at empty words."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "’Twas you we laughed at."
    m:
      - "It’s you we were laughing at."

  - sp: GONZALO
    o:
