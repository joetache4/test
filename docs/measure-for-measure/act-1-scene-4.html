<p>This is the point.</p>
<p>The duke is very strangely gone from hence;</p>
<p>Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,</p>
<p>In hand and hope of action: but we do learn</p>
<p>By those that know the very nerves of state,</p>
<p>His givings-out were of an infinite distance</p>
<p>From his true-meant design. Upon his place,</p>
<p>And with full line of his authority,</p>
<p>Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood</p>
<p>Is very snow-broth; one who never feels</p>
<p>The wanton stings and motions of the sense,</p>
<p>But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge</p>
<p>With profits of the mind, study and fast.</p>
<p>He—to give fear to use and liberty,</p>
<p>Which have for long run by the hideous law,</p>
<p>As mice by lions—hath pick’d out an act,</p>
<p>Under whose heavy sense your brother’s life</p>
<p>Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;</p>
<p>And follows close the rigour of the statute,</p>
<p>To make him an example. All hope is gone,</p>
<p>Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer</p>
<p>To soften Angelo: and that’s my pith of business</p>
<p>’Twixt you and your poor brother.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>LUCIO</b>
<p>Here’s the problem. The duke has mysteriously left town. He deluded many men—myself included—with the hope of some military action. But now we hear from government insiders that his publicly announced reasons for leaving were far from his real plans. In his place, and with his full authority, Lord Angelo rules. This is a man whose blood is like melted snow, never warmed by uncontrolled lust, but who represses and dulls his natural appetites with exercises for the mind—studying and fasting. To scare folks who are habitually promiscuous and have evaded the law like mice running past a lion, he’s found a severe act that, if taken literally, would cost your brother his life. He’s arrested him under it and plans to make an example of him by strictly applying this law. All hope is gone, unless you can soften Angelo with your pretty prayers. That’s the essence of this errand between you and your poor brother.</p>

<p>Our doubts are traitors</p>

<p>All their petitions are as freely theirs</p>
<p>As they themselves would owe them.</p>

<p>Our doubts work against us and make us lose the good things we often could win by making us scared to try. Go to Lord Angelo, and show him that when girls plead, men give like gods.
