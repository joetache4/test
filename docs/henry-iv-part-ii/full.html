<b>RUMOR</b>
<p>Open your ears, for which of you will stop</p>
<p>The vent of hearing when loud Rumor speaks?</p>
<p>I, from the orient to the drooping west,</p>
<p>Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold</p>
<p>The acts commenced on this ball of earth.</p>
<p>Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,</p>
<p>The which in every language I pronounce,</p>
<p>Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.</p>
<p>I speak of peace while covert enmity</p>
<p>Under the smile of safety wounds the world.</p>
<p>And who but Rumor, who but only I,</p>
<p>Make fearful musters and prepared defense,</p>
<p>Whiles the big year, swoll’n with some other grief,</p>
<p>Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</p>
<p>And no such matter? Rumor is a pipe</p>
<p>Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,</p>
<p>And of so easy and so plain a stop</p>
<p>That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</p>
<p>The still-discordant wav’ring multitude,</p>
<p>Can play upon it. But what need I thus</p>
<p>My well-known body to anatomize</p>
<p>Among my household? Why is Rumor here?</p>
<p>I run before King Harry’s victory,</p>
<p>Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury</p>
<p>Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</p>
<p>Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</p>
<p>Even with the rebels’ blood. But what mean I</p>
<p>To speak so true at first? My office is</p>
<p>To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</p>
<p>Under the wrath of noble Hotspur’s sword,</p>
<p>And that the King before the Douglas’ rage</p>
<p>Stooped his anointed head as low as death.</p>
<p>This have I rumored through the peasant towns</p>
<p>Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</p>
<p>And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</p>
<p>Where Hotspur’s father, old Northumberland,</p>
<p>Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,</p>
<p>And not a man of them brings other news</p>
<p>Than they have learnt of me. From Rumor’s tongues</p>
<p>They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>RUMOR</b>
<p>Open your ears! For who could possibly block them when loud Rumor speaks? I make the wind my horse, and ride it from the Orient in the east to the place where the sun sets in the west, describing the events taking place in the world. I continually tell lies and I tell them in every language, stuffing men’s ears with falsehoods. I say that things are peaceful when, in reality, concealed hatred is at work, hidden behind smiles of good will. And who but Rumor—who besides me—can make armies prepare anxious defenses, when in fact the world is uneasy for other reasons and there’s no war coming at all? Rumor is like a flute. Guesswork, suspicion, and speculation are the breath that makes it sound, and it’s so easy to play that even the common masses—that dim monster with innumerable heads, forever clamoring and wavering—can play it. But why should I describe myself in such detail to the one group of people who knows exactly what falsehood is all about: a theater audience? Why am I here? King Henry has won the war, and at Shrewsbury, he ended the rebellion against him by defeating Hotspur and his allies, quenching the fire of revolt with the rebels’ own blood. But what am I doing, telling you the truth up front? My job is to spread word that Hotspur in his fury killed Prince Hal, and that Douglas killed the King. I’ve spread this rumor through all the peasant villages from Shrewsbury to the place where I now stand: in front of the worm-eaten, dilapidated castle of Northumberland, Hotspur’s father, who lies within and pretends to be sick. The messengers are coming hot and heavy, and every single one of them will report nothing but what he’s heard from me. Straight from Rumor, they bring pretty tales of false comfort, which are far worse than truthful news of misfortune.</p>

He said that the rebels had been beaten, and that Harry Percy’s spur was cold.

<p>To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down</p>

<p>From whence with life he never more sprung up.</p>
<p>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire</p>

<p>Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</p>

<p>Which, once in him abated, all the rest</p>

<p>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>MORTON</b>
<p>I’m sorry that I must force you to believe this, when I wish to God that I hadn’t seen it myself. But I saw him, in his bloody state, with my own eyes. He was barely able to fight back, exhausted and out of breath. Harry Monmouth’s swift fury beat the unflinching Percy down to the ground, and once he was there, Percy never rose again. To be brief, Percy’s spirit inspired the entire army, down to the dullest peasant. When the news got out that he had been killed, it took the fire and courage away from even the bravest soldiers. Percy’s metal steeled the whole army; when they learned that he had been blunted, they bent and warped like dull, heavy lead. And just as a heavy object gains momentum once it’s pushed into motion, our army, made heavy by Hotspur’s death, suddenly started moving fast—faster than arrows flying toward a target—but they flew toward safety, not toward the battle. Soon, Worcester, that furious Scotsman, was captured. The warlike Douglas, who killed three enemies disguised as King Henry, began to lose courage: he ran away as well, lending his authority to the shameful retreat. But running in fear, he stumbled and was captured. The bottom line is that King Henry has won. He’s sent a speedy force after you, sir, led by young John of Lancaster and Westmoreland. That is the whole story.</p>

<p>There will be time to mourn for this. Sometimes poison can be a kind of medicine: this news, which would have made me sick had I been well, has, because I am sick, made me well. A dying man—his joints weakened by fever, dangling like useless hinges and crumpling under the man’s own weight—will sometimes be stuck with a fit of impatience, causing him to burst out of his caretaker’s arms. My limbs are like that now; once weakened by grief, they’re now enraged by grief, and are three times as powerful as they were before. Away from me, you unmanly crutch! Chain mail armor will cover my hands now. Away from me, you invalid’s cap! You are too fanciful a helmet for this head which is now the target of kings, grown arrogant with their victories. Wrap my head in iron, and then attack me with the roughest things that destiny and hatred will dare to bring upon me in my rage. Let the sky come crashing down! Let the ocean overflow the shores! Let law and order die! And let the world no longer be a stage for a long, drawn-out struggle: let the spirit of Cain, who committed the first murder against his brother Abel, live in every heart. If every heart is a murderer’s heart, this violent play will end, and darkness will shroud the corpses.</p>

<p>Gentle Earl, don’t abandon your wisdom. All your allies are depending on you and your well-being. If you allow yourself to indulge in this kind of stormy emotion, your health will deteriorate even further. Before you said, “Let’s raise an army,” you calculated how the war might end, and you thought carefully about the likeliness of a victory. You knew from the beginning that, once the fighting started, your son might die. You knew that he was treading dangerously, as if on the edge of a precipice: you knew he was more likely to fall over than make it across. You were warned that your son was made of flesh and blood, and that it was possible he’d get hurt. You were warned that his temper and hot-headedness would push him into the most dangerous situations. But you still said, “Go forward.” None of this consideration, even though it was clearly understood, could stop the stubborn course of events. So what happened here? What has been the result of this brave undertaking? Only this: precisely what was likely to happen in the first place.</p>

<p>’Tis more than time.—And, my most noble lord,</p>
<p>I hear for certain, and do speak the truth:</p>
<p>The gentle Archbishop of York is up</p>
<p>With well-appointed powers. He is a man</p>
<p>Who with a double surety binds his followers.</p>
<p>My lord your son had only but the corpse,</p>
<p>But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;</p>
<p>For that same word “rebellion” did divide</p>
<p>The action of their bodies from their souls,</p>
<p>And they did fight with queasiness, constrained,</p>
<p>As men drink potions, that their weapons only</p>
<p>Seemed on our side. But, for their spirits and souls,</p>
<p>This word “rebellion,” it had froze them up</p>
<p>As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop</p>
<p>Turns insurrection to religion.</p>
<p>Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,</p>
<p>He’s followed both with body and with mind,</p>
<p>And doth enlarge his rising with the blood</p>
<p>Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;</p>
<p>Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;</p>
<p>Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,</p>

<b>MORTON</b>
<p>It is the appropriate time. Good sir, I hear for certain, and I tell you truthfully, that the Archbishop of York has raised a powerful army. He motivates his men with both his earthly and his spiritual powers. My lord, your son commanded only his soldiers’ bodies. The word “rebellion” frightened them, separating their bodies from their hearts. It caused them to fight timidly, hesitantly, as though they were taking medicine: their weapons seemed to be on our side, but their spirits and souls were frozen, like fish in an icy pond. But now, the Archbishop turns our rebellion into a religious cause. Everyone believes he’s a righteous and holy man, and they follow him not only in body but also in mind. He enhances his cause by preaching about the blood of good King Richard, which was spilled at Pomfret Castle. The Archbishop claims that he derives his authority from heaven; tells the men that the whole country is bleeding, gasping for life under the terrible leadership of Bolingbroke. And so men from every walk of life flock like sheep to follow him.</p>

<p>All kinds of people make it a matter of pride to heckle me. No man—that foolishly assembled lump of clay—could ever invent something quite as funny as I seem to be to other people. I’m not only witty on my own, but I bring out wit in other people. Look at the two of us, walking here: I look like a sow that’s smothered all of her baby pigs, except for you. If the Prince sent you to serve me for any other reason than to irritate me, I’m a fool. You weedy little son of a bitch: you’re so tiny that you should be a decoration on my hat, not a servant at my feet. I’ve never had a servant before who was as tiny as a ring stone. But I won’t set you in a gold or silver ring; I’ll wrap you in rags and send you back to your master, to be used as a jewel—that youth, the Prince your master, whose chin is still lacking a beard. Why, I’ll grow a beard in the palm of my hand before he’ll have one that he can shave off his face. And yet, this doesn’t stop him from claiming that he has a face for royalty. Well, God will give him a beard whenever he chooses to—there’s not a hair out of place yet. It’s a good thing the Prince’s face is a royal, because a barber will never earn a coin from shaving it. And still, the Prince brags that he’s been a full-grown man since before he was born. He can keep that title, for all I care; I have no affection for him now, I can assure him. What did Master Dommelton say about the satin for my cape and baggy trousers?</p>

<b>LORD BARDOLPH</b>
<p>Yes, there is. Presently, our armies are already in motion, but putting our hope in them is as ridiculous as expecting that early spring buds will produce fruit: at that time of year, buds are more likely to be killed by frost than to bloom. When we want to put up a building, first we survey the land, and then we draw up a set of plans. Then we calculate the cost, and if we can’t afford it, we revise the plans with fewer rooms, or we decide not to build at all. In the great task we’re attempting—the taking down of one kingdom, and the building of another—we have even more reason to evaluate the land and the plans. We must be certain that the foundation is sound, that the engineer is skilled. We must know precisely what we can afford, how ready and able we are, and we must consider the opposing arguments. Otherwise, it becomes a meaningless exercise: papers and numbers, and names of men rather than real, live men. That’s like drawing up plans for a house you can’t possibly afford, building half of it, and then abandoning the partly-built structure to be ruined by the elements.</p>

<p>And being now trimmed in thine own desires,</p>
<p>Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him</p>
<p>That thou provok’st thyself to cast him up.</p>
<p>So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge</p>
<p>Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard,</p>
<p>And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up</p>
<p>And howl’st to find it. What trust is in these times?</p>
<p>They that, when Richard lived, would have him die</p>
<p>Are now become enamored on his grave.</p>
<p>Thou, that threw’st dust upon his goodly head</p>
<p>When through proud London he came sighing on</p>
<p>After th’ admired heels of Bolingbroke,</p>

<p>Let’s continue. We’ll publicly proclaim the reasons we’re fighting. The people are sick of the leadership they themselves supported. They were greedy for it, but now they have overfed. When you build your foundation on the public’s love, you build on shaky and unsure ground. Oh, you foolish masses! You shouted your love for Bolingbroke to the skies, before you knew what he’d turn into. Now that you’re dressed in the things you desired, you monstrous devourer, you’re so full of Bolingbroke that you’re ready to vomit him up. This, you vulgar dog, is just how you emptied your gluttonous stomach of King Richard; and now you want to eat up your dead vomit, and you howl trying to find it. What can you count on in this world? The very people who wanted Richard dead when he was alive are now in love with his corpse. The very people who threw garbage on his noble head when he marched through London in shame behind the admired Bolingbroke are now saying, “Oh Earth, return that King, and take this one!” Curses on men’s thoughts! Only the past and the future appeal to them; whatever they have right now they despise.</p>

A hundred marks is a lot for a poor, solitary woman to take. And I’ve taken it, and taken it, and taken it. And I’ve been fobbed off and fobbed off and fobbed off, day in and day out. It’s horrible to even think about. That’s a terrible way to treat people, unless you think that every woman should be made an ass and an animal, and that she should be opened to every jerk’s molestation.

<p>It’s not such a big deal. Glass is the only good thing to drink out of anyway. And as for the walls, something pretty and comical—or a depiction of the prodigal son; or maybe one of those German hunting scenes, painted on the wall to look like a tapestry—why, those are worth a thousand of those bed curtains and moth-eaten tapestries. Let me borrow just ten pounds, all right? Come on—other than your moodiness, you’re the best wench in England. Go wash your face and withdraw the lawsuit. Come on—don’t be this way with me. Don’t you know me? Come, come, I know somebody put you up to this.</p>

<p>Then I suppose don’t have a prince’s appetite, because right now all I can think about is small beer. But it’s true: all these everyday considerations distance me from my own nobility. It’s disgraceful that I should be familiar with a man like you! To know your name, your face, and your wardrobe so intimately that I know that you have two pairs of stockings: the ones you’re wearing now, and those peach-colored ones. I even know how many shirts you have: one to wear, and one extra. But then, the keeper of the tennis courts knows your wardrobe better than I do, for when you’ve run out of clean shirts, you don’t show up to play. And you haven’t played in a while, because the whore houses have eaten all the rest of your money, which you’d otherwise use to buy more shirts. God only knows whether all the crying brats you’ve fathered will make it to heaven. But then, the midwives say that babies don’t bear the sins of the parents. That’s how the population increases, and families are strengthened.</p>

<p>O yet, for God’s sake, go not to these wars.</p>
<p>The time was, father, that you broke your word,</p>
<p>When you were more endeared to it than now,</p>
<p>When your own Percy, when my heart’s dear Harry,</p>
<p>Threw many a northward look to see his father</p>
<p>Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.</p>
<p>Who then persuaded you to stay at home?</p>
<p>There were two honors lost, yours and your son’s.</p>
<p>For yours, the God of heaven brighten it.</p>
<p>For his, it stuck upon him as the sun</p>
<p>In the gray vault of heaven, and by his light</p>
<p>Did all the chivalry of England move</p>
<p>To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass</p>
<p>Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves.</p>
<p>He had no legs that practiced not his gait;</p>
<p>And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,</p>
<p>Became the accents of the valiant;</p>
<p>For those that could speak low and tardily</p>
<p>Would turn their own perfection to abuse</p>
<p>To seem like him. So that in speech, in gait,</p>
<p>In diet, in affections of delight,</p>
<p>In military rules, humors of blood,</p>
<p>He was the mark and glass, copy and book,</p>
<p>That fashioned others. And him—O wondrous him!</p>
<p>O miracle of men!—him did you leave,</p>
<p>Second to none, unseconded by you,</p>
<p>To look upon the hideous god of war</p>
<p>In disadvantage, to abide a field</p>
<p>Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur’s name</p>
<p>Did seem defensible. So you left him.</p>
<p>Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong</p>
<p>To hold your honor more precise and nice</p>
<p>With others than with him. Let them alone.</p>
<p>The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong.</p>
<p>Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,</p>
<p>Today might I, hanging on Hotspur’s neck,</p>
<p>Have talked of Monmouth’s grave.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>LADY PERCY</b>
<p>For God’s sake, don’t go to these wars! Father-in-law, you once broke your word when you had better reason to keep it than you do now. Your own son Percy—my heart’s beloved Harry—looked northward again and again, hoping to see his father coming with an army. But he hoped in vain. Who persuaded you to stay home that time? Two honors were lost in that battle: yours, and your son’s. As for yours, I hope God will make it shine again. As for Harry’s honor, it clung to him like the sun in a pale blue sky, and by its light every knight in England was moved to act bravely. He was the mirror in which noble youths dressed themselves. All men copied his way of walking, except those who had no legs. And talking loudly and quickly—the one flaw nature had given him—became the speech pattern for all brave men. Those who spoke softly and slowly would corrupt their proper speech, just to seem more like Harry. In speech, bearing, and diet; in inclinations toward pleasure, in military actions, and in moods, he was the target, mirror, example, and rulebook that other men followed. And him—Oh wondrous him! Oh miracle of men!—you left him! The best man in the world, unsupported by you, faced the hideous god of war from a position of weakness. His only defense was the sound of his own name, and that is how you left him. Never insult his memory by letting your honor count more with strangers than with him. Leave them alone: Marshal Mowbray and the Archbishop are strong. If my darling Harry had had half their army, I might be hanging on his neck today, talking about Prince Hal’s grave.</p>

You won’t weigh down my eyelids anymore, or dull my mind to make me forget. Sleep, why do you lie in filthy hovels, stretched out on uncomfortable cots, where insects’ buzzing is the lullaby? Why don’t you lie in the sweet-smelling bedrooms of kings, under opulent canopies, lulled with soft and beautiful music? You drowsy god, why do you lie with the common people in their loathsome beds, leaving the royal bed lonely like a sentry post, or a bell tower? Will you even close the eyes of a ship boy, high up on the whirling mast, and rock him gently in a cradle made of rough, tossing seas and howling winds—winds which take the waves and, curling them over, crashes them through the air with such a deafening noise that they wake death itself? Can you, oh unfair sleep, give rest to a drenched little sailor in the midst of such roughness, and yet deny it to a king? A king on the calmest, stillest night, with everything available for sleep? Then, you happy commoners, put yourselves to bed. The head that wears the crown sleeps uneasily.</p>

<p>The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,</p>
<p>What perils past, what crosses to ensue,</p>
<p>Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.</p>
<p>’Tis not ten years gone</p>
<p>Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,</p>
<p>Did feast together, and in two years after</p>
<p>Were they at wars. It is but eight years since</p>
<p>This Percy was the man nearest my soul,</p>
<p>Who like a brother toiled in my affairs</p>
<p>And laid his love and life under my foot,</p>
<p>Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard</p>
<p>Gave him defiance. But which of you was by—</p>
<p><em>(to WARWICK)</em> You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember—</p>
<p>When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,</p>
<p>Then checked and rated by Northumberland,</p>
<p>Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?</p>
<p>“Northumberland, thou ladder by the which</p>
<p>My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne”—</p>
<p>Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,</p>
<p>But that necessity so bowed the state</p>
<p>That I and greatness were compelled to kiss—</p>
<p>“The time shall come,” thus did he follow it,</p>
<p>“The time will come that foul sin, gathering head,</p>
<p>Shall break into corruption”—so went on,</p>
<p>Foretelling this same time’s condition</p>
<p>And the division of our amity.</p>

<b>KING</b>
<p>Oh God! If only we could read the book of destiny! We’d see how time changes everything, bringing mountains low and melting the land—which is tired of being solid and firm—into the sea. We’d see how the beach is sometimes too wide for even the tide to conquer. We’d see how blind luck can make mockeries of men, and how change can affect you in countless ways. If even the happiest youth could read this book, he’d look at the course of his life—the dangers he’s endured, the challenges that still lie ahead—and he’d shut that book, sit down and die. It was less than ten years ago that Richard and Northumberland loved each other. Then two years later, they were at war. Just eight years ago, Northumberland was the man closest to my heart. Like a brother, he devoted himself to me, dedicating both life and limb to my cause. He even challenged Richard on my behalf. But which of you was there— I think it was you, Warwick—when Richard, his eyes brimming with tears because of Northumberland’s rebellion, spoke these words that now seem prophetic: “Northumberland, you are the ladder that Bolingbroke has climbed to get to the throne.” Although, God knows, it wasn’t my intention then to become king. But the country needed it so badly, I was forced to rise up and become great. “The time will come,” Richard continued, “when this terrible sin, growing in size, will break out into corruption.” That’s how he went on. He predicted our current condition, and the collapse of our alliances.</p>

<p>There is a chronicle for every man’s life, which shows what happened to him in times now past. If you study that chronicle, you can prophecy what lies ahead with some accuracy. The seeds of things to come are buried in the things that have already happened. These seeds grow, and become the children of time. King Richard could look at the pattern of what had gone before and predict perfectly that Northumberland’s betrayal—then still a seed—would someday grow larger, if it could find suitable soil to root in. And you’re the only soil it could have found.</p>

<p>exceeding good command, by heaven. “Accommodated,”</p>
<p>that is when a man is, as they say, accommodated, or when</p>
<p>a man is being whereby he may be thought to be</p>
<p>accommodated, which is an excellent thing.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>BARDOLPH</b>
<p>Excuse me, sir. I’ve heard the word. You call it a turn of phrase? I don’t know anything about phrases, but I’ll fight for the word. It’s a good, soldier-like word; a word with many uses, to be sure. “Accommodated.” You can say that a man is accommodated when he has been furnished with supplies. And you can also say that a man is being accommodated when he’s, you know, being accommodated. Which is an excellent thing.</p>

<p>As I return, I will fetch off these justices. I do see the bottom</p>
<p>of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are</p>
<p>to this vice of lying. This same starved justice hath done</p>
<p>nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the</p>
<p>feats he hath done about Turnbull Street, and every third</p>
<p>word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk’s tribute. I</p>
<p>do remember him at Clement’s Inn, like a man made after</p>
<p>supper of a cheese paring. When he was naked, he was, for</p>
<p>all the world, like a forked radish with a head fantastically</p>
<p>carved upon it with a knife. He was so forlorn that his</p>
<p>dimensions to any thick sight were invincible. He was the</p>
<p>very genius of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey, and the</p>
<p>whores called him “mandrake.” He came ever in the</p>
<p>rearward of the fashion, and sung those tunes to the</p>
<p>overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle,</p>
<p>and swore they were his fancies or his good-nights.</p>
<p>And now is this Vice’s dagger become a squire, and talks as</p>
<p>familiarly of John o’ Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother</p>
<p>to him, and I’ll be sworn he ne’er saw him but once in the</p>
<p>tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the</p>
<p>Marshal’s men. I saw it and told John o’ Gaunt he beat his</p>
<p>own name, for you might have thrust him and all his apparel</p>
<p>into an eel-skin; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion</p>
<p>for him, a court. And now has he land and beefs. Well, I’ll</p>
<p>be acquainted with him, if I return, and ’t shall go hard but</p>
<p>I’ll make him a philosopher’s two stones to me. If the young</p>
<p>dace be a bait for the old pike, I see no reason in the law of</p>
<p>nature but I may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an</p>

<p>When I come back, I’ll expose these judges for the frauds that they are. I can see through this Judge Shallow. Lord, Lord; we old men sure know how to tell lies! This dried-up old judge has done nothing but go on and on to me about how wild he was when he was as a youth, and how many stunts he pulled in the seedy parts of town. Every third word he speaks is a lie, and he’ll tell lies quicker than a Turk will scramble to pay the sultan. I remember him at Clement’s Inn: he looked like a man someone carved after dinner out of a scrap of cheese. When he was naked he looked like a mandrake root, with a fanciful head someone had carved in with a knife. He was so skinny that he was invisible to any man with imperfect vision; he truly was the embodiment of starvation. But he was as horny as a monkey: the whores called him “mandrake,” because mandrake stimulates the sex drive. He was always a little bit behind the times. He would hear the wagon drivers sing their songs, and then he’d go to his worn-out whores and sing them what he’d heard, pretending he had written them himself. And now this vile stick has become a landowner, and he talks about John of Gaunt like he was his own brother. I swear, he only saw Gaunt once, and that was in the arena at the jousting tournament; John of Gaunt cut Shallow’s head with his sword. I saw it all, and I told John of Gaunt that he had beaten his own name, since Shallow was such a gaunt man back then. You could fit him and all his clothes into the skin an eel sheds. An instrument case was as huge as a mansion to him, as big as a courtroom. Now he has land and livestock. Well, I’ll be his friend if I come back. He won’t like it, but I’ll turn him into an unending source of wealth for myself. If small fish can be bait for big fish, I see no reason why I can’t snap my jaws at Shallow. Time will tell, and that’s all I have to say about that.</p>

<p>Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.</p>
<p>Briefly, to this end: we are all diseased,</p>
<p>And with our surfeiting and wanton hours</p>
<p>Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,</p>
<p>And we must bleed for it; of which disease</p>
<p>Our late King Richard, being infected, died.</p>
<p>But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,</p>
<p>I take not on me here as a physician,</p>
<p>Nor do I as an enemy to peace</p>
<p>Troop in the throngs of military men,</p>
<p>But rather show awhile like fearful war</p>
<p>To diet rank minds sick of happiness</p>
<p>And purge th’ obstructions which begin to stop</p>
<p>Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</p>
<p>I have in equal balance justly weighed</p>
<p>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</p>
<p>And find our griefs heavier than our offenses.</p>
<p>We see which way the stream of time doth run</p>
<p>And are enforced from our most quiet there</p>
<p>By the rough torrent of occasion,</p>
<p>And have the summary of all our griefs,</p>
<p>When time shall serve, to show in articles;</p>
<p>Which long ere this we offered to the King</p>
<p>And might by no suit gain our audience.</p>
<p>When we are wronged and would unfold our griefs,</p>
<p>We are denied access unto his person</p>
<p>Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</p>
<p>The dangers of the days but newly gone,</p>
<p>Whose memory is written on the earth</p>
<p>With yet appearing blood, and the examples</p>
<p>Of every minute’s instance, present now,</p>
<p>Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,</p>
<p>Not to break peace or any branch of it,</p>
<p>But to establish here a peace indeed,</p>
<p>Concurring both in name and quality.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ARCHBISHOP</b>
<p>Why am I doing this? That is the question. The short answer is this: we’re all sick. We’ve eaten and drunk too much and stayed up all night, and now we have a burning fever whose only cure is bloodletting. Richard, our late King, was infected with this disease and died from it. But, my good Lord Westmoreland, I’m not here as a physician, nor am I marching with this army as an enemy of peace. What I’m doing is making a frightening show of war, to stop people from indulging all their vices. This will clear the hardening of the arteries which threatens to kill us all. Let me speak more plainly. I’ve carefully considered the options, weighing the harm our armies are likely to cause against the harm we’re already suffering, and I find that our grievances are stronger than our offenses. We can see where things are headed, and the rough times ahead leave us with no choice but to step away from our quiet lives. We have a list of grievances which we can publish at the appropriate time. We offered that list to the King a long time ago, but we could never get an audience with him. We were wronged, and when we tried to speak to the King about it, we were denied access to him by the very men who had wronged us most. We’re in this seemingly unbefitting armor because of the terrible recent violence—the bloodshed from which is still visible on the ground—and because of the terrible things happening now, every minute. We don’t want to harm peace in any way. We want instead to establish a peace that’s real and meaningful.</p>

<p>What thing, in honor, had my father lost,</p>
<p>That need to be revived and breathed in me?</p>
<p>The King that loved him, as the state stood then,</p>
<p>Was force perforce compelled to banish him,</p>
<p>And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,</p>
<p>Being mounted and both rousèd in their seats,</p>
<p>Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,</p>
<p>Their armèd staves in charge, their beavers down,</p>
<p>Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel</p>

<p>My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,</p>
<p>O, when the King did throw his warder down—</p>
<p>His own life hung upon the staff he threw—</p>

<p>What did my father lose that I now need to restore? Richard, the King at the time, loved my father, but given what was happening he had no choice but to banish him. And then, at Coventry, my father and Harry Bolingbroke met in a formal challenge. They were both mounted on their horses and ready to charge. Their horses were neighing, anxiously waiting for their riders’ spurs to drive them forward. Their steel-tipped lances were ready for the attack. The visors of their helmets were down. Their eyes were on fire behind the steel slits. The trumpet sounded, and then—when there was nothing that could have stopped my father from killing Bolingbroke—the King prevented the fight by throwing down his royal scepter. That scepter was a symbol of his life; when he threw it down, he threw down his life and the lives of every man that has since died at war under the leadership of Bolingbroke.</p>

<p>You don’t know what you’re talking about, Lord Mowbray. Bolingbroke at the time was considered the bravest gentleman in England. Who knows who would have won that fight? But even if your father had won, he never would have made it out of Coventry. The whole country hated him, and they loved and prayed for Bolingbroke. They blessed him and adored him even more than the King. But I digress. I was sent here by our general, the Prince, to hear your grievances, and to tell you that he’s prepared to listen to you. If it appears that your demands are legitimate, he’ll give you what you want—except for those things which might suggest that you’re his enemies.</p>

<p>No, no, sir. Listen, the king is tired of getting upset over every little thing. He’s discovered that ending one problem by killing someone only creates two bigger problems in the people left alive. So from now on, he’ll wipe his memory clean, and forget anything that might remind him of the bad things from his past. He knows that he can’t just eliminate every single opponent who crops up. His enemies are rooted in with his friends, to the extent that, if he tries to pull up an enemy, he’ll also uproot and discard a friend. This country’s like a misbehaving wife, who, just when her husband is about to hit her, holds his baby up, and freezes the intended punishment in the very arm that was poised to apply it.</p>

<p>I would you had but the wit; ’twere better than your</p>
<p>dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy</p>
<p>doth not love me, nor a man cannot make him laugh. But</p>
<p>that’s no marvel; he drinks no wine. There’s never none of</p>
<p>these demure boys come to any proof, for thin drink doth so</p>
<p>overcool their blood, and making many fish meals, that they</p>
<p>fall into a kind of male green-sickness, and then, when they</p>
<p>marry, they get wenches. They are generally fools and</p>
<p>cowards, which some of us should be too, but for</p>
<p>inflammation.</p>
<p>A good sherris sack hath a two-fold operation in it. It</p>
<p>ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and</p>
<p>dull and crury vapors which environ it, makes it</p>
<p>apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and</p>
<p>delectable shapes, which, delivered o’er to the voice, the</p>
<p>tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The</p>
<p>second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of</p>
<p>the blood, which, before cold and settled, left the liver white</p>
<p>and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice.</p>
<p>But the sherris warms it and makes it course from the</p>
<p>inwards to the parts’ extremes. It illumineth the face, which</p>
<p>as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little</p>
<p>kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and</p>
<p>inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart,</p>
<p>who, great and puffed up with this retinue, doth any deed of</p>
<p>courage, and this valor comes of sherris. So that skill in the</p>
<p>weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and</p>
<p>learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack</p>
<p>commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that</p>
<p>Prince Harry is valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally</p>
<p>inherit of his father he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land,</p>
<p>manured, husbanded, and tilled with excellent endeavor of</p>
<p>drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is</p>
<p>become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the</p>
<p>first human principle I would teach them should be to</p>
<p>forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>FALSTAFF</b>
<p>I wish you had the wit to accomplish that: it would be worth all your land. My goodness, this young, serious-minded boy doesn’t like me, and no one can make him laugh. But I guess that’s not surprising; after all, he doesn’t drink any wine. None of those prim boys ever amount to anything: weak beer and too many fish dinners makes their blood cool. They all turn anemic, like young girls. And then, when they finally get married, they can only father girls because they don’t have the stuff to produce sons. Non-drinkers are all generally fools and cowards. The rest of us would probably be the same way, except that we’re always drunk. A good sherry wine operates in two ways. First, it rises into the brain and dries out all the foolish, dull, clogged-up fogs that have gathered there. It makes the brain sharp, quick, and inventive; full of nimble, fiery, and beautiful ideas. The voice and tongue give birth to those ideas which, when they grow up, become excellent wit. The second power of good wine is the warming of the blood. Before wine, the blood is cold and sluggish, and this makes the liver—the organ of passion—chilly and pale. A chilly, pale liver is the sign of cowardice and faint-heartedness. But wine warms the blood, making it course from the inner organs to all the extremities. The blood brightens the face, and the rest of the body—which is like a little kingdom in itself—takes that brightening as a signal. Then the spirits of the blood and all the internal organs gather together behind their captain: the heart. The heart draws strength from these followers and, enlarged by them, can accomplish any courageous deed. This is the bravery that comes from wine. Without wine, skill in weaponry doesn’t matter. Wine is what sets that skill in motion. Education is nothing more than idle gold in the devil’s hands, until wine rouses it and puts it to good use. That’s how Prince Harry became valiant. He’s taken the cold blood he inherited from his father and—like unproductive farmland—he fertilized it, planted it, and cared for it, through the hard work of drinking vast amounts of good and potent wine. And so now, he’s become hot and courageous. If I had a thousand sons, the first rule of behavior I would teach them would be to avoid weak drinks, and get themselves addicted to wine.</p>

<p>Open as day for melting charity;</p>
<p>Yet notwithstanding, being incensed he is flint,</p>
<p>As humorous as winter, and as sudden</p>

<p>Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,</p>
<p>When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;</p>
<p>But, being moody, give him time and scope</p>

<b>KING</b>
<p>Only good things for you, Thomas. Why aren’t you with the Prince, your brother? He loves you and you are neglecting him. He cares more about you than any of his other brothers, Thomas; cherish that fact, my boy. After I’m dead, you’ll be in a strong position to help maintain good relations between Prince Hal and his brothers. So don’t ignore him. Don’t turn away his love, and don’t ruin your good relationship with him by seeming cold or distant. He’s kind if he gets his way; he has compassion for others, and he’s generous with charity. But despite all this, once he gets angry, he becomes like a stone. He can be as tempestuous as winter, and can change himself as suddenly as snowflakes at dawn can turn to hail. So watch his temper. When he does something wrong, let him know it—gently, and when he’s in a happy mood. But when he’s ornery, give him room. Wait till his bad mood works itself out, like a beached whale that kills itself by struggling to return to sea. If you can do this, you’ll be a shelter for your friends, and a golden chain that links your brothers together. Once they’re united, the poison of criticism and rumor—which in this day and age is sure to be aimed at them—can’t do them any harm, no matter how explosive and destructive it may be.</p>

<p>Your highness, you’ve got him all wrong. The Prince is only studying his criminal companions, the way one studies a foreign language. In order to truly learn a language, one must learn even the most immodest curse word—which, as you know, is only learned in order to be identified and, thereafter, avoided. So, like vulgar language, the Prince will get rid of his followers when the time is right. Then they’ll live on in his memory as guidelines, by which he’ll judge the conduct of others. In this sense, he’ll change his past bad deeds to good ends.</p>

You sleep with the crown now, father, but you don’t sleep as soundly, or half so deeply, as that man whose head is bound with nothing more than a cheap nightcap, who snores through the night. Oh, you crown! When you pinch the person wearing you, you’re like a great suit of armor worn on a hot day—you burn the person you’re protecting. There’s a feather near my father’s lips, and it’s not moving: if he were breathing, that light, weightless thing would move. My gracious lord! Father! This is a deep sleep indeed—this is a sleep that has removed the golden ring from the heads of many English kings. Father, I owe you tears and a deep grief, and my love, the bonds of family, and a son’s tender feelings will make sure that I pay you lavishly. Your debt to me is this kingly crown, which I am owed as your heir-apparent. <em>(he puts the crown on his head)</em> Look, here it sits, and God will guard it. Even if all the strength in the world were gathered into a single, giant arm, it wouldn’t be able to force this inherited honor from me. I will leave this to my son as you’ve left it to me.</p>

Oh you foolish youth! You long for power that will end up overwhelming you. Wait a little while. What power I have left is held together so weakly that the lightest breeze would blow it away: my life is fading. You stole something from me that would freely have been yours in just a few hours. On my deathbed, you’ve confirmed all my expectations. All your life you showed that you didn’t love me, and now I will die certain of it. There are a thousand daggers in your thoughts, which you’ve sharpened on your stony heart with the hopes of stabbing me in the little time I have left. What? Couldn’t you endure me for half an hour? Then go and dig my grave yourself, and ring the bells to mark your coronation, not my death. Let all the tears that should be shed on my hearse be drops of holy water to bless your head. Just mix me up with the forgotten dust, and give my body—which gave you life—to the worms. Fire my officers, undo my laws; for now the time has come to jeer at authority. Henry the Fifth is crowned: up with foolishness! Down with decorum! Be gone, all you wise advisers! Assemble lazy apes from every region, and make them the royal court of England! Now, you neighboring countries, get rid of your scum. Do you have a criminal who swears, drinks, dances, parties all night, robs, murders, and commits the oldest sins in the newest ways? Then be happy: that man won’t trouble you any longer. England will paint over his guilt with gold. England will give him a position, honor, power. Because Henry the Fifth has removed the barriers to anarchy: he’s taken the restraining muzzle off the dog of misbehavior, and that wild dog will sink his teeth into the flesh of every decent person. Oh my poor kingdom, sick from this civil war! When all my hard work couldn’t keep disorder at bay, what will you do when disorder becomes your caretaker? Oh, you’ll be a wilderness again, and all the wolves who lived here once will once again be your only citizens.</p>

<p>O pardon me, my liege! But for my tears,</p>
<p>The moist impediments unto my speech,</p>
<p>I had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke</p>
<p>Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard</p>
<p>The course of it so far. There is your crown,</p>
<p>And He that wears the crown immortally</p>
<p>Long guard it yours. If I affect it more</p>
<p>Than as your honor and as your renown,</p>
<p>Let me no more from this obedience rise,</p>
<p>Which my most inward true and duteous spirit</p>
<p>Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending.</p>
<p>God witness with me, when I here came in</p>
<p>And found no course of breath within your Majesty,</p>
<p>How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,</p>
<p>O, let me in my present wildness die</p>
<p>And never live to show th’ incredulous world</p>
<p>The noble change that I have purposèd.</p>
<p>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</p>
<p>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,</p>
<p>I spake unto this crown as having sense,</p>
<p>And thus upbraided it: “The care on thee depending</p>
<p>Hath fed upon the body of my father;</p>
<p>Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold.</p>
<p>Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,</p>
<p>Preserving life in med’cine potable;</p>
<p>But thou, most fine, most honored, most renowned,</p>
<p>Hast eat thy bearer up.” Thus, my most royal liege,</p>
<p>Accusing it, I put it on my head</p>
<p>To try with it, as with an enemy</p>
<p>That had before my face murdered my father,</p>
<p>The quarrel of a true inheritor.</p>
<p>But if it did infect my blood with joy</p>
<p>Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride,</p>
<p>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine</p>
<p>Did with the least affection of a welcome</p>
<p>Give entertainment to the might of it,</p>
<p>Let God forever keep it from my head</p>
<p>And make me as the poorest vassal is</p>
<p>That doth with awe and terror kneel to it.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>PRINCE HENRY</b>
<p>Oh forgive me, your highness. If it weren’t for these tears—which are impeding my speech—I would have stopped this harsh scolding before you, in your grief, had spoken and before I had listened so long. There’s your crown. May God, who wears the crown eternally, guard it as yours for a long time. If I care for the crown in any way other than as a symbol of your honor and reputation, let me never rise from this kneeling position. It is my deepest and most dutiful feelings which teach my body to bend and bow to you, causing my outer body to reflect my inner feelings. May God be my witness: when I came in here and saw that you weren’t breathing, my blood ran cold. If I’m lying, may I die as the wild youth I was before, and never live to show the dubious world the transformation I have been planning. Coming to see you, thinking you were dead—and being nearly dead myself, just thinking that you were—I spoke to this crown as though it were alive. I scolded it like this: “The worry you’ve caused has eaten my father alive. So you, the best piece of gold, are actually the worst piece of gold. Other gold, perhaps worth less, is more precious, since it at least brings us health when mixed in our drinks. But you—the best, the most honored, the most famous—have consumed the person wearing you.” And as I accused it, I put it on my head, to fight against it as an enemy who’d killed my father before my very eyes. It was the fight of a loyal child. But may God keep it from me forever—making me like the poorest servant bowing down before it in awe and terror—if it in any way made me happy or arrogant, or if any part of me was the least bit pleased to welcome it and the power it brings.</p>

<p>O my son,</p>

<p>Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed</p>

<p>I met this crown, and I myself know well</p>
<p>How troublesome it sat upon my head.</p>
<p>To thee it shall descend with better quiet,</p>
<p>Better opinion, better confirmation,</p>
<p>For all the soil of the achievement goes</p>
<p>With me into the earth. It seemed in me</p>
<p>But as an honor snatched with boist’rous hand,</p>
<p>And I had many living to upbraid</p>
<p>My gain of it by their assistances,</p>
<p>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</p>
<p>Wounding supposèd peace. All these bold fears</p>
<p>Thou see’st with peril I have answerèd,</p>
<p>For all my reign hath been but as a scene</p>
<p>Acting that argument. And now my death</p>
<p>Changes the mood, for what in me was purchased</p>
<p>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort.</p>
<p>So thou the garland wear’st successively.</p>
<p>Yet though thou stand’st more sure than I could do,</p>
<p>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green,</p>
<p>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</p>
<p>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta’en out,</p>
<p>By whose fell working I was first advanced</p>
<p>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</p>
<p>To be again displaced; which to avoid,</p>
<p>I cut them off and had a purpose now</p>
<p>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</p>
<p>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</p>
<p>Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</p>
<p>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</p>
<p>With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,</p>
<p>May waste the memory of the former days.</p>
<p>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</p>
<p>That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</p>

<b>KING</b>
<p>Oh my son, God made you take it from me so that, in pleading your case so beautifully, you would make me love you more! Come here, Harry. Sit by my bed and listen to what I think will be the last advice I ever give. God knows the unusual paths and indirect, crooked ways that led me to this crown. And I know very well how much anxiety it has caused as I’ve worn it. It will fall to you in bitter peace, with better support and stronger approval. The stain of its obtainment dies now, with me. On me, the crown seemed like an honor grabbed with a violent hand, and many people lived to remind me that they had helped me take it. Eventually, those daily reminders grew into war and bloodshed, doing damage to the peace. You can see how much pain it’s caused me as I’ve fought my foes. My entire reign has been like a play, in which we rehash that disagreement. Now my death changes the show. What I bought, you will inherit. You’ll wear the crown by right of succession. But even though you have a firmer claim to the crown than I had, it’s not firm enough. Anger is still fresh, and my former friends—whom you must make into your friends—have only recently been disarmed. It was their power that first got me the crown, and I feared that same power could take me down. To avoid that, I defeated their rebellion, and planned to lead an army to the Holy Land. I thought that, with nothing to occupy themselves, they’d start eyeing me and my crown. Therefore, my Harry, make it your policy to focus the distracted minds of the people with foreign wars. Military actions abroad will make people forget about troubling matters in the past. I’d say more, but my lungs are so worn out that I don’t have the strength to speak. God forgive me for how I came by the crown, and may he grant that you enjoy it in peace.</p>

<p>If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four dozen of</p>

<p>spirits and his. They, by observing of him, do bear</p>
<p>themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing with</p>
<p>them, is turned into a justice-like servingman. Their spirits</p>
<p>are so married in conjunction with the participation of</p>
<p>society that they flock together in consent like so many wild</p>
<p>geese. If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humor his</p>

<p>men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could</p>
<p>better command his servants. It is certain that either wise</p>
<p>bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases,</p>
<p>one of another. Therefore let men take heed of their</p>
<p>company. I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to</p>
<p>keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two actions, and a’ shall laugh without intervallums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders. O, you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up.</p>

<p>If I were cut into pieces, I’d make four dozen bearded broomsticks like this Master Shallow. It’s amazing to see the similarity between his men’s dispositions and his own. They watch him and behave like foolish judges, and he, by associating with them, turns into a judge-like workman. Their spirits are so closely joined by their intimate involvement, they’re like a flock of wild geese that fly in formation. If I needed a favor from Judge Shallow, I would make his men think that I’m a close friend of his. If I needed something from his men, I would flatter Shallow by telling him that no one commands servants better than he does. One thing’s for sure: the behavior of a wise man and that of an idiot are contagious, like diseases. They spread from person to person, which is why people must be careful about the company they keep. I’ll come up with enough material about this Shallow to keep Prince Hal laughing nonstop for a year. That’s how much time it takes for the current fashion to change six times, or for two lawsuits to be completed. He’ll laugh with no intermission. Oh, a lie told with a measure of truth—or a joke told with a serious face—will go far with a young fellow, who has never had his shoulders weighed down by old age or worries. Oh, he’ll laugh until his face looks like a wet coat that was hung poorly—it’ll be all wrinkled from laughter.</p>

You struck me in the head, the very location of my judgment. With that action, you committed a crime against your father’s own laws. So I did what my power demanded, and imprisoned you. If that was wrong, then—now that you wear the crown—I hope you’ll someday be satisfied with a son who mocks your laws, who scorns the judges who rule in your authority, who disrupts the course of law, and blunts the swords that guard your personal peace and safety. No, even worse than that: a son who disrespects your deputies, and the officers you appoint in your name. Question yourself, and imagine being in your father’s position. Be a father, and imagine a son. Listen to your own dignity being profaned. Watch as your most solemn laws are laughed at so lightly. Behold yourself being so disdained by a son. And then imagine that I take your side, and that in your name I gently silence your son. Soberly consider this, and then pronounce my sentence.

<p>Into the hands of justice.” You did commit me,</p>
<p>For which I do commit into your hand</p>
<p>Th’ unstainèd sword that you have used to bear,</p>
<p>With this remembrance: that you use the same</p>
<p>With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit</p>
<p>As you have done ’gainst me. There is my hand.</p>
<p>You shall be as a father to my youth,</p>
<p>My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,</p>
<p>And I will stoop and humble my intents</p>
<p>To your well-practiced wise directions.—</p>
<p>And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you:</p>
<p>My father is gone wild into his grave,</p>
<p>For in his tomb lie my affections,</p>
<p>And with his spirit sadly I survive</p>
<p>To mock the expectation of the world,</p>
<p>To frustrate prophecies, and to raze out</p>
<p>Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down</p>
<p>After my seeming. The tide of blood in me</p>
<p>Hath proudly flowed in vanity till now.</p>
<p>Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,</p>
<p>Where it shall mingle with the state of floods</p>
<p>And flow henceforth in formal majesty.</p>
<p>Now call we our high court of parliament,</p>

<b>PRINCE HENRY</b>
<p>You’re right, Chief Justice, and you have considered this well. Therefore, keep your position as judge and enforcer. I hope that your honors increase, and that you live to see a son of mine offend and then obey you, as I have. I will live to speak my father’s words: “I am a happy man, to have a man brave enough to punish my own son; and I’m no less happy to have a son that would surrender his greatness, and put himself in the hands of the law.” You imprisoned me, and for that I charge you to continue in my service, with this reminder: you must always be as courageous, just, and impartial as you were with me. Shake my hand. You’ll be like a father to me, and I will say whatever it is you whisper in my ear. I will bow to you, and keep myself humble in the face of your wisdom and experience. And princes, believe me, please: my father lies wild in his grave, for he took my recklessness with him when he died. His sober spirit survives in me, and I will flout the world’s expectations. I will prove their prophecies false, and flush out the rotten opinions of those who judged me based on what I once seemed to be. My behavior, the tide of my blood, used to flow proudly and vainly. But now, it ebbs and turns back toward the sea, where it will mingle with the ocean’s majesty and flow back through my body with formal dignity. Now I will assemble my parliament, and choose such noble officers and advisors that our great country will be able to march alongside the best governed nations. We’ll become acquainted and familiar</p>

<p>But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it known to you,</p>
<p>as it is very well, I was lately here in the end of a displeasing</p>
<p>play to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better.</p>
<p>I meant indeed to pay you with this, which, if like an ill</p>
<p>venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle</p>
<p>creditors, lose. Here I promised you I would be, and here I</p>
<p>commit my body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I will</p>
<p>pay you some, and, as most debtors do, promise you</p>
<p>infinitely. And so I kneel down before you, but, indeed, to</p>
<p>pray for the Queen.</p>
<p>If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you</p>
<p>command me to use my legs? And yet that were but light</p>
<p>payment, to dance out of your debt. But a good conscience</p>
<p>will make any possible satisfaction, and so would I. All the</p>
<p>gentlewomen here have forgiven me; if the gentlemen will</p>
<p>not, then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen,</p>
<p>which was never seen before in such an assembly.</p>
<p>One word more, I beseech you: if you be not too much</p>
<p>cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will continue the</p>
<p>story, with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair</p>
<p>Katherine of France, where, for anything I know, Falstaff</p>
<p>shall die of a sweat, unless already he be killed with your</p>
<p>hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not</p>
<p>the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are too, I will</p>
<p>bid you good night.</p>

<p>First, I’ll tell you what I’m afraid of. Then, I’ll bow, and finally, I’ll make a speech. I fear that this play displeased you; I bow to you out of duty; and finally, I make this speech to ask you for forgiveness. If you’re expecting a good speech now, then I’m in trouble. For I wrote the words I’m about to say, and I’m sure that what I’m about to say will end up getting me in trouble. But I’ll get to the point, and thus I’ll get to the danger. You should know—as you seem to—that I recently came on this stage at the end of some other lousy play, to ask you to be patient and to promise you a better play the next time. I had intended to pay you back for that play with this one. If you didn’t like this play, then—like a businessman who has gambled on a risky venture—I am bankrupt; and you, my sweet creditors, are out of luck. I promised you I would be here, and here I stand to submit myself to your mercy. Give me some mercy and I’ll promise to pay you back again another time. That’s how debtors do it: they always promise to repay. If my talking can’t convince you to let me off the hook, then would you like me to dance? And yet, that would be a cheap payment, to dance myself out of debt. But a person with a good conscience will always seek to pay his debts, and I would do the same. All the women here have forgiven me: if the men won’t, then the men don’t agree with the women, which has never happened in a theater audience before. Just one more thing, if you don’t mind. If fatty meat hasn’t clogged you up yet, our playwright will continue the story with Sir John in it, and entertain you with the beautiful Princess Katharine of France. And speaking of France, as far as I know, Falstaff will die there of the sweating disease—unless, that is, he’s already been killed by your low opinions of him. Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not him. My mouth is tired; when my legs are, too, I’ll say goodnight and take a bow.</p>
