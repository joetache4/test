<p>Why then,</p>
<p>She’s fled unto that peasant Valentine,</p>
<p>And Eglamour is in her company.</p>
<p>’Tis true, for Friar Lawrence met them both</p>
<p>As he in penance wandered through the forest.</p>
<p>Him he knew well, and guessed that it was she,</p>
<p>But, being masked, he was not sure of it.</p>
<p>Besides, she did intend confession</p>
<p>At Patrick’s cell this even, and there she was not.</p>
<p>These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.</p>
<p>Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,</p>
<p>But mount you presently, and meet with me</p>
<p>Upon the rising of the mountain foot</p>
<p>That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled.</p>
<p>Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.</p>

<b>DUKE</b>
<p>That means she’s run off to that rascal Valentine, and Eglamour is with her. I know it’s true, because Friar Lawrence met them both as he wandered through the forest in penance. He knew Eglamour well and guessed that the girl was Sylvia, but he wasn’t sure since she had a mask on. Besides, she’d planned to take confession at Friar Patrick’s chamber tonight, but she didn’t show up. These coincidences confirm that she’s run away. Therefore, I beg you, stop talking and mount your horses immediately. Meet me on the rise at the foot of the mountain that leads toward Mantua, where they fled to. Hurry, kind gentlemen, and follow me.</p>
