      - "Your love and pity doth th’ impression fill"
      - "Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow;"
      - "For what care I who calls me well or ill,"
      - "So you o’er-green my bad, my good allow?"
      - "You are my all the world, and I must strive"
      - "To know my shames and praises from your tongue;"
      - "None else to me, nor I to none alive,"
      - "That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong."
      - "In so profound abysm I throw all care"
      - "Of others’ voices, that my adder’s sense"
      - "To critic and to flatt’rer stoppèd are."
      - "Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:"
      - "  You are so strongly in my purpose bred"
      - "  That all the world besides methinks y’are dead."

      - "*(Continuing from Sonnet 111)* Your love and pity make up for the damage popular opinion has done to my reputation, since what do I care who calls me good or bad as long as *you* gloss over what’s bad about me and acknowledge my good? You’re the entire world to me, and I have to strive to learn what’s good or bad about me from what you say. No one else matters to me, and I matter to no one else alive. *Your* opinion is so powerful with me that it determines what’s right and wrong. I care so little about what other people say that it’s as if I threw their voices into a bottomless pit—that’s how deaf I am to their flattery and criticism. Notice how I disregard the fact that the rest of the world neglects me. You matter so much to me that you’re dead to the rest of the world."
