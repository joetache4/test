    ms: "The FOOL and FABIAN enter."

  - sp: FABIAN
    o:
      - "Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter."
    m:
      - "If you’re my friend, you’ll let me see his letter."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Good Master Fabian, grant me another request."
    m:
      - "Dear Mr. Fabian, do me another favor first."

  - sp: FABIAN
    o:
      - "Anything."
    m:
      - "Anything."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Do not desire to see this letter."
    m:
      - "Don’t ask to see this letter."

  - sp: FABIAN
    o:
      - "This is, to give a dog and in recompense desire my dog again."
    m:
      - "That’s like giving someone a dog as a present, and then asking for the dog back in return."

  - os: "Enter ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and lords"
    ms: "ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and lords enter."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?"
    m:
      - "My friends, are you all Lady Olivia’s servants?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings."
    m:
      - "Yes, sir, we’re part of her entourage."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow?"
    m:
      - "I know you. How are you, my friend?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends."
    m:
      - "I’m better off because of my enemies, and worse off because of my friends."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "Just the contrary. The better for thy friends."
    m:
      - "You mean it the other way around. You’re better off because of your friends."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "No, sir, the worse."
    m:
      - "No, sir, worse off."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "How can that be?"
    m:
      - "How can that be?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me, now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass. So that by my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends, I am abused. So that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes."
    m:
      - "Well, my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot, while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot. My enemies help me understand myself better, which is an advantage, and my friends help me lie about myself, which is a disadvantage. So if four negatives make two affirmatives, I’m worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "Why, this is excellent."
    m:
      - "That’s excellent."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "By my troth, sir, no—though it please you to be one of my friends."
    m:
      - "Don’t say that—unless you want to be one of my friends."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "*(giving a coin)*"
      - "Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there’s gold."
    m:
      - "*(he gives him a coin)* You won’t be worse off because of me: here’s some money."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it another."
    m:
      - "That’s a nice hand you dealt me. But if it’s not double-dealing, sir, I wish you’d deal me another."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "O, you give me ill counsel."
    m:
      - "Oh, you’re a naughty one, encouraging double-dealing."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh and blood obey it."
    m:
      - "Ignore your virtue and nobility just this once, sir, go ahead."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a double-dealer."
      - "There’s another. *(giving a coin)*"
    m:
      - "Well, I’ll commit the sin of double-dealing, and deal you a second coin. Here it is. *(he gives him another coin)*"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Primo, secundo, tertio is a good play, and the old saying is, the third pays for all. The triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind—one, two, three."
    m:
      - "And maybe a third? You know, there’s a game called “third time’s the charm,” which is fun to play, and they always say that three’s a magic number. The three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing, and the church bells chime—one, two, three."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "You can fool no more money out of me at this throw. If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further."
    m:
      - "You can’t get any more money out of me right now. If you tell your lady I’m here to speak with her, and bring her out with you when you come back, you might make me more generous."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness. But, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I will awake it anon."
    m:
      - "Well then, sing a lullaby to your generosity: it’ll nap until I come back. But don’t think I’m doing this because I’m greedy. I’ll be back soon to wake up your generosity."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "The FOOL exits."

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me."
    m:
      - "Here comes the man who rescued me, sir."

  - os: "Enter ANTONIO and OFFICERS"
    ms: "ANTONIO and OFFICERS enter."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "That face of his I do remember well."
      - "Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmeared"
      - "As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war."
      - "A baubling vessel was he captain of,"
      - "For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,"
      - "With which such scathful grapple did he make"
      - "With the most noble bottom of our fleet,"
      - "That very envy and the tongue of loss"
      - "Cried fame and honor on him.—What’s the matter?"
    m:
      - "I remember his face well. Though the last time I saw him it was black from the smoke of war. He was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small. But with that tiny boat he fought such a fierce battle against the largest warship in our fleet that we had to admire his courage and skill even though he caused us a lot of damage.—What’s going on?"

  - sp: FIRST OFFICER
    o:
      - "Orsino, this is that Antonio"
      - "That took the *Phoenix* and her fraught from Candy,"
      - "And this is he that did the *Tiger* board"
      - "When your young nephew Titus lost his leg."
      - "Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,"
      - "In private brabble did we apprehend him."
    m:
      - "Orsino, this is the same Antonio who took the *Phoenix* and her cargo from Crete and captured our ship the *Tiger* during the battle where your young nephew Titus lost his leg. We arrested him here for fighting in the streets. It’s as if he didn’t care we were on the lookout for him here."

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,"
      - "But in conclusion put strange speech upon me."
      - "I know not what ’twas but distraction."
    m:
      - "He was kind to me and took my side in the fight. But then he said strange things to me. He might be insane. I don’t know what else it could be."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "Notable pirate! Thou saltwater thief,"
      - "What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,"
      - "Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,"
      - "Hast made thine enemies?"
    m:
      - "But you’re a famous pirate! A master thief of the seas! What made you stupid and careless enough to come visit the people you robbed and slaughtered?"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "  Orsino, noble sir,"
      - "Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me."
      - "Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,"
      - "Though, I confess, on base and ground enough,"
      - "Orsino’s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither."
      - "That most ingrateful boy there by your side"
      - "From the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth"
      - "Did I redeem. A wreck past hope he was."
      - "His life I gave him and did thereto add"
      - "My love, without retention or restraint,"
      - "All his in dedication. For his sake"
      - "Did I expose myself, pure for his love,"
      - "Into the danger of this adverse town,"
      - "Drew to defend him when he was beset,"
      - "Where being apprehended, his false cunning,"
      - "(Not meaning to partake with me in danger)"
      - "Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,"
      - "And grew a twenty-years-removed thing"
      - "While one would wink, denied me mine own purse,"
      - "Which I had recommended to his use"
      - "Not half an hour before."
    m:
      - "Orsino, sir, please don’t call me those names. I was never a thief or a pirate, though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons. I came here because someone put a spell on me. I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning. He was a wreck, almost past hope. I saved his life and gave him my love, without reservation. I dedicated myself to him. For his sake I ran the risk of revisiting this unfriendly town, and I drew my sword to defend him when he was in trouble. But when the police caught us, he was clever and treacherous enough to pretend he’d never met me before. He acted like someone who barely knew me. He refused to give me my own wallet, which I had lent him only half an hour before."

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "How can this be?"
    m:
      - "How is that possible?"

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "*(to ANTONIO)* When came he to this town?"
    m:
      - "*(to ANTONIO)* When did he come to town?"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "Today, my lord, and for three months before,"
      - "No interim, not a minute’s vacancy,"
      - "Both day and night did we keep company."
    m:
      - "Today, my lord. And for three months before that, we spent every day and night together."

  - os: "Enter OLIVIA and attendants"
    ms: "OLIVIA and attendants enter."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "Here comes the Countess. Now heaven walks on earth."
      - "But for thee, fellow. Fellow, thy words are madness:"
      - "Three months this youth hath tended upon me;"
      - "But more of that anon. *(to an officer)* Take him aside."
    m:
      - "Ah, the countess is coming! An angel is walking on earth. But as for you, mister, what you’re saying is insane. This young man has worked for me for three months; but more about that later. *(to an officer)* Take him away."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "What would my lord, but that he may not have,"
      - "Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?"
      - "Cesario, you do not keep promise with me."
    m:
      - "What can I give you that you want, my lord, except the one thing you can’t have? Cesario, you missed your appointment with me."

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "Madam?"
    m:
      - "Madam?"

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "Gracious Olivia—"
    m:
      - "Dearest Olivia—"

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "What do you say, Cesario?—Good my lord—"
    m:
      - "What do you have to say for yourself, Cesario?—My lord, please—"

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "My lord would speak. My duty hushes me."
    m:
      - "My lord wants to speak. It’s my duty to be quiet."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,"
      - "It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear"
      - "As howling after music."
    m:
      - "If what you have to say is anything like what you used to say, it’ll be as repulsive to my ears as wild screams after beautiful music."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "Still so cruel?"
    m:
      - "Are you still so cruel?"

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Still so constant, lord."
    m:
      - "I am still so faithful, my lord."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "What, to perverseness? You, uncivil lady,"
      - "To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars"
      - "My soul the faithfull’st off’rings have breathed out"
      - "That e’er devotion tendered—what shall I do?"
    m:
      - "What, faithful to being mean and nasty? You’re not polite! I breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered—what more am I supposed to do?"

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Even what it please my lord that shall become him."
    m:
      - "You can do whatever you want as long as it’s socially appropriate."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,"
      - "Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,"
      - "Kill what I love?—A savage jealousy"
      - "That sometimes savors nobly. But hear me this:"
      - "Since you to nonregardance cast my faith,"
      - "And that I partly know the instrument"
      - "That screws me from my true place in your favor,"
      - "Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still."
      - "But this your minion, whom I know you love,"
      - "And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,"
      - "Him will I tear out of that cruel eye"
      - "Where he sits crowned in his master’s spite."
      - "Come, boy, with me. My thoughts are ripe in mischief:"
      - "I’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love"
      - "To spite a raven’s heart within a dove."
    m:
      - "Maybe I should act like the Egyptian thief who kills the woman he loves before he dies? That kind of savage jealousy sometimes seems noble. But listen to me. Since you keep denying the love I feel for you, and since I know who’s stealing my place in your heart, you can go on being cold-hearted, but I’m going to take this boy from you. He knows his master loves you. I’m doing this, even though he’s dear to me, because I know you love him. Come with me, boy. I’m ready to do something extreme. I’ll sacrifice this boy I care for, just to spite a beautiful woman with a heart of stone."

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,"
      - "To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die."
    m:
      - "And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully, if it made your life easier."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Where goes Cesario?"
    m:
      - "Where’s Cesario going?"

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "  After him I love"
      - "More than I love these eyes, more than my life,"
      - "More, by all mores, than e’er I shall love wife."
      - "If I do feign, you witnesses above,"
      - "Punish my life for tainting of my love!"
    m:
      - "Following the one I love more than my eyes or my life. More than I will ever love a wife. That’s the truth. The angels in heaven are my witnesses, and can see how pure my love is."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Ay me, detested! How am I beguiled!"
    m:
      - "Ah, how awful, I feel so used! I’ve been tricked!"

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?"
    m:
      - "Who tricked you? Who treated you badly?"

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?—"
      - "Call forth the holy father."
    m:

    m:
      - "*(to VIOLA)* Come on, let’s go!"

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Whither, my lord?—Cesario, husband, stay."
    m:
      - "Go where, my lord?—Cesario, my husband, stay here."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "Husband?"
    m:
      - "Husband?"

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "  Ay, husband. Can he that deny?"
    m:
      - "Yes, husband. Can he deny it?"

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "Her husband, sirrah?"
    m:
      - "Are you her husband, boy?"

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "  No, my lord, not I."
    m:
      - "No, my lord, not me."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear"
      - "That makes thee strangle thy propriety."
      - "Fear not, Cesario. Take thy fortunes up."
      - "Be that thou know’st thou art, and then thou art"
      - "As great as that thou fear’st."
    m:
      - "You’re afraid, so you hide your identity. But don’t be afraid, Cesario. Accept the good luck that’s come your way. Be the person you know you are, and you’ll be as powerful as this person you fear."

  - os: "Enter PRIEST"
    ms: "The PRIEST enters."

  - o:
      - "  O, welcome, father!"
      - "Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,"

      - "To keep in darkness what occasion now"
      - "Reveals before ’tis ripe) what thou dost know"
      - "Hath newly passed between this youth and me."
    m:
      - "Oh, hello, father! Father, could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man? (I know we wanted to hide it, but now the situation demands that we reveal everything.)"

  - sp: PRIEST
    o:
      - "A contract of eternal bond of love,"
      - "Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands,"
      - "Attested by the holy close of lips,"
      - "Strengthened by interchangement of your rings,"
      - "And all the ceremony of this compact"
      - "Sealed in my function, by my testimony,"
      - "Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave"
      - "I have traveled but two hours."
    m:
      - "They were joined in an eternal bond of love and matrimony, and it was confirmed by a holy kiss and an exchange of rings. I witnessed it all as priest. It took place just two hours ago."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be"
      - "When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case?"
      - "Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow"
      - "That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?"
      - "Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet"
      - "Where thou and I henceforth may never meet."
    m:
      - "*(to VIOLA)* Oh, you little liar! How much worse will you be when you’re older? Maybe you’ll get so good at deceit that your tricks will destroy you. Goodbye, and take her. Just never set foot in any place where you and I might happen to meet."

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "My lord, I do protest—"
    m:
      - "My lord, I swear to you—"

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "  O, do not swear!"
      - "Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear."

    o:
      - "What’s the matter?"
    m:
      - "What’s the matter?"

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home."
    m:
      - "He cut my head and gave Sir Toby a bloody head, too. For the love of God, help us! I’d give forty pounds to be safe at home right now."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Who has done this, Sir Andrew?"
    m:
      - "Who did this, Sir Andrew?"

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "The Count’s gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a coward, but he’s the very devil incardinate."
    m:
      - "The count’s messenger, Cesario. We thought he was a coward, but he fights like a devil."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "My gentleman, Cesario?"
    m:
      - "My Cesario?"

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "’Od’s lifelings, here he is!—You broke my head for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to do ’t by Sir Toby."
    m:
      - "Oh, no, there he is! —You cut my head for no reason. Anything I did to you, I did it because Sir Toby made me."

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you."
      - "You drew your sword upon me without cause,"
      - "But I bespoke you fair and hurt you not."
    m:
      - "Why are you talking like this? I never hurt you. You waved your sword at me for no reason, but I was nice to you. I didn’t hurt you."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me. I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb."
    m:
      - "If a bloody head counts as a hurt, then you hurt me. Apparently you think there’s nothing unusual about a bloody head."

  - os: "Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FOOL"
    ms: "SIR TOBY BELCH and the FOOL enter."

  - o:
      - "Here comes Sir Toby halting. You shall hear more. But if he had not been in drink, he would have tickled you othergates than he did."
    m:
      - "Here comes Sir Toby, limping. He’ll tell you more of the story. If he hadn’t been drunk, he would’ve really roughed you up."

  - sp: ORSINO
    o:
      - "How now, gentleman? How is ’t with you?"
    m:
      - "Hello, sir! How are you?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "That’s all one: has hurt me, and there’s the end on ’t. *(to FOOL)* Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot?"
    m:
