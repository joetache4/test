<b>AUFIDIUS</b>
<p>Conditions! I wish I were a Roman, but I can’t be other than what I am: a Volsce. Conditions! Under what conditions can a treaty be fair to the side that has lost? I’ve fought Martius five times, and every time he has beaten me. And I think he would beat me again in the future if we met in battle as often as we eat. By the elements, if I ever see him face to face again, I’ll kill him or he’ll kill me. My desire to beat him isn’t as honorable as it once was, for while I once wanted to crush him with our forces being equal, fighting fairly sword to sword, but now I’ll stab him however I can and let either my anger or my trickery bring him down.</p>

<b>AUFIDIUS</b>
<p>Bolder, but not as subtle. He’s the only one who has compromised my honor, and for that I will seek vengeance. Neither sleep nor sanctuary, nor being unarmed, nor sick, nor the constraints of the temple or the capitol, the prayers of priests or times of sacrifice, none of these obstacles to my fury will stop me from hating Martius. Wherever I find him, even at home in my brother’s protection, despite the law of hospitality, I’ll wash my fierce hand in his heart. Go to Corioles, find out how it’s being occupied and who’s been taken hostage by the Romans.</p>
