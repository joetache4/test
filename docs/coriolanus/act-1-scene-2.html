<p>You thought it was wise to keep your plans secret until they needed to be revealed, but it seems that the Romans knew your plans as soon as they were hatched. Since they know our intention, we can’t proceed as we had planned: to capture as many towns as possible before the Romans knew we were moving toward them.</p>
