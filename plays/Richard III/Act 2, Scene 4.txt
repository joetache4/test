    ms: "The ARCHBISHOP of York, QUEEN ELIZABETH, her son, the young duke of YORK, and the DUCHESSofYorkenter."

  - sp: ARCHBISHOP
    o:
      - "Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,"
      - "And at Northampton they do rest tonight."
      - "Tomorrow or next day they will be here."
    m:
      - "Last night, I hear, they stayed in Stony Stratford. Tonight they will rest in Northhampton. They’ll be here tomorrow or the next day."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "I long with all my heart to see the prince."
      - "I hope he is much grown since last I saw him."
    m:
      - "I’m dying to see the prince. I hope he’s grown a lot since I last saw him."

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "But I hear no; they say my son of York"
      - "Has almost overta’en him in his growth."
    m:
      - "But I hear he hasn’t. They say my son York has almost passed him in height."

  - sp: YORK
    o:
      - "Ay, mother, but I would not have it so."
    m:
      - "Yes, mother, but I wish I hadn’t."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "Why, my young cousin? It is good to grow."
    m:
      - "Why, dear child? It’s good to grow."

  - sp: YORK
    o:
      - "Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,"
      - "My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow"
      - "More than my brother: “Ay,” quoth my uncle Gloucester,"
      - "“Small herbs have grace; great weeds do grow apace.”"
      - "And since, methinks I would not grow so fast"
      - "Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste."
    m:
      - "Grandmother, one night when we were eating dinner, my uncle Rivers mentioned that I had grown more than my brother. “Yes,” said my uncle Gloucester, “Small plants are graceful, while ugly weeds grow fast.” And since then, I’ve wished I wouldn’t grow so fast, because sweet flowers are slow while the weeds grow in a hurry."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold"
      - "In him that did object the same to thee!"
      - "He was the wretched’st thing when he was young,"
      - "So long a-growing and so leisurely,"
      - "That if this rule were true, he should be gracious."
    m:
      - "Well, it certainly wasn’t true for Richard! As a child, he took such a long time to grow up that, according to his rule, he should have grown up into a gracious adult."

  - sp: YORK
    o:
      - "And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam."
    m:
      - "And no doubt he is, gracious madam."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt."
    m:
      - "I hope he is, but mothers get to have their doubts."

  - sp: YORK
    o:
      - "Now, by my troth, if I had been remembered,"
      - "I could have given my uncle’s grace a flout"
      - "To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine."
    m:
      - "Hey, if I’d remembered something about him, I could have had a good comeback for my uncle, touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "How, my pretty York? I prithee let me hear it."
    m:
      - "What would you have said, my young York? Do tell."

  - sp: YORK
    o:
      - "Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast"
      - "That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old."
      - "’Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth."
      - "Grandam, this would have been a biting jest."
    m:
      - "Indeed, they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old. It took me two years before I had a single tooth. Grandmother, this would have been a biting joke."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?"
    m:
      - "Pretty York, who told you about his teeth?"

  - sp: YORK

      - "Grandam, his nurse."
    m:
      - "His nurse, grandmother."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "His nurse? Why, she was dead ere thou wast born."
    m:
      - "His nurse? Why, she was dead before you were even born."

  - sp: YORK
    o:
      - "If ’twere not she, I cannot tell who told me."
    m:
      - "Well, if it wasn’t her, I don’t know."

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "A parlous boy! Go to, you are too shrewd."
    m:
      - "A mischievous child. Come, come, you are too clever for your own good."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "Good madam, be not angry with the child."
    m:
      - "Good lady, don’t be angry with the child."

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH

  - sp: ARCHBISHOP
    o:
      - "For what offence?"
    m:
      - "What did they do wrong?"

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "The sum of all I can, I have disclosed."
      - "Why, or for what, the nobles were committed"
      - "Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord."

      - "Upon the innocent and aweless throne."
      - "Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre."
      - "I see, as in a map, the end of all."
    m:
      - "Oh no! I see the downfall of my family. The tiger has seized the gentle deer: a tyrant has begun to attack the weak, innocent king. Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre! I can see how all this will end as clearly as if I was looking at a map."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "Accursèd and unquiet wrangling days,"
      - "How many of you have mine eyes beheld?"
      - "My husband lost his life to get the crown,"
      - "And often up and down my sons were tossed"
      - "For me to joy, and weep, their gain and loss."
      - "And being seated, and domestic broils"
      - "Clean overblown, themselves the conquerors"
      - "Make war upon themselves, brother to brother,"
      - "Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterous"
      - "And frantic outrage, end thy damnèd spleen,"
      - "Or let me die, to look on death no more."
    m:
      - "How many times have I had to live through cursed times of violent struggle? My husband lost his life to get the crown, and my sons’ fortunes have been tossed up and down, leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses. And once one of them achieved the throne and had taken care of domestic quarrels, they made war among themselves. It’s a preposterous outrage. Let it end, or let me die so I won’t have to watch any more of it."
