  - os: "Enter SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELO the goldsmith"
    ms: "The SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELO enter."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "I am sorry, sir, that I have hindered you,"
      - "But I protest he had the chain of me,"
      - "Though most dishonestly he doth deny it."
    m:
      - "I’m sorry that I delayed you, sir. But even though he denies it, I swear he got the necklace from me."

  - sp: SECOND MERCHANT
    o:
      - "How is the man esteemed here in the city?"
    m:
      - "What’s this man’s reputation like here in the city?"

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "Of very reverend reputation, sir,"
      - "Of credit infinite, highly beloved,"
      - "Second to none that lives here in the city."
      - "His word might bear my wealth at any time."
    m:
      - "People think very highly of him. The merchants give him unlimited credit. He’s well beloved, second to none in the city. I’d trust him with everything I own."

  - sp: SECOND MERCHANT
    o:
      - "Speak softly. Yonder, as I think, he walks."
    m:
      - "Speak more quietly: I think he’s coming this way."

  - os: "ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE again"
    ms: "ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE enter."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "’Tis so; and that self chain about his neck"
      - "Which he forswore most monstrously to have."
      - "Good sir, draw near to me. I’ll speak to him.—"
      - "Signior Antipholus, I wonder much"
      - "That you would put me to this shame and trouble,"
      - "And not without some scandal to yourself,"
      - "With circumstance and oaths so to deny"
      - "This chain, which now you wear so openly."
      - "Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,"
      - "You have done wrong to this my honest friend,"
      - "Who, but for staying on our controversy,"
      - "Had hoisted sail and put to sea today."
      - "This chain you had of me. Can you deny it?"
    m:
      - "You’re right. And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn’t have! Good sir, stay close to me. I’ll speak to him. Signior Antipholus, I can’t believe you’d put me to this kind of shame and trouble—not to mention the scandal you’ve brought on yourself. You swore I never gave you the necklace, but now you’re wearing it openly. Not only has your lie cost you money, shame, and imprisonment, but you’ve also mistreated this honest friend of mine. If it hadn’t been for this dispute, he would have already hoisted sail and left for sea. You got that necklace from me: can you deny that?"

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "I think I had. I never did deny it."
    m:
      - "I got it from you—I never said I didn’t."

  - sp: SECOND MERCHANT
    o:
      - "Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too."
    m:
      - "Yes, you did, sir. In fact, you swore it."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?"
    m:
      - "Who heard me do that?"

  - sp: SECOND MERCHANT
    o:
      - "These ears of mine, thou know’st did hear thee."
      - "Fie on thee, wretch. ’Tis pity that thou liv’st"
      - "To walk where any honest men resort."
    m:
      - "My own ears heard it, and you know it. To hell with you! It’s a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "Thou art a villain to impeach me thus."
      - "I’ll prove mine honor and mine honesty"
      - "Against thee presently if thou dar’st stand."
    m:
      - "You’re a villain to say this about me. I’ll prove that I’m an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself."

  - sp: SECOND MERCHANT
    o:
      - "I dare, and do defy thee for a villain."
    m:

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Hold, hurt him not, for God’s sake. He is mad.—"
      - "Some get within him; take his sword away."
      - "Bind dromio too, and bear them to my house!"
    m:
      - "*(to SECOND MERCHANT)* Wait! Don’t hurt him, for God’s sake! He’s crazy! Somebody approach him and take away his sword. Tie up Dromio, too, and take them to my house."

  - sp: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "Run, master, run. For God’s sake, take a house."
      - "This is some priory. In, or we are spoiled."
    m:
      - "Run, master, run. For God’s sake, find a house to duck into. This looks like an abbey. Go in, or we’re done for."

  - os: "Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE to the priory"
    ms: "ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE exit into the abbey."

  - os: "Enter the Lady ABBESS"
    ms: "The ABBESS enters."

  - sp: ABBESS
    o:
      - "Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?"
    m:
      - "Be quiet, people! Why have you come here in such a mob?"

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "To fetch my poor distracted husband hence."
      - "Let us come in, that we may bind him fast"
      - "And bear him home for his recovery."
    m:
      - "To get my poor, mad husband out from inside there. Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover."

    o:
      - "I knew he was not in his perfect wits."
    m:
      - "*(to SECOND MERCHANT)* I knew he wasn’t quite in his right mind."

  - sp: SECOND MERCHANT
    o:
      - "I am sorry now that I did draw on him."
    m:
      - "*(to ANGELO)* Now I’m sorry I raised my sword against him."

  - sp: ABBESS
    o:
      - "How long hath this possession held the man?"
    m:
      - "How long has he been possessed like this?"

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,"
      - "And much different from the man he was."
      - "But till this afternoon his passion"
      - "Ne’er brake into extremity of rage."
    m:
      - "This week he was sad, moody, and depressed and very different from his usual self. But it wasn’t until this afternoon that he broke out into violence."

  - sp: ABBESS
    o:
      - "Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea?"
      - "Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye"
      - "Stray’d his affection in unlawful love,"
      - "A sin prevailing much in youthful men"
      - "Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing?"
      - "Which of these sorrows is he subject to?"
    m:
      - "Did he lose a lot of money in a shipwreck? Has a close friend of his died? Has he fallen in love with another woman? That’s a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander. Which of these bad things happened to him?"

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "To none of these, except it be the last,"
      - "Namely, some love that drew him oft from home."
    m:
      - "None of them, except the last one. He fell in love, and that made him leave home often."

  - sp: ABBESS
    o:
      - "You should for that have reprehended him."
    m:
      - "You should have reprimanded him for that."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Why, so I did."
    m:
      - "I did."

  - sp: ABBESS
    o:
      - "  Ay, but not rough enough."
    m:
      - "Fine, but you weren’t harsh enough."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "As roughly as my modesty would let me."
    m:
      - "I was as harsh as I could be while still being a lady."

  - sp: ABBESS
    o:
      - "Haply in private."
    m:
      - "You scolded him in private?"

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "  And in assemblies too."
    m:
      - "And in public too."

  - sp: ABBESS
    o:
      - "Ay, but not enough."
    m:
      - "Fine, but not enough."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "It was the copy of our conference."
      - "In bed he slept not for my urging it;"
      - "At board he fed not for my urging it."
      - "Alone, it was the subject of my theme;"
      - "In company I often glancèd it."
      - "Still did I tell him it was vile and bad."
    m:
      - "It was all we talked about. I kept him awake at night talking about it. He couldn’t eat without me talking about it. When we were alone, it was the only thing I talked about, and when we were with other people, I often found a way to mention it. All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was."

  - sp: ABBESS
    o:
      - "And thereof came it that the man was mad."
      - "The venom clamors of a jealous woman"
      - "Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth."
      - "It seems his sleeps were hinder’d by thy railing,"
      - "And therefore comes it that his head is light."
      - "Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings."
      - "Unquiet meals make ill digestions."
      - "Thereof the raging fire of fever bred,"
      - "And what’s a fever but a fit of madness?"
      - "Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls."
      - "Sweet recreation barred, what doth ensue"
      - "But moody and dull melancholy,"
      - "Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,"
      - "And at her heels a huge infectious troop"
      - "Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?"
      - "In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest"
      - "To be disturbed, would mad or man or beast."
      - "The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits"
      - "Have scared thy husband from the use of wits."
    m:
      - "And that’s why he went crazy. A jealous woman’s poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog. You disturbed his sleep with your complaining, which is why he’s disoriented. You seasoned his food with screams. Stress during mealtime ruins the digestion, and that gave him a raging fever. Fever, as we know, is a kind of madness. You spoiled his fun by fighting with him, and when people can’t enjoy themselves, they grow moody and dull with melancholy—they come very close to being grim and cheerlessly depressed. Next thing you know, all kinds of terrible illnesses break out. Ruining his meals, his enjoyment, and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad. What I’m saying is, your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "She never reprehended him but mildly"
      - "When he demeaned himself rough, rude, and wildly.—"
      - "*(to ADRIANA)* Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?"
    m:
      - "She was always gentle when she scolded him, even when he behaved in the worst and wildest ways. *(to ADRIANA)* Why won’t you defend yourself against this woman?"

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "She did betray me to my own reproof."
      - "Good people, enter and lay hold on him."
    m:
      - "She has tricked me into seeing my own faults. Gentlemen, go in there and grab him."

  - sp: ABBESS
    o:
      - "No, not a creature enters in my house."
    m:
      - "Nobody goes into my house!"

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Then let your servants bring my husband forth."
    m:
      - "Then have your servants bring him out."

  - sp: ABBESS
    o:
      - "Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,"
      - "And it shall privilege him from your hands"
      - "Till I have brought him to his wits again"
      - "Or lose my labor in assaying it."
    m:
      - "No: he came here for sanctuary, and that will protect him from you. I’ll try to bring him back to his right mind and work to the end of my abilities to do so."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "I will attend my husband, be his nurse,"
      - "Diet his sickness, for it is my office"
      - "And will have no attorney but myself;"
      - "And therefore let me have him home with me."
    m:
      - "It’s my place to take care of my husband and nurse him back to health. It is my duty and mine alone. So let me take him home."

  - sp: ABBESS
    o:
      - "Be patient, for I will not let him stir"
      - "Till I have used the approvd means I have,"
      - "With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,"
      - "To make of him a formal man again."
      - "It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,"
      - "A charitable duty of my order."
      - "Therefore depart and leave him here with me."
    m:
      - "Be patient. I’m not going to let him leave until I’ve tried every means to cure him. With my healthful potions, drugs, and holy prayers, I’ll make him a complete man again. Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows; it is a charitable duty my order performs. Therefore, depart, and leave him here with me."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "I will not hence and leave my husband here;"
      - "And ill it doth beseem your holiness"
      - "To separate the husband and the wife."
    m:
      - "I will not depart and leave my husband here. It doesn’t suit your holiness to separate a husband and his wife."

  - sp: ABBESS
    o:
      - "Be quiet and depart. Thou shalt not have him."
    m:
      - "Be quiet and depart. You’re not going to take him."

  - os: "Exit ABBESS"
    ms: "The ABBESS exits."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Complain unto the Duke of this indignity."
    m:
      - "Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Come, go. I will fall prostrate at his feet"
      - "And never rise until my tears and prayers"
      - "Have won his grace to come in person hither"
      - "And take perforce my husband from the Abbess."
    m:
      - "Come with me. I’ll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey."

  - sp: SECOND MERCHANT
    o:
      - "By this, I think, the dial points at five."
      - "Anon, I’m sure, the Duke himself in person"
      - "Comes this way to the melancholy vale,"
      - "The place of death and sorry execution"
      - "Behind the ditches of the abbey here."
    m:
      - "It’s almost five o’clock. The duke will pass by here soon. He always passes here on his way to that melancholy place where criminals are put to death. It’s just behind this abbey."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "Upon what cause?"
    m:
      - "Why is he going there today?"

  - sp: SECOND MERCHANT
    o:
      - "To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,"
      - "Who put unluckily into this bay"
      - "Against the laws and statutes of this town,"
      - "Beheaded publicly for his offense."
    m:
      - "To see an elderly, unlucky merchant from Syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to Ephesus."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "See where they come. We will behold his death."
    m:
      - "Here they come. We will watch the execution."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey."
    m:
      - "Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey."

  - os: "Enter the DUKE OF EPHESUS and EGEON the merchant of Syracuse, bare head, with the headsman and other officers"
    ms: "The DUKE enters with EGEON, who is bareheaded. The executioner and other officers follow."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Yet once again proclaim it publicly,"
      - "If any friend will pay the sum for him,"
      - "He shall not die; so much we tender him."
    m:
      - "One more time, we proclaim this publicly: If anyone will pay this man’s bail, he will not be put to death. This is how well we regard him."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Justice, most sacred duke, against the Abbess."
    m:
      - "Duke, the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "She is a virtuous and a reverend lady."
      - "It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong."
    m:
      - "She’s a virtuous and holy lady. She can’t possibly have done you any wrong."

    o:

      - "Whom I made lord of me and all I had"
      - "At your important letters, this ill day"
      - "A most outrageous fit of madness took him,"
      - "That desp’rately he hurried through the street,"
      - "With him his bondman, all as mad as he,"
      - "Doing displeasure to the citizens"
      - "By rushing in their houses, bearing thence"
      - "Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like."
      - "Once did I get him bound and sent him home"
      - "Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went"
      - "That here and there his fury had committed."
      - "Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,"
      - "He broke from those that had the guard of him,"
      - "And with his mad attendant and himself,"
      - "Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,"
      - "Met us again and, madly bent on us,"
      - "Chased us away, till, raising of more aid,"
      - "We came again to bind them. Then they fled"
      - "Into this abbey, whither we pursued them,"
      - "And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us"
      - "And will not suffer us to fetch him out,"
      - "Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence."
      - "Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command"
      - "Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help."
    m:
      - "Your Highness, you were the one who introduced me to my husband, Antipholus, and suggested I marry him. On this terrible day, a most outrageous fit of madness possessed him. It made him run desperately through the streets with his servant, who is just as mad. He angered all the citizens by rushing into their houses and taking rings, jewels, and anything else he felt like. At one point I managed to get him tied up and sent home so that I could make some order out of all the trouble he caused. But somehow, he broke free from his guards. Then he and his crazy servant found us and chased us away with swords. We got more help and came back to capture them, but then they fled into this abbey. We tried to go in, but the abbess stopped us. She wouldn’t let us get him and she wouldn’t send him out. So please, most gracious duke, order her to bring him out so we can get him some help."

    o:
      - "Long since thy husband served me in my wars,"
      - "And I to thee engaged a prince’s word,"
      - "When thou didst make him master of thy bed,"
      - "To do him all the grace and good I could."
      - "Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate,"
      - "And bid the Lady Abbess come to me."
      - "I will determine this before I stir."
    m:
      - "A long time ago your husband was a soldier in the wars I led. And when you married him and made him the master of your bed, I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him. *(to his followers)* Go, knock on the gate and bid the abbess come out here and speak to me. I’ll settle this before I go"

      - "Between them they will kill the conjurer."
    m:
      - "Mistress! Run and save yourself. My master and his servant broke loose. They’ve beaten the maids and tied up Doctor Pinch. Then they set fire to his beard and threw sewage to put out the flames. My master keeps telling the doctor to relax, while his servant cuts the doctor’s hair in a ridiculous fashion. If you don’t send some help, they’ll kill Doctor Pinch."

      - "To scorch your face and to disfigure you."
    m:
      - "Mistress, I swear on my life that it’s true. It was just moments ago. He’s crying out for you and swears he’ll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you."

    m:
      - "Oh, my, it’s my husband. Look, he can become invisible. Just now we put him in the abbey over here, and now he’s over there. It’s impossible to understand."

He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine, where I was dining with Balthasar. He hadn’t arrived by the time we finished eating, so I went out looking for him. I met him in the street—he was there with that man. *(points to the SECOND MERCHANT)* That’s when this lying jeweler swore that he had already given me the necklace, which, God knows, he hadn’t. He had me arrested for it, and I went with the officer, sending my servant home to get money for the bail. When my servant returned empty-handed, I politely asked the officer to accompany me to my house. On the way, we came across my wife, her sister, and their gang of vile associates. One of them was a man named Pinch: a hungry, narrow-faced villain; a skeleton; a fraud; a raggedy magician and fortune-teller; a needy, hollow-eyed, emaciated wretch; a walking corpse. He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer, and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse. Then, with his thin face leering down at mine, he cried out that I was possessed. Then they all pounced on me, tied me up, carried me away, and left me in a dark, dank cellar in my house. They left me and my servant there, tied together. Eventually I chewed through the ropes and freed myself, and I immediately ran to find you, Your Grace.

Duke Solinus, my husband, and both my children—and you two Dromios, who marked the day of my sons’ births with your own—come into the abbey with me for a new christening. After such a long period of grief, we will have such a celebration!"
