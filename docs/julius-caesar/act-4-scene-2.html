<b>BRUTUS</b>
<p>You’ve described a warm friend who’s cooling off. Remember this, Lucillius. When a friend starts to get sick of you, he treats you artificially. Plain and simple loyalty doesn’t make anyone act phony. But insincere men, like horses who are too lively at the start of a race, make a big show of their spirit.</p>
