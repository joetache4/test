<td class="left">
<b>CASSIUS</b>
<p>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</p>
<p>As well as I do know your outward favor.</p>
<p>Well, honor is the subject of my story.</p>
<p>I cannot tell what you and other men</p>
<p>Think of this life, but, for my single self,</p>
<p>I had as lief not be as live to be</p>
<p>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</p>
<p>I was born free as Caesar. So were you.</p>
<p>We both have fed as well, and we can both</p>
<p>Endure the winter’s cold as well as he.</p>
<p>For once upon a raw and gusty day,</p>
<p>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</p>
<p>Caesar said to me, “Darest thou, Cassius, now</p>
<p>Leap in with me into this angry flood</p>
<p>And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,</p>
<p>Accoutred as I was, I plungèd in</p>
<p>And bade him follow. So indeed he did.</p>
<p>The torrent roared, and we did buffet it</p>
<p>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</p>
<p>And stemming it with hearts of controversy.</p>
<p>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</p>
<p>Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!”</p>
<p>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</p>
<p>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</p>
<p>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</p>
<p>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</p>
<p>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</p>
<p>A wretched creature and must bend his body</p>
<p>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</p>
<p>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</p>
<p>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</p>
<p>How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake!</p>
<p>His coward lips did from their color fly,</p>
<p>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</p>
<p>Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan,</p>
<p>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</p>
<p>Mark him and write his speeches in their books—</p>
<p>“Alas,” it cried, “give me some drink, Titinius,”</p>
<p>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</p>
<p>A man of such a feeble temper should</p>
<p>So get the start of the majestic world</p>
<p>And bear the palm alone.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>CASSIUS</b>
<p>I know this quality in you, Brutus—it’s as familiar to me as your face. Indeed, honor is what I want to talk to you about. I don’t know what you and other men think of this life, but as for me, I’d rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself. I was born as free as Caesar. So were you. We both have eaten as well, and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he. Once, on a cold and windy day, when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks, Caesar said to me, “Cassius, I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there.” As soon as he spoke, though I was fully dressed, I plunged in and called for him to follow. And he did. The water roared, and we fought against it with vigorous arms. And, thanks to our fierce competitiveness, we made progress. But before we reached the end point, Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I will sink!” And just as Aeneas, the hero who founded Rome, emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder, so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar. And this is the man who has now become a god, and I’m a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way. In Spain, Caesar had a fever, and it made him shake. It’s true, this so-called “god”—he shook. His cowardly lips turned white, and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam. I heard him groan—yes, I did—and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried, “Give me some water, Titinius,” like a sick girl. It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone.</p>

<b>CASSIUS</b>
<p>Why, Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant, and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably, as slaves. Men can be masters of their fate. It is not destiny’s fault, but our own faults, that we’re slaves. “Brutus” and “Caesar.” What’s so special about “Caesar”? Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours? Write them together—yours is just as good a name. Pronounce them—it is just as nice to say. Weigh them—it’s just as heavy. Cast spells with them, and “Brutus” will call up a ghost as well as “Caesar.” Now, in the name of all the gods, I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great? Our era should be ashamed! Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men! When was there ever an age, since the beginning of time, that didn’t feature more than one famous man? Until now, no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome. Now, though, in all of Rome, there’s room for only one man. You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus—your ancestor—who would’ve let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule.</p>

<p>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery. I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither, ’twas one of these coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once—but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again, then he put it by again—but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by. And still, as he refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar—for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</p>

<p>I can’t explain it. It was all silly and so I paid no attention. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown—though it wasn’t a real crown, just a small circlet—and, as I told you, he refused it once—though in my opinion he would’ve liked to have it. Then Antony offered it to him again, and he refused it again (though, in my opinion, he was reluctant to take his hand off it). Then Antony offered it the third time. He refused it the third time, and as he refused it the commoners hooted and clapped their chapped hands, and threw up their sweaty hats, and let loose such a great deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it nearly choked Caesar, because he fainted and fell down. As for myself, I didn’t dare laugh, for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air.</p>
