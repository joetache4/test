<p>That ever holds. Who riseth from a feast</p>
<p>With that keen appetite that he sits down?</p>
<p>Where is the horse that doth untread again</p>
<p>His tedious measures with the unbated fire</p>
<p>That he did pace them first? All things that are,</p>
<p>Are with more spirit chasèd than enjoyed.</p>
<p>How like a younger or a prodigal</p>
<p>The scarfèd bark puts from her native bay,</p>
<p>Hugged and embraèd by the strumpet wind!</p>
<p>How like the prodigal doth she return,</p>
<p>With overweathered ribs and ragged sails</p>
<p>Lean, rent, and beggared by the strumpet wind!</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>GRATIANO</b>
<p>That’s always true. Who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when he sat down? Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time? We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it. It’s like when a ship sails out of the harbor with all its flags waving, gently pushed by the wind. When that ship returns, her timber is all weather-beaten and her sails are ragged. That same wind makes the ship thin and poor.</p>
