  - os: "MARIANA veiled, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER, at their stand. Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, VARRIUS, Lords, ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, Provost, Officers, and Citizens, at several doors"
    ms: "MARIANA wearing a veil, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER are at their stand. DUKE VINCENTIO, VARRIUS, lords, ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, the Provost, officers, and citizens enter from several directions."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "My very worthy cousin, fairly met!"
      - "Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you."
    m:
      - "*(to Angelo)* My fellow nobleman, welcome! *(to Escalus)* My faithful old friend, I’m glad to see you."

  - sp: ANGELO, ESCALUS
    o:
      - "Happy return be to your royal grace!"
    m:
      - "Welcome home, your royal grace!"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Many and hearty thankings to you both."
      - "We have made inquiry of you; and we hear"
      - "Such goodness of your justice, that our soul"
      - "Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,"
      - "Forerunning more requital."
    m:
      - "Many hearty thanks to you both. I’ve been asking about you, and I’ve heard such good things about your rule that I just had to thank you publicly, as a preview of more rewards to come."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "You make my bonds still greater."
    m:
      - "You make my debt to you even greater."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,"
      - "To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,"
      - "When it deserves, with characters of brass,"
      - "A forted residence ’gainst the tooth of time"
      - "And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,"
      - "And let the subject see, to make them know"
      - "That outward courtesies would fain proclaim"
      - "Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,"
      - "You must walk by us on our other hand;"
      - "And good supporters are you."
    m:
      - "Oh, you’re extremely worthy, and it’d be wrong of me to hide it in my heart, when it deserves to be written in brass letters, as on a monument, where time can’t erase it. Give me your hand, and let the people see, so they’ll know how proud I am to display my high regard for you. Come, Escalus, you must walk with me on my other side. You make a fine supporter."

  - os: "FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward"
    ms: "FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward."

  - sp: FRIAR PETER
    o:
      - "Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him."
    m:
      - "Now’s the time: speak up and kneel before him."

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard"
      - "Upon a wrong’d, I would fain have said, a maid!"
      - "O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye"
      - "By throwing it on any other object"
      - "Till you have heard me in my true complaint"
      - "And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!"
    m:
      - "Justice, royal duke! Look down here, at a girl—I wish I could say a virgin—who has been wronged. Oh, worthy prince, don’t consider anything else until you’ve heard my valid case and given me justice, justice, justice, justice!"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief."
      - "Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:"
      - "Reveal yourself to him."
    m:
      - "Describe how you’ve been wronged—in what way? By whom? Be brief. Lord Angelo here will give you justice. Tell him your complaint."

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "O worthy duke,"
      - "You bid me seek redemption of the devil:"
      - "Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak"
      - "Must either punish me, not being believed,"
      - "Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!"
    m:
      - "Oh, worthy duke, you’re urging me to ask the devil for help. Listen to me yourself. What I have to say will result either in you not believing and punishing me, or you feeling compelled to right the wrong. Hear me, oh hear me, here!"

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:"
      - "She hath been a suitor to me for her brother"
      - "Cut off by course of justice,—"
    m:
      - "My lord, I’m afraid she’s not in her right mind. She’s appeared before me, begging for her brother, who was executed by the justice system—"

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "By course of justice!"
    m:
      - "By the justice system!"

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "And she will speak most bitterly and strange."
    m:
      - "And she will speak in a very bitter, strange way."

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:"
      - "That Angelo’s forsworn; is it not strange?"
      - "That Angelo’s a murderer; is ’t not strange?"
      - "That Angelo is an adulterous thief,"
      - "An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;"
      - "Is it not strange and strange?"
    m:
      - "I’ll speak strangely, but truthfully. That Angelo’s a liar, isn’t that strange? That Angelo’s a murderer, isn’t that strange? That Angelo’s an adulterous thief, a hypocrite, a man who rapes virgins, isn’t that extremely strange?"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Nay, it is ten times strange."
    m:
      - "That’s strange to the tenth degree."

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "It is not truer he is Angelo"
      - "Than this is all as true as it is strange:"
      - "Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth"
      - "To the end of reckoning."
    m:
      - "It’s just as true as the fact that he’s Angelo, and this is all as true as it is strange. No, it’s true to the tenth degree, for the truth is the truth, no matter how much you multiply it."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Away with her! Poor soul,"
      - "She speaks this in the infirmity of sense."
    m:
      - "Take her away! Poor soul, she’s insane."

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest"
      - "There is another comfort than this world,"
      - "That thou neglect me not, with that opinion"
      - "That I am touch’d with madness! Make not impossible"
      - "That which but seems unlike: ’tis not impossible"
      - "But one, the wicked’st caitiff on the ground,"
      - "May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute"
      - "As Angelo; even so may Angelo,"
      - "In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,"
      - "Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:"
      - "If he be less, he’s nothing; but he’s more,"
      - "Had I more name for badness."
    m:
      - "Oh, prince, I beg you, as you believe in a better world than this one, don’t dismiss me by thinking I’m mad! Don’t assume something’s impossible because it’s unlikely. It’s not impossible that the wickedest wretch on the face of the earth may look just as cautious, as dignified, as fair, as perfect as Angelo—even as Angelo, for all his official finery, badges, titles, and ceremonies, can be an arch-villain. Believe it, royal prince. If he’s less than a wretch, he’s nothing. But he’s more, if only I had more names for badness."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "By mine honesty,"
      - "If she be mad,—as I believe no other,—"
      - "Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,"
      - "Such a dependency of thing on thing,"
      - "As e’er I heard in madness."
    m:
      - "I declare, if she’s mad—as I believe she is—her madness has an oddly rational sound. I’ve rarely heard such coherent logic from someone insane."

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "O gracious duke,"
      - "Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason"
      - "For inequality; but let your reason serve"
      - "To make the truth appear where it seems hid,"
      - "And hide the false seems true."
    m:
      - "Oh, gracious duke, don’t harp on that. But don’t dismiss rational statements because they don’t jibe with appearances. Use your intelligence to uncover the hidden truth, which is obscured by lies that seem like truth."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Many that are not mad"
      - "Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?"
    m:
      - "A lot of sane people make a lot less sense. What would you like to say?"

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "I am the sister of one Claudio,"
      - "Condemn’d upon the act of fornication"
      - "To lose his head; condemn’d by Angelo:"
      - "I, in probation of a sisterhood,"
      - "Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio"
      - "As then the messenger,—"
    m:
      - "I am the sister of one Claudio, sentenced to die by the decree against fornication—sentenced by Angelo. I was about to enter a convent, when my brother contacted me. He sent me a message through a man named Lucio—"

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "That’s I, an’t like your grace:"
      - "I came to her from Claudio, and desired her"
      - "To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo"
      - "For her poor brother’s pardon."
    m:
      - "That’s me, if it please your grace: I came to her from Claudio, and asked her to try her good luck in asking Lord Angelo for her poor brother’s pardon."

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "That’s he indeed."
    m:
      - "Yes, that’s the man."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "You were not bid to speak."
    m:
      - "No one asked you to speak."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "No, my good lord;"
      - "Nor wish’d to hold my peace."
    m:
      - "No, my good lord, but no one asked me to be quiet, either."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "I wish you now, then;"
      - "Pray you, take note of it: and when you have"
      - "A business for yourself, pray heaven you then"
      - "Be perfect."
    m:
      - "I’m asking you now, then. Remember it. And when you have your own business before me, pray heaven you behave yourself."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "I warrant your honour."
    m:
      - "I’ll take notice, your honor."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "The warrants for yourself; take heed to’t."
    m:
      - "The notice is for yourself. Pay attention to it."

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,—"
    m:
      - "This gentleman has told some of my story—"

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Right."
    m:
      - "Right."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "It may be right; but you are i’ the wrong"
      - "To speak before your time. Proceed."
    m:
      - "It may be right, but you’re wrong to interrupt. Proceed."

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "I went"
      - "To this pernicious caitiff deputy,—"
    m:
      - "I went to this wicked, evil deputy—"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "That’s somewhat madly spoken."
    m:
      - "You’re sounding crazy."

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "Pardon it;"
      - "The phrase is to the matter."
    m:
      - "Excuse me—the choice of words is appropriate."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Mended again. The matter; proceed."
    m:
      - "That’s better. Continue."

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "In brief, to set the needless process by,"
      - "How I persuaded, how I pray’d, and kneel’d,"
      - "How he refell’d me, and how I replied,—"
      - "For this was of much length,—the vile conclusion"
      - "I now begin with grief and shame to utter:"
      - "He would not, but by gift of my chaste body"
      - "To his concupiscible intemperate lust,"
      - "Release my brother; and, after much debatement,"
      - "My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,"
      - "And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,"
      - "His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant"
      - "For my poor brother’s head."
    m:
      - "To make a long story short—because it took a while, how I begged, how I prayed and kneeled, how he refused me, and how I replied—I’ll sadly and shamefully get to the awful ending. He wouldn’t release my brother unless I gave my chaste body over to his yearning lust. And after much internal debate, my sisterly pity overcame my honor, and I gave in to him. But having got what he wanted, early the next morning he sent an order for my poor brother’s head."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "This is most likely!"
    m:
      - "*(sarcastically)* This is very believable!"

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "O, that it were as like as it is true!"
    m:
      - "Oh, I wish it were as believable as it is true!"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak’st,"
      - "Or else thou art suborn’d against his honour"
      - "In hateful practise. First, his integrity"
      - "Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason"
      - "That with such vehemency he should pursue"
      - "Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,"
      - "He would have weigh’d thy brother by himself"
      - "And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:"
      - "Confess the truth, and say by whose advice"
      - "Thou camest here to complain."
    m:
      - "Heavens above, you poor fool, you don’t know what you’re saying, or else you’ve been bribed to falsely accuse him. First of all, his integrity is beyond reproach. Next, it makes no sense that he should so vigorously prosecute crimes he himself commits. If he had committed such a crime, he would’ve judged your brother against himself, and not executed him. Someone has put you up to this. Confess the truth, and tell us who urged you to come here with this accusation."

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "And is this all?"
      - "Then, O you blessed ministers above,"
      - "Keep me in patience, and with ripen’d time"
      - "Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up"
      - "In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,"
      - "As I, thus wrong’d, hence unbelieved go!"
    m:
      - "That’s it? Then, oh, you blessed angels above, help me be patient, and let time reveal the evil hiding here behind appearances! Heaven protect your grace from harm. Since you don’t believe me, I have to go."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "I know you’ld fain be gone. An officer!"
      - "To prison with her! Shall we thus permit"
      - "A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall"
      - "On him so near us? This needs must be a practise."
      - "Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?"
    m:
      - "I bet you’d like to go. Officer, take her to prison! Should I permit such destructive, scandalous rumors about someone so close to me? This must be a conspiracy. Who knew about your plan, and that you were coming here?"

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick."
    m:
      - "Someone I wish were here now, Friar Lodowick."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?"
    m:
      - "A holy ghost, probably. Who knows this Lodowick?"

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "My lord, I know him; ’tis a meddling friar;"
      - "I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord"
      - "For certain words he spake against your grace"
      - "In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly."
    m:
      - "My lord, I know him. He’s the sort of friar who’s always meddling in people’s business. I don’t like the man. If he hadn’t been a member of the clergy, I would have punched him out for certain words he spoke against your grace while you were away."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!"
      - "And to set on this wretched woman here"
      - "Against our substitute! Let this friar be found."
    m:
      - "Words against me? Some holy friar this is! And to set this wretched woman here against my replacement! Someone locate this friar."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,"
      - "I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,"
      - "A very scurvy fellow."
    m:
      - "Just yesterday, my lord, I saw her and this friar at the prison. He’s a smart-aleck, a very nasty piece of work."

  - sp: FRIAR PETER
    o:
      - "Blessed be your royal grace!"
      - "I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard"
      - "Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman"
      - "Most wrongfully accused your substitute,"
      - "Who is as free from touch or soil with her"
      - "As she from one ungot."
    m:
      - "God bless your royal grace! I’ve stood by, my lord, and I’ve heard your royal ears deceived. First, this woman has wrongfully accused your replacement, who is as far from any sexual or moral misbehavior with her as she is from a virgin birth."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "We did believe no less."
      - "Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?"
    m:
      - "I never believed anything else. Do you know this Friar Lodowick she’s talking about?"

  - sp: FRIAR PETER
    o:
      - "I know him for a man divine and holy;"
      - "Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,"
      - "As he’s reported by this gentleman;"
      - "And, on my trust, a man that never yet"
      - "Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace."
    m:
      - "I know him for a divine and holy man, not lowdown, and not someone who meddles in earthly pleasures, as this gentleman reports. And, trust me, he’s a man that never slandered your grace."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "My lord, most villanously; believe it."
    m:
      - "My lord, he did, and very maliciously too. Believe it."

  - sp: FRIAR PETER
    o:
      - "Well, he in time may come to clear himself;"
      - "But at this instant he is sick my lord,"
      - "Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,"
      - "Being come to knowledge that there was complaint"
      - "Intended ’gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,"
      - "To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know"
      - "Is true and false; and what he with his oath"
      - "And all probation will make up full clear,"
      - "Whensoever he’s convented. First, for this woman."
      - "To justify this worthy nobleman,"
      - "So vulgarly and personally accused,"
      - "Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,"
      - "Till she herself confess it."
    m:
      - "Well, in time he may come to clear himself, but at this instant he’s sick, my lord, suffering a rare fever. Learning there was an accusation planned against Lord Angelo, he personally asked me to come here and speak, as he would have, about what he knows is true and false. And when he’s summoned, he’ll give his oath and furnish proof that will clear everything up. This worthy nobleman, who’s been so publicly and personally accused, will be vindicated, and this woman will be discredited to her face, to such an extent that she herself will have to admit it."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Good friar, let’s hear it."
    m:
      - "Good friar, let’s hear it."

  - os: "ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward"
    ms: "ISABELLA is taken away, under guard, and MARIANA comes forward, wearing a veil."

  - o:
      - "Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?"
      - "O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!"
      - "Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;"
      - "In this I’ll be impartial; be you judge"
      - "Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?"
      - "First, let her show her face, and after speak."
    m:
      - "Isn’t this funny, Lord Angelo? Oh, heaven, the nerve of these wretched fools! Give us some seats. Come, Angelo, my friend. I won’t take any part in this. You be the judge of your own case. Is this the witness, friar? First, let her show her face, and then speak."

  - sp: MARIANA
    o:
      - "Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face"
      - "Until my husband bid me."
    m:
      - "Pardon me, my lord. I will not show my face until my husband bids me to."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "What, are you married?"
    m:
      - "What, are you married?"

  - sp: MARIANA
    o:
      - "No, my lord."
    m:
      - "No, my lord."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Are you a maid?"
    m:
      - "Are you single?"

  - sp: MARIANA
    o:
      - "No, my lord."
    m:
      - "No, my lord."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "A widow, then?"
    m:
      - "A widow, then?"

  - sp: MARIANA
    o:
      - "Neither, my lord."
    m:
      - "Neither, my lord."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?"
    m:
      - "So, you are neither single, widow, nor wife?"

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are"
      - "neither maid, widow, nor wife."
    m:
      - "My lord, she may be a prostitute. Many of them are neither virgin, widow, nor wife."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause"
      - "To prattle for himself."
    m:
      - "Keep that fellow quiet. I wish he were up on some charge of his own."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Well, my lord."
    m:
      - "OK, my lord."

  - sp: MARIANA
    o:
      - "My lord; I do confess I ne’er was married;"
      - "And I confess besides I am no maid:"
      - "I have known my husband; yet my husband"
      - "Knows not that ever he knew me."

One thing is rewarded by a similar thing, and the measure of justice you use will be the measure used against you.
