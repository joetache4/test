<p>Forget about you, you worthless girl! You disobedient wretch! I’ll tell you what. Go to church on Thursday or never look me in the face again. Don’t say anything. Don’t reply. Don’t talk back to me. <em>(JULIET rises)</em> I feel like slapping you. Wife, we never thought ourselves blessed that God only gave us this one child. But now I see that this one is one too many. We were cursed when we had her. She disgusts me, the little hussy!</p>

<p>Goddammit! It makes me mad. Day and night, hour after hour, all the time, at work, at play, alone, in company, my top priority has always been to find her a husband. Now I’ve provided a husband from a noble family, who is good-looking, young, well-educated. He’s full of good qualities. He’s the man of any girl’s dreams. But this wretched, whimpering fool, like a whining puppet, she looks at this good fortune and answers, “I won’t get married. I can’t fall in love. I’m too young. Please, excuse me.” Well, if you won’t get married, I’ll excuse you. Eat wherever you want, but you can no longer live under my roof. Consider that. Think about it. I’m not in the habit of joking. Thursday is coming. Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice. If you act like my daughter, I’ll marry you to my friend. If you don’t act like my daughter, you can beg, starve, and die in the streets. I swear on my soul, I will never take you back or do anything for you. Believe me. Think about it. I won’t break this promise.</p>

<p>Faith, here it is.</p>
<p>Romeo is banishèd, and all the world to nothing</p>
<p>That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.</p>
<p>Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.</p>
<p>Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,</p>
<p>I think it best you married with the county.</p>
<p>Oh, he’s a lovely gentleman.</p>
<p>Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,</p>
<p>Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye</p>
<p>As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,</p>
<p>I think you are happy in this second match,</p>
<p>For it excels your first. Or if it did not,</p>
<p>Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,</p>

<b>NURSE</b>
<p>This is what I have to say: Romeo has been banished. And it’s a sure thing that he will never come back to challenge you. If he does come back, he’ll have to sneak back undercover. Then, since things are the way they are, I think the best thing to do is to marry the count. Oh, he’s a lovely gentleman! Romeo’s a dishcloth compared to him. Madam, an eagle does not have eyes as green, as quick, and as fair as the eyes of Paris. Curse my very heart, but I think you should be happy in this second marriage, because it’s better than your first. Even if it’s not better, your first marriage is over. Or if Romeo is as good as Paris, Romeo doesn’t live here, so you don’t get to enjoy him.</p>
