<p>Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly. I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.</p>

<p>If it’s that important, then let the women die. It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing, but if it’s a matter of choosing between them and a great cause, then they’re worthless. If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this, she’ll die immediately. I’ve seen her claim to be dying twenty times before, and for far less reason. I think there must be something invigorating about death, since she dies with such enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth, comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief is crowned with consolation. Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ENOBARBUS</b>
<p>Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks. When a man’s wife dies, he can be comforted by the knowledge that there are replacements to be found. If Fulvia were the last woman on earth, there would be a reason to grieve. But in this way, grief and comfort appear together. The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose.</p>

<p>No more light answers. Let our officers</p>

<p>The cause of our expedience to the Queen</p>

<p>The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,</p>
<p>Do strongly speak to us, but the letters too</p>
<p>Of many our contriving friends in Rome</p>
<p>Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius</p>
<p>Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands</p>
<p>The empire of the sea. Our slippery people,</p>
<p>Whose love is never linked to the deserver</p>
<p>Till his deserts are past, begin to throw</p>
<p>Pompey the Great and all his dignities</p>
<p>Upon his son, who—high in name and power,</p>
<p>Higher than both in blood and life—stands up</p>
<p>For the main soldier, whose quality, going on,</p>
<p>The sides o’ th’ world may danger. Much is breeding</p>
<p>Which, like the courser’s hair, hath yet but life,</p>
<p>And not a serpent’s poison. Say our pleasure,</p>
<p>To such whose place is under us, requires</p>
<p>Our quick remove from hence.</p>

<b>ANTONY</b>
<p>Enough of this frivolous talk. Give our officers notice of our intentions. I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave. Fulvia’s death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go; friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return. Sextus Pompeius has challenged Caesar. His fleet controls the sea. Our fickle citizens—who never reward service until that service is over—are now giving all the rights and honors won by Pompey the Great to his son, Sextus. Sextus has great honor and power, and his spirit and energy are even greater, all of which makes him the most formidable soldier in the empire. The empire may be in danger if he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential. There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats. Like horse’s hairs dropped in a bucket of water, they come alive like snakes but as yet they bear no poison. Relay our intentions to the officers who will be in charge of the move.</p>
