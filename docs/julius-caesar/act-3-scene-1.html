But I’m as immovable as the northern star, whose stable and stationary quality has no equal in the sky. The sky shows countless stars. They’re all made of fire, and each one shines. But only one among all of them remains in a fixed position. So it is on earth. The world is full of men, and men are flesh and blood, and they are capable of reason. Yet out of all of them, I know only one who is unassailable, who never moves from his position. To show you that that’s me, let me prove it a little even in this case. I was firm in ordering that Cimber be banished, and I remain firm in that decision.</p>

<p><em>(falls prostrate)</em> Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,</p>
<p>And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:</p>
<p>Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest.</p>
<p>Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.</p>
<p>Say I love Brutus, and I honor him.</p>
<p>Say I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him.</p>
<p>If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony</p>
<p>May safely come to him and be resolved</p>
<p>How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,</p>
<p>Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead</p>
<p>So well as Brutus living, but will follow</p>
<p>The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus</p>
<p>Thorough the hazards of this untrod state</p>
<p>With all true faith. So says my master Antony.</p>

<p><em>(kneeling)</em> Brutus, my master ordered me to kneel like this. <em>(he kneels, head bowed low)</em> He ordered me to kneel low, and, from the ground, like this, he ordered me to say: “Brutus is noble, wise, brave, and honest. Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Antony loves Brutus and honors him. Antony feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will swear that Antony may come to him safely and be convinced that Caesar deserved to be killed, Mark Antony will love dead Caesar not nearly as much as living Brutus, and with true faith he’ll follow the destiny and affairs of noble Brutus through the difficulties of this unprecedented state of affairs.” That’s what my master, Antony, says.</p>

People’s capacity for sympathy will grow tired and weak from the sheer quantity of cruel deeds.
