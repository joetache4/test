<p>Explaining government affairs always makes me talk excitedly. But since you know more about matters of government than I can ever tell you, the only thing left for me to say is this: rely on your natural ability, and let it work with your knowledge. You know as much, from both learning and experience, about the nature of our people, our city’s laws and procedures, and our legal system as anyone I can think of. Here are your written orders; do not deviate from them. <em>(to Attendants)</em> Go and order Angelo to come to me.</p>

<p>Angelo,</p>
<p>There is a kind of character in thy life,</p>
<p>That to the observer doth thy history</p>
<p>Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings</p>
<p>Are not thine own so proper as to waste</p>
<p>Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.</p>
<p>Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,</p>
<p>Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues</p>
<p>Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike</p>
<p>As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch’d</p>
<p>But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends</p>
<p>The smallest scruple of her excellence</p>
<p>But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines</p>
<p>Herself the glory of a creditor,</p>
<p>Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech</p>
<p>To one that can my part in him advertise;</p>
<p>Hold therefore, Angelo:—</p>
<p>In our remove be thou at full ourself;</p>
<p>Mortality and mercy in Vienna</p>
<p>Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,</p>
<p>Though first in question, is thy secondary.</p>
<p>Take thy commission.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b>
<p>Angelo, there is a distinctive pattern to your life that tells people what sort of man you are. But your talents don’t belong to you alone, and you mustn’t waste them by keeping them to yourself. Heaven uses us the way we use a torch—not to shine for itself, but to shed light onto the world. If we don’t use our talents in the world, it would be the same as if we didn’t have those talents at all. People are given certain natures to accomplish certain things. Mother Nature doesn’t lend you even a smidgen of talent without expecting you to pay her back—with interest and gratitude. But here I am talking to someone who could instruct me! So, stand firm, Angelo—in my absence, you’ll stand in for me completely. Vienna’s criminals will be executed or pardoned based on what you feel and say. Although old Escalus is senior to you, he’ll be your second-in-command. Take your written orders.</p>

<p>Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,</p>
<p>As time and our concernings shall importune,</p>
<p>How it goes with us, and do look to know</p>

<p>No more procrastinating. I’ve chosen you after careful consideration, so accept the honor. It’s imperative that I leave now, even if it means leaving some important matters undiscussed. I’ll write to you when I have the time and feel the need, telling you how I am, and I’ll expect to hear how you’re doing. So, goodbye; I’ll leave you to carry out your orders—successfully, no doubt.</p>

<p>Sorry, I’m in too big a rush. But please don’t have any doubts—you have all my authority to enforce or change the laws in any way that seems good to you. Let’s shake hands, and I’ll sneak off. I love the people but don’t like to parade before them. I don’t like their loud applause and emphatic cheering, though they can be politically useful; nor do I trust the judgment of any man who <em>does</em> desire such cheers and applause.
