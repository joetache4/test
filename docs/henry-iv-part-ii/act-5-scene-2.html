<b>PRINCE HENRY</b>
<p>This new and gorgeous robe of majesty doesn’t fit me as comfortably as you think. Brothers, your sadness is mixed with fear. This is the English court, not the Turkish one. I’m not Amurath, who had his brothers killed when he inherited his father King Amurath’s crown; I’m a Harry, following another Harry. But be sad, brothers, because truly, it suits you. You look so regal in your sorrow that I will solemnly put it on as well, and wear it in my heart. Be sad, but don’t let it be anything more than a burden we all share jointly. I want you to rest assured that as far as I’m concerned, I’ll be both your father and your brother now. Just trust me with your love, and you can trust me to care for you. Keep weeping for Harry, who is dead; I will, as well. But one Harry still lives, and he will convert those tears one by one into hours of happiness.</p>

<p>I then did use the person of your father;</p>

<p>Your Highness pleasèd to forget my place,</p>
<p>The majesty and power of law and justice,</p>
<p>The image of the King whom I presented,</p>
<p>And struck me in my very seat of judgment,</p>
<p>Whereon, as an offender to your father,</p>
<p>I gave bold way to my authority</p>
<p>And did commit you. If the deed were ill,</p>
<p>Be you contented, wearing now the garland,</p>
<p>To have a son set your decrees at nought?</p>
<p>To pluck down justice from your awful bench?</p>
<p>To trip the course of law and blunt the sword</p>
<p>That guards the peace and safety of your person?</p>
<p>Nay more, to spurn at your most royal image</p>
<p>And mock your workings in a second body?</p>
<p>Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;</p>
<p>Be now the father and propose a son,</p>
<p>Hear your own dignity so much profaned,</p>
<p>See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,</p>

<b>CHIEF JUSTICE</b>
<p>I acted with the authority of your father, whose power was vested in me. And when it came to the law—which I was busy enforcing, for the good of the country—you chose to ignore my rank, and the majesty and power of law and justice which I bore as a representative of the King. You struck me in the head, the very location of my judgment. With that action, you committed a crime against your father’s own laws. So I did what my power demanded, and imprisoned you. If that was wrong, then—now that you wear the crown—I hope you’ll someday be satisfied with a son who mocks your laws, who scorns the judges who rule in your authority, who disrupts the course of law, and blunts the swords that guard your personal peace and safety. No, even worse than that: a son who disrespects your deputies, and the officers you appoint in your name. Question yourself, and imagine being in your father’s position. Be a father, and imagine a son. Listen to your own dignity being profaned. Watch as your most solemn laws are laughed at so lightly. Behold yourself being so disdained by a son. And then imagine that I take your side, and that in your name I gently silence your son. Soberly consider this, and then pronounce my sentence. As king, tell me what I have done that was so unseemly for my station, myself, or my king’s authority.</p>

<b>PRINCE HENRY</b>
<p>You are right, justice, and you weigh this well.</p>
<p>Therefore still bear the balance and the sword.</p>
<p>And I do wish your honors may increase</p>
<p>Till you do live to see a son of mine</p>
<p>Offend you and obey you as I did.</p>
<p>So shall I live to speak my father’s words:</p>
<p>“Happy am I that have a man so bold</p>
<p>That dares do justice on my proper son;</p>
<p>And not less happy, having such a son</p>
<p>That would deliver up his greatness so</p>
<p>Into the hands of justice.” You did commit me,</p>
<p>For which I do commit into your hand</p>
<p>Th’ unstainèd sword that you have used to bear,</p>
<p>With this remembrance: that you use the same</p>
<p>With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit</p>
<p>As you have done ’gainst me. There is my hand.</p>
<p>You shall be as a father to my youth,</p>
<p>My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,</p>
<p>And I will stoop and humble my intents</p>
<p>To your well-practiced wise directions.—</p>
<p>And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you:</p>
<p>My father is gone wild into his grave,</p>
<p>For in his tomb lie my affections,</p>
<p>And with his spirit sadly I survive</p>
<p>To mock the expectation of the world,</p>
<p>To frustrate prophecies, and to raze out</p>
<p>Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down</p>
<p>After my seeming. The tide of blood in me</p>
<p>Hath proudly flowed in vanity till now.</p>
<p>Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,</p>
<p>Where it shall mingle with the state of floods</p>
<p>And flow henceforth in formal majesty.</p>
<p>Now call we our high court of parliament,</p>
</td>

<b>PRINCE HENRY</b>
<p>You’re right, Chief Justice, and you have considered this well. Therefore, keep your position as judge and enforcer. I hope that your honors increase, and that you live to see a son of mine offend and then obey you, as I have. I will live to speak my father’s words: “I am a happy man, to have a man brave enough to punish my own son; and I’m no less happy to have a son that would surrender his greatness, and put himself in the hands of the law.” You imprisoned me, and for that I charge you to continue in my service, with this reminder: you must always be as courageous, just, and impartial as you were with me. Shake my hand. You’ll be like a father to me, and I will say whatever it is you whisper in my ear. I will bow to you, and keep myself humble in the face of your wisdom and experience. And princes, believe me, please: my father lies wild in his grave, for he took my recklessness with him when he died. His sober spirit survives in me, and I will flout the world’s expectations. I will prove their prophecies false, and flush out the rotten opinions of those who judged me based on what I once seemed to be. My behavior, the tide of my blood, used to flow proudly and vainly. But now, it ebbs and turns back toward the sea, where it will mingle with the ocean’s majesty and flow back through my body with formal dignity. Now I will assemble my parliament, and choose such noble officers and advisors that our great country will be able to march alongside the best governed nations. We’ll become acquainted and familiar</p>
