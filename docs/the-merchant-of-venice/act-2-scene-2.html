<p>Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew, my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me, “Gobbo,” “Launcelot Gobbo,” “Good Launcelot,” or “Good Gobbo,” or “Good Launcelot Gobbo” —“use your legs, take the start, run away.” My conscience says, “No. Take heed, honest Launcelot. Take heed, honest Gobbo,” or as aforesaid, “Honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not run. Scorn running with thy heels.” Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. “Fia!” says the fiend. “Away!” says the fiend. “For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend, “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, “My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to. He had a kind of taste.—Well, my conscience says, “Launcelot, budge not.” “Budge!” says the fiend. “Budge not,” says my conscience. “Conscience,” say I, “you counsel well.” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.” To be ruled by my conscience I should stay with the Jew my master, who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil. And to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation. And in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel. I will run, fiend. My heels are at your command. I will run.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>LAUNCELOT</b>
<p>I’m sure I’ll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew, my master. The devil’s on my shoulder, tempting me. He’s saying, “Gobbo,” “Launcelot Gobbo,” “Good Launcelot,” or “Good Gobbo,” or “Good Launcelot Gobbo”—“use your legs and run away.” But my conscience says, “No, Launcelot, calm down, don’t run away.” The devil’s urging me to leave. “Go away!” he says. “Run away! Be tough,” says the devil, “and run!” But then my conscience, hanging around my heart, says very wisely to me, “My good friend Launcelot, you’re a good boy, the son of an honest man,” really, that should be the son of an honest woman, since my father cheated on my mother. Anyway, my conscience says, “Stay put.” “Go,” the devil says. “Don’t go,” says my conscience. “Conscience,” I say, “you give good advice.” “Devil,” I say, “you give good advice.” If I listened to my conscience, I’d stay with the Jew my master, who’s a devil. But if I ran away from the Jew, I’d be following the advice of the devil, who’s the very devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the devil incarnate, and my conscience is giving me a hard time by telling me to stay with the Jew. The devil’s advice is nicer. I’ll run, devil. Tell me to run, and I’ll run.</p>

<p>Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano.</p>
<p>Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice—</p>
<p>Parts that become thee happily enough</p>
<p>And in such eyes as ours appear not faults.</p>
<p>But where thou art not known, why, there they show</p>
<p>Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain</p>
<p>To allay with some cold drops of modesty</p>
<p>Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior</p>
<p>I be misconst’red in the place I go to,</p>
<p>And lose my hopes.</p>

<b>BASSANIO</b>
<p>Well, if you have to go, you have to go. But listen to me, Gratiano. Sometimes you get a bit too wild, and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude. These things look good on you, of course, and to people like you and me there’s nothing wrong with it. But in places where people don’t know you, your behavior might seem too wild. Please, try to act a little more serious, or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about me, and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia.</p>

<p>Signor Bassanio, hear me.</p>
<p>If I do not put on a sober habit,</p>
<p>Talk with respect and swear but now and then,</p>
<p>Wear prayer books in my pocket, look demurely—</p>
<p>Nay more. While grace is saying, hood mine eyes</p>
<p>Thus with my hat, and sigh and say, “Amen”—</p>
<p>Use all the observance of civility</p>
<p>Like one well studied in a sad ostent</p>
<p>To please his grandam, never trust me more.</p>

<b>GRATIANO</b>
<p>Listen, Signor Bassanio, there’s nothing to worry about. I’ll be solemn-looking, I’ll talk with respect, and I’ll only swear once in a while. I’ll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet—even more. While grace is being said, I’ll be modest and say “amen”—I’ll watch my manners as if I’m trying to please my grandma. If I don’t do all this, never trust me again.</p>

<p>No, it’d be a shame for you to act serious tonight. I’d rather see you having fun, because we have friends coming who want to have fun. Anyway, I have to say goodbye to you now. I’ve got some business to take care of.</p>
