<p>Nay, but this dotage of our general’s</p>
<p>O’erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,</p>
<p>That o’er the files and musters of the war</p>
<p>Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn</p>
<p>The office and devotion of their view</p>
<p>Upon a tawny front. His captain’s heart,</p>
<p>Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst</p>
<p>The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper</p>
<p>And is become the bellows and the fan</p>
<p>To cool a gypsy’s lust.</p>

<b>PHILO</b>
<p>No, our general’s infatuation is out of control. His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops. Now his eyes devote themselves exclusively to a certain brown-skinned face. His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights, but now he’s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore.</p>

<p>Nay, hear them, Antony.</p>

<p>Where’s Fulvia’s process? Caesar’s, I would say—both?</p>
<p>Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt’s queen,</p>

<b>CLEOPATRA</b>
<p>Maybe? No, most likely. You can’t stay here any longer. Caesar has sent your dismissal, so pay attention, Antony. Where’s Fulvia’s summons—excuse me, I should have said Caesar’s. Or do Fulvia and Caesar both beckon you back to Rome? Call in the messengers and we’ll find out. As surely as I am the queen of Egypt, Antony, you’re blushing, which means you’re Caesar’s servant. Or that that bitch Fulvia still has the power to humiliate you. Call the messengers!</p>

<p>Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch</p>
<p>Of the ranged empire fall. Here is my space.</p>
<p>Kingdoms are clay. Our dungy earth alike</p>
<p>Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life</p>
<p>Is to do thus, when such a mutual pair</p>
<p>And such a twain can do ’t, in which I bind,</p>
<p>On pain of punishment, the world to weet</p>
<p>We stand up peerless.</p>
</td>

<b>ANTONY</b>
<p>Let Rome be washed away in the Tiber and let the great empire fall. My place is here. Kingdoms are only dirt. The soil feeds animals as well as people, so how does having a kingdom separate humans from beasts? The noblest thing is to do what we’re doing, particularly when the couple is as well matched as we are. I demand that the world admit we are the perfect couple or else suffer the consequences.</p>
