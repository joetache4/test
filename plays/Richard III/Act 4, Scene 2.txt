    m:
      - "Because of your advice and your help, I have a high position now. But will I wear these honors for only a day or will I enjoy them for a long time?"

    o:

      - "Young Edward lives; think now what I would speak."
    m:
      - "Oh Buckingham, now I’m going to test to see if you’re truly made of gold. Young Prince Edward is still alive—what do you think I’m going to say next?"

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "Say on, my loving lord."
    m:
      - "Go on, my loving lord."

    o:
      - "  O bitter consequence"
      - "That Edward still should live “true noble prince”!"
      - "Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull."
      - "Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead,"
      - "And I would have it suddenly performed."
      - "What sayest thou now? Speak suddenly. Be brief."
    m:
      - "Oh, how bitter it is that Edward—the real “true, noble prince”—should still be alive! Cousin, you didn’t used to be so thickheaded. Shall I put it plainly? I want the bastards dead. And I want it done right away. What do you say? Speak now and to the point."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "Your Grace may do your pleasure."

      - "Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?"
    m:
      - "Tut, tut, you’ve become rather icy. Your friendliness toward me seems to be freezing over. Tell me, do I have your consent to kill them?"

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "Give me some little breath, some pause, dear lord,"
      - "Before I positively speak in this."
      - "I will resolve you herein presently."
    m:

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "*(aside)* I will converse with iron-witted fools"
      - "And unrespective boys. None are for me"
      - "That look into me with considerate eyes."
      - "High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.—"
      - "Boy!"
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* I only want to deal with stupid fools and careless boys. I have no use for people who look at me insightfully. Ambitious Buckingham grows much too circumspect. Boy!"

  - sp: PAGE
    o:
      - "*(coming forward)* My lord?"
    m:
      - "My lord?"

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Know’st thou not any whom corrupting gold"
      - "Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?"
    m:
      - "Do you know anyone who would kill someone for money?"

  - sp: PAGE
    o:
      - "I know a discontented gentleman"
      - "Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit."
      - "Gold were as good as twenty orators,"
      - "And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything."
    m:
      - "My lord, I know one unhappy gentleman who has more pride than money. Money talks, and would very likely get him to do anything."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "What is his name?"
    m:
      - "What’s his name?"

  - sp: PAGE
    o:

    m:
      - "His name is Tyrrel, my lord."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "I partly know the man. Go, call him hither, boy"
    m:
      - "I know the man a bit. Go, bring him here, boy."

  - os: "Exit PAGE"
    ms: "The PAGE exits."

  - o:
      - "*(aside)* The deep-revolving witty Buckingham"
      - "No more shall be the neighbor to my counsels"
      - "Hath he so long held out with me, untired,"
      - "And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so."
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* The thoughtful, witty Buckingham will no longer be privy to my innermost thoughts. Has he held out for me for so long and without a moment’s doubt only to suddenly need some “breathing room”? Well, so be it."

  - os: "Enter STANLEY"
    ms: "STANLEY enters."

  - o:
      - "How now, Lord Stanley, what’s the news?"
    m:
      - "Look who’s here! What’s the news with you?"

  - sp: STANLEY
    o:
      - "Know, my long lord,"
      - "The marquess Dorset, as I hear, is fled"
      - "To Richmond, in the parts where he abides."
    m:
      - "You should know, my loving lord, I’ve heard that the marquess Dorset has fled to Brittany, to the earl of Richmond."

  - os: "He walks aside"
    ms: "He stands aside."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Come hither, Catesby. Rumor it abroad"
      - "That Anne my wife is very grievous sick."
      - "I will take order for her keeping close."
      - "Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,"
      - "Whom I will marry straight to Clarence’ daughter."
      - "The boy is foolish, and I fear not him."
      - "Look how thou dream’st! I say again, give out"
      - "That Anne my queen is sick and like to die."
      - "About it, for it stands me much upon"
      - "To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me."
    m:
      - "Come here, Catesby. Spread the rumor abroad that Anne, my wife, is very sick. I will make sure she’s kept out of view. And find a poverty stricken gentleman who I can marry straightaway to Clarence’s daughter. Clarence’s son is dull-witted, so I’m not worried about him. Look at you, standing there in a stupor! I repeat, spread the rumor that Anne, my wife, is sick and likely to die. Hurry up because it’s absolutely crucial that I destroy anything that may damage my position."

  - os: "Exit CATESBY"
    ms: "CATESBY exits."

  - o:
      - "*(aside)* I must be married to my brother’s daughter,"
      - "Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass."
      - "Murder her brothers, and then marry her—"
      - "Uncertain way of gain. But I am in"
      - "So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin."
      - "Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye."
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* I must get married to my brother’s daughter. Otherwise, my kingdom stands on glass. Murdering her brothers and then marrying her isn’t the most foolproof way to secure my position. But I’m steeped so deep in blood by now that one sin has to follow the next. I have no tears of pity for anyone."

  - os: "Enter PAGE with TYRREL"
    ms: "The PAGE returns with TYRREL."

  - o:
      - "Is thy name Tyrrel?"
    m:

  - sp: TYRREL
    o:
      - "James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject."
    m:
      - "James Tyrrel—and your most obedient subject."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Art thou indeed?"
    m:
      - "Are you indeed?"

  - sp: TYRREL
    o:

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Dar’st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?"
    m:
      - "Do you dare kill a friend of mine?"

  - sp: TYRREL
    o:
      - "Please you. But I had rather kill two enemies."
    m:
      - "Yes, my lord, but I’d rather kill two enemies."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Why then, thou hast it. Two deep enemies,"
      - "Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep’s disturbers,"
      - "Are they that I would have thee deal upon."
      - "Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower."
    m:
      - "Well, that’s what you get to do. Two great enemies, in fact, enemies to my peace of mind. Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower."

  - sp: TYRREL
    o:
      - "Let me have open means to come to them,"
      - "And soon I’ll rid you from the fear of them."
    m:
      - "Give me access to them, and soon you won’t have to worry about them anymore."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Thou sing’st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel."
    m:
      - "That’s music to my ears. Come here, Tyrrel."

  - os: "TYRREL approaches RICHARD and kneels"
    ms: "TYRREL approaches RICHARD and kneels."

  - o:
      - "Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear."
    m:

  - os: "He whispers"
    ms: "RICHARD whispers to TYRREL."

  - o:
      - "There is no more but so. Say it is done,"
      - "And I will love thee and prefer thee for it."
    m:
      - "That’s all there is to it. As soon as the deed is done, you will be in my favor and I will promote you."

  - sp: TYRREL
    o:
      - "I will dispatch it straight."
    m:
      - "I’ll do it right away."

  - os: "Exit"

    ms: "BUCKINGHAM returns."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "My lord, I have considered in my mind"
      - "The late request that you did sound me in."
    m:
      - "My lord, I have thought over the request you just made of me."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to Richmond."
    m:
      - "Well, it doesn’t matter anymore. Dorset has fled to the earl of Richmond."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "I hear the news, my lord."
    m:
      - "I heard the news, my lord."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Stanley, he is your wife’s son. Well, look unto it."
    m:
      - "Stanley, Richmond is your wife’s son. Get information from her."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,"
      - "For which your honor and your faith is pawned—"
      - "Th’ earldom of Hereford and the movables"
      - "Which you promisèd I shall possess."
    m:
      - "My lord, I’d want to have the gift you promised me on your honor: the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Stanley, look to your wife. If she convey"
      - "Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it."
    m:
      - "Stanley, pay attention to your wife’s doings. If she sends any letters to Richmond, you will be accountable to me for it."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "What says your Highness to my just request?"
    m:
      - "What do you say, your Highness, about my just request?"

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "I do remember me, Henry the Sixth"
      - "Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,"
      - "When Richmond was a little peevish boy."
      - "A king, perhaps—"
    m:
      - "As I remember, Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond would be king when Richmond was only a foolish little boy. A king, perhaps—"

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "My lord—"
    m:
      - "My lord—"

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "How chance the prophet could not at that time"
      - "Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?"
    m:
      - "How is it that the prophet didn’t tell me at the time that I would kill him?"

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "My lord, your promise for the earldom—"
    m:
      - "My lord, your promise of the earldom—"

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,"
      - "The mayor in courtesy showed me the castle"
      - "And called it Rougemont, at which name I started,"
      - "Because a bard of Ireland told me once"
      - "I should not live long after I saw Richmond."
    m:
      - "Richmond! The last time I was in Exeter, the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it “Rougemont.” The name startled me because an Irish poet once told me that I would die soon after seeing “Richmond.”"

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "My Lord—"
    m:
      - "My lord!"

    m:
      - "It’s almost ten o’clock."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Well, let it strike."
    m:
      - "Well, let it strike ten then."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "Why let it strike?"
    m:
      - "Why “let it strike”?"

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Because that, like a jack, thou keep’st the stroke"
      - "Betwixt thy begging and my meditation."
      - "I am not in the giving vein today."
    m:
      - "Because you’re like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bell—you keep interrupting my thoughts. I am not in the giving mood today."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "Why then, resolve me whether you will or no."
    m:
      - "Well, then, let me know whether you will give me the earldom some other time."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein."
    m:

  - os: "Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM"
    ms: "Everyone except BUCKINGHAM exits."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "And is it thus? Repays he my deep service"
      - "With such deep contempt? Made I him king for this?"
      - "O, let me think on Hastings and be gone"
      - "To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!"
    m:
      - "Is this really happening? Does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt? Did I work to make him king for this? Oh, let me remember what happened to Hastings and hurry to Brecknock while I still have my head on my shoulders!"

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."
