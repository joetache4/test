Then he would restrain himself from committing such a wrong. What subject can pass judgment on his king? And who here isn’t Richard’s subject? Even thieves aren’t judged unless they’re present, even when they’re obviously guilty. Shall the image of God’s majesty, who is His chosen deputy and caretaker and has been so for many years, be judged by his inferiors without even being present? Oh, God, don’t allow such refined souls in a Christian land to be so obscene. I’m speaking to subjects as a subject, because I’ve been moved by God to speak boldly for his king. You might call my Lord of Hereford here king, but he is a traitor to his king. If you give him the crown, I predict that the blood of the English will soak the soil, and future generations will regret this act. Peace will leave England and go to the Turks and infidels, while we will have terrible wars that will pit families against each other. Disorder, fear, mutiny, and horror will live here, and it will be known as a place of terror and skulls. If you pit your family against his, it will prove to be the worst division ever to take place on earth. Prevent it from happening.

<b>KING RICHARD II</b>
<p>Give me the crown. Here, cousin, take the crown. Here cousin. I’ll put my hand on this side of it, and you put yours on the other. Now this golden crown looks like a well that has two buckets, and raising one causes the other to drop and fill up. One is empty and dances up in the air, while the other is down in the well and full of water. I’m the bucket at the bottom, full of tears, and you are the one risen to the top.</p>

I’ll give you this heavy crown from my head, and this scepter from my hand. I’ll take the pride of being king out of my heart. My own tears will wash away the oil that made me king. My own hands will give away the crown. My own tongue will deny my sacred right to be king. My own breath will give up all oaths of allegiance made to me. I give up all the ritual and ceremony, all my homes, my income, and reject all the laws I enacted. May God pardon everyone who breaks his oath to me! May God keep them from breaking their oath to you! Let me grieve for nothing since I have nothing, and let you be pleased with everything since you have everything! May you live long in my place, and let me be buried soon! God save King Harry, former King Richard says, and let him have many happy days! What else is left?</p>
