<p>Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at</p>
<p>Coriolanus’ exile. Now he’s coming;</p>
<p>And not a hair upon a soldier’s head</p>
<p>Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs</p>
<p>As you threw caps up will he tumble down,</p>
<p>And pay you for your voices. ’Tis no matter;</p>

<p>We have deserved it.</p>

<p>Here come the crowds. Is Aufidius with him? You’re the ones that made the air unwholesome when you tossed up your stinking greasy caps, hooting at Coriolanus’ exile. Now he’s coming, and there’s not a hair on a soldier’s head that won’t become a whip. He’ll cut off every fool’s head that had tossed up a hat to repay you for your votes. If he could burn us all into one coal, we would deserve it.</p>
