  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight."
      - "Let’s teach ourselves that honorable stop"
      - "Not to outsport discretion."
    m:
      - "Good Michael, keep a careful eye on the guards tonight. Let’s exercise restraint and not let the party get too wild."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Iago hath direction what to do,"
      - "But notwithstanding with my personal eye"
      - "Will I look to ’t."
    m:
      - "Iago has orders what to do. But I’ll see to it personally anyway."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    Iago is most honest."
      - "Michael, good night. Tomorrow with your earliest"
      - "Let me have speech with you.—"
      - "Come, my dear love,"
      - "The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue:"
      - "That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you."
      - "Good night."
    m:
      - "Iago’s a good man. Goodnight, Michael. Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can.—Come with me, my dear love. Now that the wedding’s over, we can have the pleasure of consummating our marriage. Good night, everyone."

  - os: "Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and attendants"
    ms: "OTHELLO and DESDEMONA exit with their attendants."

  - os: "Enter IAGO"
    ms: "IAGO enters."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Welcome, Iago. We must to the watch."
    m:
      - "Hello, Iago. It’s time for us to stand guard."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Not this hour, lieutenant, ’tis not yet ten o’ the clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona—who let us not therefore blame. He hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and she is sport for Jove."
    m:
      - "Not yet, lieutenant. It’s not even ten o’clock. The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona.—I can’t blame him. He hasn’t spent the night with her yet, and she’s beautiful enough to be Jove’s lover."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "She’s a most exquisite lady."
    m:
      - "She’s an exquisitely beautiful lady."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "And, I’ll warrant her, full of game."
    m:
      - "And I bet she’s good in bed too."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Indeed she’s a most fresh and delicate creature."
    m:
      - "Yes, she’s young and tender."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to provocation."
    m:
      - "And such pretty eyes! Like an invitation."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "An inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest."
    m:
      - "Yes, she’s pretty. But she’s modest and ladylike too."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?"
    m:
      - "And when she speaks, doesn’t her voice stir up passion?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "She is indeed perfection."
    m:
      - "She’s a perfect woman, it’s true."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine, and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello."
    m:
      - "Well, good luck to them tonight in bed! Come with us, lieutenant. I’ve got a jug of wine, and these two Cyprus gentlemen want to drink a toast to the black Othello."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment."
    m:
      - "Not tonight, Iago. I’m not much of a drinker. I wish there was less social pressure to drink."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Oh, they are our friends. But one cup. I’ll drink for you."
    m:
      - "Oh, but these are our friends. Just one glass. I’ll do most of the drinking for you."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here. I am unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more."
    m:
      - "I’ve already had a glass of wine tonight, watered down, but look how drunk I am. I’m not a heavy drinker. I wouldn’t dare drink much more than that."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "What, man, ’tis a night of revels! The gallants desire it."
    m:
      - "What are you talking about, man? Tonight is for celebrating! The gentlemen are waiting."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Where are they?"
    m:
      - "Where are they?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Here at the door. I pray you call them in."
    m:
      - "By the door. Please invite them in."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "I’ll do ’t, but it dislikes me."
    m:
      - "I’ll do it, but I don’t like it."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "CASSIO exits."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "If I can fasten but one cup upon him,"
      - "With that which he hath drunk tonight already,"
      - "He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense"
      - "As my young mistress’ dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,"
      - "Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out,"
      - "To Desdemona hath tonight caroused"
      - "Potations pottle-deep, and he’s to watch."
      - "Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits"
      - "(That hold their honors in a wary distance,"
      - "The very elements of this warlike isle)"
      - "Have I tonight flustered with flowing cups,"
      - "And they watch too. Now ’mongst this flock of drunkards"
      - "Am I to put our Cassio in some action"
      - "That may offend the isle."
      - "    But here they come."
      - "If consequence do but approve my dream"
      - "My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream."
    m:
      - "If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he’s drunk already, he’ll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog. That fool Roderigo, all twisted up inside with love, has been drinking toasts to Desdemona by the gallon, and he’s on guard duty.I’ve gotten the rest of the guards drunk, as well as several gentlemen from Cyprus who are quick to take offense. Now I’ll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island. Here they come. If the future turns out as I hope it will, I’m all set for success."

  - os: "Enter CASSIO, MONTANO and gentlemen"
    ms: "CASSIO, MONTANO, and GENTLEMEN enter, followed by servants with wine."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "’Fore heaven, they have given me a rouse already."
    m:
      - "My God, they’ve given me a lot to drink."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "Good faith, a little one, not past a pint, As I am a soldier."
    m:
      - "No, it was a little one, not more than a pint."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "    Some wine, ho!"
      - "*(sings)*"
      - "*And let me the cannikin clink, clink,*"
      - "*And let me the cannikin clink.*"
      - "*A soldier’s a man,*"
      - "*A life’s but a span,*"
      - "*Why then let a soldier drink.*"
      - "*Some wine, boys!*"
    m:
      - "Bring in more wine!"
      - "*(he sings)*"
      - "*And clink your glasses together*,"
      - "*And clink your glasses together*."
      - "*A soldier’s a man*,"
      - "*And a man’s life is short*,"
      - "*So let the soldier drink*."
      - "*Have some more wine, boys!*"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Fore heaven, an excellent song."
    m:
      - "My God, what a great song!"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting. Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander—Drink, ho!—are nothing to your English."
    m:
      - "I learned it England, where they have a talent for drinking. The Danes, the Germans, and the Dutch—come on, drink, drink!—are nothing compared to the English."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?"
    m:
      - "Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain. He gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled."
    m:
      - "They drink Danes under the table, and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans. And the Dutch are vomiting while the English are asking for refills."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "To the health of our general!"
    m:
      - "Let’s drink to our general!"

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "I am for it, lieutenant, and I’ll do you justice."
    m:
      - "Hear, hear! I’ll drink as much as you do!"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Oh, sweet England!"
      - "*(sings)*"
      - "*King Stephen was a worthy peer,*"
      - "*His breeches cost him but a crown,*"
      - "*He held them sixpence all too dear,*"
      - "*With that he called the tailor lown.*"
      - "*He was a wight of high renown,*"
      - "*And thou art but of low degree,*"
      - "*’Tis pride that pulls the country down,*"
      - "*Then take thine auld cloak about thee.*"
      - "*Some wine, ho!*"
    m:
      - "Oh, sweet England!"
      - "*(he sings)*"
      - "  *King Stephen was a good king, and his pants were very cheap*,"
      - "  *But he thought his tailor overcharged him, so he called him a peasant*."
      - "  *And that was a man of noble rank, much higher than you are*."
      - "  *So be happy with your worn-out cloak*,"
      - "  *Since pride is ruining the nation*."
      - "  *More wine!*"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other."
    m:
      - "God, that song’s even better than the other one."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Will you hear ’t again?"
    m:
      - "Do you want to hear it again?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things. Well, heaven’s above all, and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved."
    m:
      - "No, because we shouldn’t be doing that—stuff. Oh well, God’s in charge, and some people have to go to heaven, while other people have to go to hell."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "It’s true, good lieutenant."
    m:
      - "That’s true, lieutenant."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "For mine own part, no offence to the general nor any man of quality, I hope to be saved."
    m:
      - "Speaking for myself—and no offense to the general or anyone else—I hope I’m going to heaven."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "And so do I too, lieutenant."
    m:
      - "Me too, lieutenant."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Ay, but (by your leave) not before me. The lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let’s have no more of this, let’s to our affairs.—Forgive us our sins!—Gentlemen, let’s look to our business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk. This is my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not drunk now. I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough."
    m:
      - "Okay, but please not before me. The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign. But let’s stop this drinking and get down to business.—God forgive our sins!—Gentlemen, let’s get down to business. By the way, I don’t want anyone thinking I’m drunk. This is my ensign. This is my right hand, and this is my left hand. I’m not drunk. I can stand well enough, and I can speak just fine."

  - sp: ALL
    o:
      - "Excellent well!"
    m:
      - "Yes, you’re speaking very well."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Why, very well then. You must not think then that I am drunk."
    m:
      - "Yes, very well. So don’t think that I’m drunk."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "CASSIO exits."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "To th’ platform, masters. Come, let’s set the watch."
    m:
      - "Let’s go to the platform where we’ll stand guard. Come on."

  - os: "Exit GENTLEMEN"
    ms: "GENTLEMEN exit."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "You see this fellow that is gone before,"
      - "He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar"
      - "And give direction. And do but see his vice,"
      - "’Tis to his virtue a just equinox,"
      - "The one as long as th’ other. ’Tis pity of him."
      - "I fear the trust Othello puts him in"
      - "On some odd time of his infirmity"
      - "Will shake this island."
    m:
      - "You see that man who just left? He’s a good soldier, good enough to be Caesar’s right-hand man. But he has a serious weakness. It’s too bad. I’m worried that Othello trusts him too much, and it’ll be bad for Cyprus eventually."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "    But is he often thus?"
    m:
      - "But is he often like this?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "’Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep."
      - "He’ll watch the horologe a double set"
      - "If drink rock not his cradle."
    m:
      - "He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep. He’d stay up all night and all day if he didn’t drink himself to sleep."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "    It were well"
      - "The general were put in mind of it."
      - "Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature"
      - "Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio"
      - "And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?"
    m:
      - "The general should be informed about this. Maybe he’s never noticed, or he only wants to see Cassio’s good side. Don’t you think so?"

  - os: "Enter RODERIGO"
    ms: "RODERIGO enters."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "*(aside)* How now, Roderigo?"
      - "I pray you, after the lieutenant, go!"
    m:

    o:
      - "And ’tis great pity that the noble Moor"
      - "Should hazard such a place as his own second"
      - "With one of an ingraft infirmity."
      - "It were an honest action to say"
      - "So to the Moor."
    m:
      - "And it’s too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command. We should definitely say something to the Moor."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "    Not I, for this fair island."
      - "I do love Cassio well, and would do much"
      - "To cure him of this evil—"
    m:
      - "I wouldn’t say anything, not if you gave me the whole island for doing so. I respect Cassio and I’d like to help cure his alcoholism—"

  - os: "Cry within “Help! help!”"
    ms: "A voice offstage calls “Help! Help!”"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:

    m:
      - "What’s that noise?"

  - os: "Enter CASSIO, pursuing RODERIGO"
    ms: "CASSIO enters, chasing RODERIGO."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Zounds! You rogue! You rascal!"
    m:
      - "Damn you, you villain, you rascal!"

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "What’s the matter, lieutenant?"
    m:
      - "What’s the matter, lieutenant?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "A knave teach me my duty?"
      - "I’ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle."
    m:
      - "To think that fool had the nerve to try to teach me manners! I’ll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave!"

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "Nay, good lieutenant! I pray you, sir, hold your hand. *(stays him)*"
    m:

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:

    m:
      - "Stop! Lieutenant—sir, Montano—gentlemen! Have you forgotten your duty and your sense of decorum? Stop! The general is talking to you! Stop, for God’s sake!"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Why, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this?"
      - "Are we turned Turks? And to ourselves do that"
      - "Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?"
      - "For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl."

      - "Honest Iago, that looks dead with grieving,"
      - "Speak, who began this? On thy love, I charge thee."
    m:
      - "How did this all start? Have we all become as savage as the Turks, treating each other as badly as they would have treated us? For heaven’s sake, stop this savage brawl! The next man who swings his sword must not care about his life, because the instant he strikes, he dies. Stop that alarm from ringing, it’s scaring the islanders. What’s the matter here, gentlemen?—Honest Iago, you look upset. Speak up and tell me who started this. Answer me."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "I do not know. Friends all but now, even now,"
      - "In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom"
      - "Divesting them for bed. And then, but now,"
      - "As if some planet had unwitted men,"
      - "Swords out, and tilting one at other’s breasts"
      - "In opposition bloody. I cannot speak"
      - "Any beginning to this peevish odds,"
      - "And would in action glorious I had lost"
      - "Those legs that brought me to a part of it."
    m:
      - "I don’t know. We were all having fun until just a minute ago; we were as happy as a bride and groom taking off their clothes. But then the mood suddenly changed. It was as if something had driven the men insane and made them point their swords at one another. I don’t know what could have started this. I’d rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this!"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?"
    m:
      - "How did you manage to lose your self-control like this, Michael?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:

      - "The world hath noted, and your name is great"
      - "In mouths of wisest censure. What’s the matter"
      - "That you unlace your reputation thus"
      - "And spend your rich opinion for the name"
      - "Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it."
    m:
      - "Montano, you’re supposed to be calm and collected. You’re famous for it. Wise people respect you. What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler? Tell me."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger."
      - "Your officer Iago can inform you,"
      - "While I spare speech, which something now offends me,"

This gentleman stopped Cassio and told him to put away his sword. I followed the guy who was crying for help, to keep him from scaring the public. But he was fast and outran me. When I got back, I heard the swords clinking and Cassio swearing. I’d never heard him swear before. They were nearly killing each other, as you saw when you pulled them apart. I can’t tell you anything else. But nobody’s perfect, and even the best man sometimes loses control and strikes out in rage. Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano, who was only trying to help him, but I’m sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way, and Cassio couldn’t let it pass."

How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what’ll do him good? That’s the kind of argument you’d expect from Satan! When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces, just like I’m doing now. And while this fool is begging Desdemona to help him, and while she’s pleading his case to the Moor, I’ll poison the Moor’s ear against her, hinting that she’s taking Cassio’s side because of her lust for him.
