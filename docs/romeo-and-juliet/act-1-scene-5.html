<b>JULIET</b>
<p><em>(aside)</em> My only love sprung from my only hate!</p>
<p>Too early seen unknown, and known too late!</p>
<p>Prodigious birth of love it is to me,</p>
<p>That I must love a loathèd enemy.</p>

<b>JULIET</b>
<p><em>(to herself)</em> The only man I love is the son of the only man I hate! I saw him too early without knowing who he was, and I found out who he was too late! Love is a monster for making me fall in love with my worst enemy.</p>
