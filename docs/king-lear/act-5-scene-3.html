<p>Sir, I decided it was appropriate to send the pathetic old king to a guarded prison cell. His old age and his title make him so popular among the commoners that I was worried our enlisted soldiers would turn against us on his behalf. I sent the French queen with him too, for the same reason. They’re ready to meet with you tomorrow, or whenever you like, wherever you’d like to hold your hearing. These are difficult times. Many have lost friends in battle, and soldiers will curse even a justified war if it causes them pain. We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father.</p>

<p>Normally I would ask you what your name is first.

I throw your accusations back in your face. Your lies can hardly hurt me, but I’ll still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart.—Trumpets, blow!</p>

I became his guide, I led him and begged for him, and kept him from suicide. I never—oh, what a mistake!—revealed myself to him until half an hour ago, when I was in my armor. With hope in my heart I asked him for his blessing, not sure that he’d give it to me. He did. I told him everything that had happened on my journey. But his frail heart, too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness, gave out.</p>
