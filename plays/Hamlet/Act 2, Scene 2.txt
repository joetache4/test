    o:
      - "Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern."
      - "Moreover that we much did long to see you,"
      - "The need we have to use you did provoke"
      - "Our hasty sending. Something have you heard"
      - "Of Hamlet’s “transformation”—so call it"
      - "Since nor th’ exterior nor the inward man"
      - "Resembles that it was. What it should be,"
      - "More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him"
      - "So much from th’ understanding of himself,"
      - "I cannot dream of. I entreat you both"
      - "That, being of so young days brought up with him"
      - "And since so neighbored to his youth and ’havior,"
      - "That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court"
      - "Some little time so by your companies"
      - "To draw him on to pleasures and to gather,"
      - "So much as from occasion you may glean,"
      - "Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus"
      - "That, opened, lies within our remedy."
    m:
      - "Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. I’ve wanted to see you for a long time now, but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away. You’ve probably heard about the “change” that’s come over Hamlet—that’s the only word for it, since inside and out he’s different from what he was before. I can’t imagine what’s made him so unlike himself, other than his father’s death. Since you both grew up with him and are so familiar with his personality and behavior, I’m asking you to stay a while at court and spend some time with him. See if you can get Hamlet to have some fun, and find out if there’s anything in particular that’s bothering him, so we can set about trying to fix it."

  - sp: GERTRUDE
    o:
      - "Good gentlemen, he hath much talked of you."
      - "And sure I am two men there are not living"
      - "To whom he more adheres. If it will please you"
      - "To show us so much gentry and good will"
      - "As to expend your time with us awhile"
      - "For the supply and profit of our hope,"
      - "Your visitation shall receive such thanks"
      - "As fits a king’s remembrance."
    m:
      - "Gentlemen, Hamlet’s talked a lot about you, and I know there are no two men alive he’s fonder of. If you’ll be so good as to spend some time with us and help us out, you’ll be thanked on a royal scale."

  - sp: ROSENCRANTZ
    o:
      - "    Both your majesties"
      - "Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,"
      - "Put your dread pleasures more into command"
      - "Than to entreaty."
    m:
      - "Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command, instead of asking us so politely."

  - sp: GUILDENSTERN
    o:
      - "  But we both obey"
      - "And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,"
      - "To lay our service freely at your feet"
      - "To be commanded."
    m:
      - "But we’ll obey. Our services are entirely at your command."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:

    o:

      - "My too much changèd son. Go, some of you,"
      - "And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is."
    m:
      - "Thanks, Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz. I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son, who’s changed too much. Servants, take these gentlemen to see Hamlet."

  - sp: GUILDENSTERN
    o:
      - "Heavens make our presence and our practices"

      - "Hunts not the trail of policy so sure"
      - "As it hath used to do—that I have found"
      - "The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy."
    m:
      - "Do I, sir? I assure your majesty I’m only doing my duty both to my God and my good king. And I believe—unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be—that I’ve found out why Hamlet’s gone crazy."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "Oh, speak of that. That do I long to hear."
    m:
      - "Tell me! I want very much to find out."

    o:
      - "Give first admittance to th’ ambassadors."
      - "My news shall be the fruit to that great feast."
    m:
      - "All right, but first let the ambassadors speak. Then you can hear my news, as dessert."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:

  - sp: GERTRUDE
    o:
      - "I doubt it is no other but the main:"
      - "His father’s death and our o’erhasty marriage."
    m:

      - "Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?"
    m:
      - "Well, we’ll get to the bottom of it. Welcome, my good friends. Tell me, Voltemand, what’s the news from the king of Norway?"

  - sp: VOLTEMAND
    o:
      - "Most fair return of greetings and desires."
      - "Upon our first, he sent out to suppress"
      - "His nephew’s levies, which to him appeared"
      - "To be a preparation ’gainst the Polack,"
      - "But, better looked into, he truly found"
      - "It was against your highness. Whereat grieved—"
      - "That so his sickness, age, and impotence"
      - "Was falsely borne in hand—sends out arrests"
      - "On Fortinbras, which he, in brief, obeys,"
      - "Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine"
      - "Makes vow before his uncle never more"
      - "To give th’ assay of arms against your majesty."
      - "Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,"
      - "Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee"
      - "And his commission to employ those soldiers,"
      - "So levied as before, against the Polack,"
      - "With an entreaty, herein further shown,"
      - "That it might please you to give quiet pass"
      - "Through your dominions for this enterprise,"
      - "On such regards of safety and allowance"
      - "As therein are set down. *(gives CLAUDIUS a document)*"
    m:
      - "Greetings to you too, your Highness. As soon as we raised the matter, the king sent out messengers to stop his nephew’s war preparations, which he originally thought were directed against Poland but learned on closer examination were directed against you. He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him, and he ordered Fortinbras’ arrest. Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again. The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand crowns and permission to lead his soldiers into Poland, asking you officially in this letter to allow his troops to pass through your kingdom on their way to Poland. He’s assuring you of your safety. *(he gives CLAUDIUS a document)*"

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "    It likes us well,"
      - "And at our more considered time we’ll read,"
      - "Answer, and think upon this business."
      - "Meantime we thank you for your well-took labor."
      - "Go to your rest. At night we’ll feast together."
      - "Most welcome home!"
    m:
      - "I like this news, and when I have time I’ll read this and think about how to reply. Meanwhile, thank you for your efforts. Go relax now. Tonight we’ll have dinner. Welcome back!"

  - os: "Exeunt VOLTEMAND and CORNELIUS"
    ms: "VOLTEMAND and CORNELIUS exit."

  - sp: POLONIUS
    o:
      - "This business is well ended."
      - "My liege and madam, to expostulate"
      - "What majesty should be, what duty is,"
      - "Why day is day, night night, and time is time,"
      - "Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time."
      - "Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit"
      - "And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,"
      - "I will be brief: your noble son is mad."
      - "Mad call I it, for, to define true madness,"
      - "What is ’t but to be nothing else but mad?"
      - "But let that go."
    m:
      - "Well, that turned out well in the end. Sir and madam, to make grand speeches about what majesty is, what service is, or why day is day, night is night, and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day, night, and time. Therefore, since the essence of wisdom is not talking too much, I’ll get right to the point here. Your son is crazy. “Crazy” I’m calling it, since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it’s craziness? But that’s another story."

  - sp: GERTRUDE
    o:
      - "More matter, with less art."
    m:
      - "Please, stick to the point."

  - sp: POLONIUS
    o:
      - "Madam, I swear I use no art at all."
      - "That he is mad, ’tis true. Tis true, ’tis pity,"
      - "And pity ’tis ’tis true—a foolish figure,"
      - "But farewell it, for I will use no art."
      - "Mad let us grant him then. And now remains"
      - "That we find out the cause of this effect,"
      - "Or rather say, the cause of this defect,"
      - "For this effect defective comes by cause."
      - "Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend."
      - "I have a daughter—have while she is mine—"
      - "Who in her duty and obedience, mark,"
      - "Hath given me this. Now gather and surmise."
      - "*(reads a letter) “To the celestial and my soul’s idol, the most beautified Ophelia”*—That’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase. “Beautified” is a vile phrase. But you shall hear. Thus: *(reads the letter) “In her excellent white bosom, these,” etc.*—"
    m:
      - "Madam, I’m doing nothing but sticking to the point. It’s true he’s crazy, and it’s a shame it’s true, and it’s truly a shame he’s crazy—but now I sound foolish, so I’ll get right to the point. Now, if we agree Hamlet’s crazy, then the next step is to figure out the cause of this effect of craziness, or I suppose I should say the cause of this defect, since this defective effect is caused by something. This is what we must do, and that’s exactly what needs to be done. Think about it. I have a daughter (I have her until she gets married) who’s given me this letter, considering it her duty. Listen and think about this: *(he reads a letter)* “To the heavenly idol of my soul, the most beautified Ophelia”—By the way, “beautified” sounds bad, it sounds awful, it sounds crude, it’s a terrible use of the word. But I’ll go on: *(he reads the letter)* “In her excellent white bosom,” et cetera, et cetera—you don’t need to hear all this stuff—"

  - sp: GERTRUDE
    o:
      - "Came this from Hamlet to her?"
    m:
      - "Hamlet wrote this letter to Ophelia?"

  - sp: POLONIUS
    o:
      - "Good madam, stay a while. I will be faithful."
      - "*(reads the letter)*"
      - "  “*Doubt thou the stars are fire*,"
      - "  *Doubt that the sun doth move*,"
      - "  *Doubt truth to be a liar*,"
      - "  *But never doubt I love*."
      - "  O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not art to reckon my groans, but that I love thee best, oh, most best, believe it. Adieu."
      - "  *Thine evermore, most dear lady*,"
      - "  *whilst this machine is to him*,"
      - "    Hamlet.”"
      - "This in obedience hath my daughter shown me,"
      - "And more above, hath his solicitings,"
      - "As they fell out by time, by means, and place,"
      - "All given to mine ear."
    m:
      - "Madam, please be patient. I’ll read it to you."
      - "*(he reads the letter)*"
      - " “*You may wonder if the stars are fire*,"
      - "  *You may wonder if the sun moves across the sky*."
      - "  *You may wonder if the truth is a liar*,"
      - "  *But never wonder if I love*."
      - "Oh, Ophelia, I’m bad at poetry. I can’t put my feelings into verse, but please believe I love you best, oh, best of all. Believe it."
      - "  *Yours forever, my dearest one,*"
      - "  *as long as I live—still chugging along*,"
      - "    Hamlet.”"
      - "Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter, and more like it. She’s told me all about how Hamlet has been courting her—all the details of where, and what he said, and when."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "But how hath she received his love?"
    m:
      - "And how did she react to all this?"

  - sp: POLONIUS
    o:
      - "What do you think of me?"
    m:
      - "Sir, what is your opinion of me?"

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "As of a man faithful and honorable."
    m:
      - "I know you are loyal and honorable."

  - sp: POLONIUS
    o:
      - "I would fain prove so. But what might you think,"
      - "When I had seen this hot love on the wing—"
      - "As I perceived it, I must tell you that,"
      - "Before my daughter told me—what might you,"
      - "Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,"
      - "If I had played the desk or table-book,"
      - "Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,"
      - "Or looked upon this love with idle sight?"
      - "What might you think? No, I went round to work,"
      - "And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:"
      - "“Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star."
      - "This must not be.” And then I prescripts gave her,"
      - "That she should lock herself from his resort,"
      - "Admit no messengers, receive no tokens."
      - "Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;"
      - "And he, repelled—a short tale to make—"
      - "Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,"
      - "Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,"
      - "Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,"
      - "Into the madness wherein now he raves"
      - "And all we mourn for."
    m:
      - "I would like to prove to you that I am. But what would you have thought of me if I had kept quiet when I found out about this hot little love (which I noticed even before my daughter told me about it)? My dear queen, what would you have thought of me if I had turned a blind eye to what was happening between Hamlet and my daughter? No, I had to do something. And so I said to my daughter: “Lord Hamlet is a prince, he’s out of your league. You have to end this.” And then I gave her orders to stay away from him, and not to accept any messages or little gifts from him. She did what I said. When she rejected Hamlet, he became sad, and stopped eating, stopped sleeping, got weak, got dizzy, and as a result lost his mind. And that’s why he’s crazy now, and all of us feel sorry for him."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "*(to GERTRUDE)* Do you think ’tis this?"
    m:
      - "*(to GERTRUDE)* Do you think that’s why Hamlet’s crazy?"

  - sp: POLONIUS
    o:
      - "Hath there been such a time—I would fain know that—"
      - "That I have positively said, “’Tis so,”"
      - "When it proved otherwise?"
    m:
      - "Has there ever been a time—I’d really like to know—when I’ve definitely said something was true, and it turned out not to be true?"

      - "And be not from his reason fall’n thereon,"
      - "Let me be no assistant for a state"
      - "But keep a farm and carters."
    m:
      - "When he’s there next time, I’ll send my daughter to see him. *(to CLAUDIUS)* You and I will hide behind the arras and watch what happens. If it turns out that Hamlet’s not in love after all, and hasn’t gone mad from love, then you can fire me from my court job and I’ll go work on a farm."

      - "Honest, my lord?"
    m:
      - "Good, sir?"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand."
    m:
      - "Yes, sir. Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world."

  - sp: POLONIUS
    o:

    o:
      - "Let her not walk i’ th’ sun. Conception is a blessing, but, as your daughter may conceive—Friend, look to ’t."
    m:
      - "Then by all means never let her walk in public. Procreation is a good thing, but if your daughter gets pregnant … look out, friend."

  - sp: POLONIUS
    o:
      - "*(aside)* How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far gone, far gone. And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love, very near this. I’ll speak to him again.—*(to HAMLET)* What do you read, my lord?"
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* Now, what does he mean by that? Still harping on my daughter. But he didn’t recognize me at first. He mistook me for a fish seller. He’s far gone. But when I was young I went crazy for love too, almost as bad as this. I’ll talk to him again.—*(to HAMLET)* What are you reading, your highness?"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Words, words, words."
    m:
      - "A lot of words."

  - sp: POLONIUS
    o:

    m:
      - "And what is the subject?"

What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty! In form and moving how express and admirable! In action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a god!

This beautiful canopy we call the sky—this majestic roof decorated with golden sunlight—why, it’s nothing more to me than disease-filled air. What a perfect invention a human is, how noble in his capacity to reason, how unlimited in thinking, how admirable in his shape and movement, how angelic in action, how godlike in understanding!

But it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido and thereabout of it, especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter.

I remember one critic said there was no vulgar language to spice up the dialogue, and showing off on playwright’s part. That critic called it an excellent play, containing things to reflect upon as well as sweet music to enjoy. I loved one speech in particular. It was when Aeneas told Dido about Priam’s murder.

What is Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, that he would weep for her? Just imagine what he would do if he had the cause for feeling that I do. He would drown the stage with his tears and burst the audience’s ears with his terrible words, drive the guilty spectators crazy, terrify the innocent ones, confuse the ignorant ones, and astound absolutely everyone’s eyes and ears. But what do I, a grim and uncourageous rascal, do? Mope around like a dreamer, not even bothering with plans for revenge, and I can say nothing—nothing at all—on behalf of a king whose dear life was stolen. Am I a coward? Is there anyone out there who’ll call me “villain” and slap me hard? Pull off my beard? Pinch my nose? Call me the worst liar? By God, if someone would do that to me, I’d take it, because I’m a lily-livered man—otherwise, I would’ve fattened up the local vultures with the intestines of that low-life king a long time ago. Bloody, inhuman villain! Remorseless, treacherous, sex-obsessed, unnatural villain! Ah, revenge! What an ass I am. I’m so damn brave. My dear father’s been murdered, and I’ve been urged to seek revenge by heaven and hell, and yet all I can do is stand around cursing like a whore in the streets. Damn it! I need to get myself together here! Hmm…. I’ve heard that guilty people watching a play have been so affected by the artistry of the scene that they are driven to confess their crimes out loud. Murder has no tongue, but miraculously it still finds a way to speak. I’ll have these actors perform something like my father’s murder in front of my uncle. I’ll watch my uncle. I’ll probe his conscience and see if he flinches. If he becomes pale, I know what to do. The ghost I saw may be the devil, and the devil has the power to assume a pleasing disguise, and so he may be taking advantage of my weakness and sadness to bring about my damnation. I need better evidence than the ghost to work with. The play’s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king."
