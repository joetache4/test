<p>I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house</p>
<p>of profession: one would think it were Mistress</p>
<p>Overdone’s own house, for here be many of her old</p>
<p>customers. First, here’s young Master Rash; he’s in</p>
<p>for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,</p>
<p>ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made</p>
<p>five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not</p>
<p>much in request, for the old women were all dead.</p>
<p>Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of</p>
<p>Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of</p>
<p>peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a</p>
<p>beggar. Then have we here young Dizzy, and young</p>
<p>Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master</p>
<p>Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young</p>
<p>Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master</p>
<p>Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the</p>
<p>great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed</p>
<p>Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in</p>
<p>our trade, and are now “for the Lord’s sake.”</p>

<p>I’ve got as many friends here as I did back at the brothel. You’d think it were Mistress Overdone’s very own house, so many of her old customers are here. First, here’s young Mister Hasty; he’s in for debt, having paid 197 pounds for some coarse brown paper and old ginger candy, and making back only three pounds selling it. Ginger wasn’t much in demand, because the old ladies were all dead. Then there’s one Mister Pirouette, defendant in a suit about four suits, brought by Mister Thick Velvet, the textile merchant. He’s being impeached over peach-colored satin. Then we’ve also got young Ditsy, and young Mister Cross-My-Heart, and Mister Cubic Zirconia and Mister Cheapskate, armed to fight duels, and young Kill-Heir who murdered robust Stuffed-Guts, and Mister Forward-Thrust the fighter, and dressed-to-kill Mister Shoe-Buckle, the world-traveler, and wild Half-Pint who stabbed Pots, and, I think, forty more gents—all great clients of our business, who now sing that old prison refrain, “Give us food for the Lord’s sake.”</p>

<p>O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see</p>
<p>thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain</p>
<p>to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for</p>
<p>my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set</p>
<p>me to ’t. But they say the duke will be here</p>
<p>to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:</p>
<p>if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been</p>
<p>at home, he had lived.</p>

<p>Oh, pretty Isabella, I’m sick at heart to see your eyes so red, but try to calm down. I have to dine on plain bread and water—to control my desire, I don’t fill my belly, since one big meal would get me excited. But they say the duke will be here tomorrow. I swear, Isabel, I loved your brother. If the good old whimsical duke, who loved to fool around in dark places, had been at home, Claudio would’ve lived.</p>
