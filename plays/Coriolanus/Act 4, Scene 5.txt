      - "Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may"
      - "My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,"
      - "The extreme dangers and the drops of blood"
      - "Shed for my thankless country are requited"
      - "But with that surname; a good memory,"
      - "And witness of the malice and displeasure"
      - "Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;"
      - "The cruelty and envy of the people,"
      - "Permitted by our dastard nobles, who"
      - "Have all forsook me, hath devour’d the rest;"
      - "And suffer’d me by the voice of slaves to be"
      - "Whoop’d out of Rome. Now this extremity"
      - "Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope-—"
      - "Mistake me not—to save my life, for if"
      - "I had fear’d death, of all the men i’ the world"
      - "I would have ’voided thee, but in mere spite,"
      - "To be full quit of those my banishers,"

      - "A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge"
      - "Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims"
      - "Of shame seen through thy country, speed"
      - "thee straight,"
      - "And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it"
      - "That my revengeful services may prove"
      - "As benefits to thee, for I will fight"
      - "Against my canker’d country with the spleen"
      - "Of all the under fiends. But if so be"

      - "Thou’rt tired, then, in a word, I also am"
      - "Longer to live most weary, and present"
      - "My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;"
      - "Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,"
      - "Since I have ever follow’d thee with hate,"
      - "Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country’s breast,"
      - "And cannot live but to thy shame, unless"
      - "It be to do thee service."
    m:
      - "My name is Caius Martius. I’ve done great hurt and mischief to you particularly and to all the Volsces, proof of which is my surname: Coriolanus. I worked very hard, faced extreme dangers, and shed drops of blood for my ungrateful country. My only compensation is that name. It’s a reminder and signifier of the hatred you should feel for me. That name is all that is left. With envious cruelty, the Roman people, enabled by the cowardly nobles, have turned on me and taken away all that I had. These slaves have voted me out of Rome.  These extreme circumstances are what have brought me to your home. Make no mistake: I have no wish to save my life. If I feared death, I would have avoided you more than any other man in the world. Instead I stand here before you with only my hatred and desire for revenge against my banishers. If you’re inclined to seek vengeance of your own and end the shame that’s seen throughout your country, see now how you can use my suffering to serve your purpose. Helping me get revenge will be beneficial to you. I’ll fight my own cursed country with the fury of all the hell beings. But if you choose not to do this, if you’re too tired to take this chance, then since I am also too tired to keep living, I present my throat to you and your longstanding hatred. You’d be a fool not to cut it.  I’ve always pursued you with hatred, I’ve spilled barrels of your country’s blood, so to let me live would only bring you shame unless I can work on your behalf."

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "O Martius, Martius!"
      - "Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart"
      - "A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter"
      - "Should from yond cloud speak divine things,"
      - "And say “’Tis true,” I’ld not believe them more"
      - "Than thee, all noble Martius. Let me twine"
      - "Mine arms about that body, where against"
      - "My grained ash an hundred times hath broke"
      - "And scarr’d the moon with splinters: here I clip"
      - "The anvil of my sword, and do contest"
      - "As hotly and as nobly with thy love"
      - "As ever in ambitious strength I did"
      - "Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,"
      - "I loved the maid I married; never man"
      - "Sigh’d truer breath; but that I see thee here,"
      - "Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart"
      - "Than when I first my wedded mistress saw"
      - "Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,"
      - "We have a power on foot; and I had purpose"
      - "Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,"
      - "Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out"
      - "Twelve several times, and I have nightly since"
      - "Dreamt of encounters ’twixt thyself and me;"
      - "We have been down together in my sleep,"
      - "Unbuckling helms, fisting each other’s throat,"
      - "And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Martius,"
      - "Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that"
      - "Thou art thence banish’d, we would muster all"
      - "From twelve to seventy, and pouring war"
      - "Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,"
      - "Like a bold flood o’er-bear. O, come, go in,"
      - "And take our friendly senators by the hands;"
      - "Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,"
      - "Who am prepared against your territories,"
      - "Though not for Rome itself."
    m:
      - "Oh, Martius, Martius! Each word that you’ve spoken has weeded from my heart a root of longstanding hatred. If from that far cloud Jupiter should speak divine things and say, “It’s true,” I would believe him no less than I believe you, noble Martius. Let me wrap my arms around this body of yours, which my wooden lance has beaten and been splintered against a hundred times. You are the anvil that my sword used to strike, and now I embrace you. Now I strive to gain your comradeship with as much ferocity and honor as I used to fight you. You should know: I loved the woman I married, that’s the truth, but seeing you here, you noble thing, makes my heart  more enraptured than when I first saw my new bride walk across my threshold. You are the god of war! I tell you, our army is ready to deploy, and now I have reason again to force your shield off of your strong arm, or lose my own arm instead. You’ve defeated me twelve different times, and every night since I have dreamed of encounters between us. We’d fight down on the ground, taking off our helmets, forcing our fists into each other’s throats. Then I wake up, half dead, and it was all a dream. Worthy Martius, even if we had no reason to attack Rome other than the fact that you’ve been banished, we would assemble every man from ages twelve to seventy and flood ungrateful Rome with our fury. Come inside now and shake hands with our senators. They are just now saying goodbye to me, as I was about to attack Roman territories, though not Rome itself."

    o:
      - "Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have"
      - "The leading of thine own revenges, take"
      - "The one half of my commission; and set down—"
      - "As best thou art experienced, since thou know’st"
      - "Thy country’s strength and weakness,—thine own ways;"
      - "Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,"
      - "Or rudely visit them in parts remote,"
      - "To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:"
      - "Let me commend thee first to those that shall"
      - "Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!"
      - "And more a friend than e’er an enemy;"
      - "Yet, Martius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!"
    m:
      - "Incomparable sir, if you’d like to take the lead with your own revenge, take over half of my command. Because you have the most experience and you know Rome’s strengths and weaknesses, decide for yourself whether to attack the city directly at the gates or to sneak up on them in the faraway territories and frighten them before destroying them. Either way, come in. Let me introduce you to those who will approve of your desires. A thousand welcomes! You’re more of a friend now than you were ever an enemy—and you were a great enemy. Give me your hand—you are most welcome!"

    o:
      - "An he had been cannibally given, he might have"
      - "broiled and eaten him too."
    m:

    o:
      - "But, more of thy news?"
    m:
      - "But what other news do you have?"

  - sp: THIRD SERVINGMAN
    o:
      - "Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son"
      - "and heir to Mars; set at upper end o’ the table; no"
      - "question asked him by any of the senators, but they"
      - "stand bald before him: our general himself makes a"
      - "mistress of him: sanctifies himself with’s hand and"
      - "turns up the white o’ the eye to his discourse. But"
      - "the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i’"
      - "the middle and but one half of what he was"
      - "yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty"
      - "and grant of the whole table. He’ll go, he says,"
      - "and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he"
      - "will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled."
    m:
      - "The guests here can’t stop talking about him. It’s as if he were the son and heir to Mars. He’s sitting at the head of the table and none of the senators are asking him any questions—they’ve all taken their hats off to him. Our general himself treats him like a mistress, touching his hand like a sacred relic, listening with wide-eyed wonder to his every word. But the bottom line is that our general is now half the man he was yesterday. He’s given half his power away to Caius Martius and the whole table supports him. He says that he’ll go and catch the keeper of Rome’s gates by the ears, that he’ll mow down whoever stands in his way, leaving a trail behind him."

    o:
      - "And he’s as like to do’t as any man I can imagine."
    m:
      - "And he’s as likely to do it as any man I can imagine."

  - sp: THIRD SERVINGMAN
    o:
      - "Do’t! he will do’t; for, look you, sir, he has as"
      - "many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it"
      - "were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as"
      - "we term it, his friends whilst he’s in directitude."
    m:
      - "Do it! He’ll do it. Look, sir, he has as many friends as enemies—and his friends can’t actually be friends to him while he’s in dejectitude."

  - sp: FIRST SERVINGMAN
    o:
      - "Directitude! what’s that?"
    m:
      - "Dejectitude! What’s that?"

    o:
      - "But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,"
      - "and the man in blood, they will out of their"
      - "burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with"
      - "him."
    m:
      - "But when they see that his spirits have lifted and that he’s a man in full vitality again, they’ll come out of hiding, like rabbits after a rain, and celebrate with him."

    o:
      - "But when goes this forward?"
    m:
      - "When will this happen?"

    o:
      - "To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the"

      - "parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they"
      - "wipe their lips."
    m:
      - "Tomorrow, today, soon. You’ll hear the battle drum by this afternoon. It’s like part of their feast and will be underway before they’ve wiped their lips."

  - sp: SECOND SERVINGMAN
    o:
      - "Why, then we shall have a stirring world again."
      - "This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase"

    m:
      - "Then things will come back to life again here. This peace does nothing but rust iron and make people become tailors and singers."

  - sp: FIRST SERVINGMAN
    o:
      - "Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as"
      - "day does night; it’s spritely, waking, audible, and"
      - "full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;"
      - "mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more"
      - "bastard children than war’s a destroyer of men."
    m:
      - "I say: give me war. It’s better than peace the way night is better than day. It’s spritely, waking, loud, and spirited. Peace is the definition of stagnation, of lethargy. It’s dull, deaf, sleepy, and unfeeling. It creates more bastard children than wars destroy men."

  - sp: SECOND SERVINGMAN
    o:
      - "’Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to"
      - "be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a"
      - "great maker of cuckolds."
    m:
      - "It’s true. And while war can be said to be seductive in a sense, it cannot be denied that in times of peace, wives cheat on their husbands."

  - sp: FIRST SERVINGMAN
    o:
      - "Ay, and it makes men hate one another."
    m:
      - "Yes, and it makes men hate one another."

      - "The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap"
      - "as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising."
    m:
      - "Because they need one another less. I’d give my money to have war! I hope the Romans are as cheap as the Volsces. *(A noise comes from offstage)* They’re getting up from the table."
