<b>LADY PERCY</b>
<p>O yet, for God’s sake, go not to these wars.</p>
<p>The time was, father, that you broke your word,</p>
<p>When you were more endeared to it than now,</p>
<p>When your own Percy, when my heart’s dear Harry,</p>
<p>Threw many a northward look to see his father</p>
<p>Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.</p>
<p>Who then persuaded you to stay at home?</p>
<p>There were two honors lost, yours and your son’s.</p>
<p>For yours, the God of heaven brighten it.</p>
<p>For his, it stuck upon him as the sun</p>
<p>In the gray vault of heaven, and by his light</p>
<p>Did all the chivalry of England move</p>
<p>To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass</p>
<p>Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves.</p>
<p>He had no legs that practiced not his gait;</p>
<p>And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,</p>
<p>Became the accents of the valiant;</p>
<p>For those that could speak low and tardily</p>
<p>Would turn their own perfection to abuse</p>
<p>To seem like him. So that in speech, in gait,</p>
<p>In diet, in affections of delight,</p>
<p>In military rules, humors of blood,</p>
<p>He was the mark and glass, copy and book,</p>
<p>That fashioned others. And him—O wondrous him!</p>
<p>O miracle of men!—him did you leave,</p>
<p>Second to none, unseconded by you,</p>
<p>To look upon the hideous god of war</p>
<p>In disadvantage, to abide a field</p>
<p>Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur’s name</p>
<p>Did seem defensible. So you left him.</p>
<p>Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong</p>
<p>To hold your honor more precise and nice</p>
<p>With others than with him. Let them alone.</p>
<p>The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong.</p>
<p>Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,</p>
<p>Today might I, hanging on Hotspur’s neck,</p>
<p>Have talked of Monmouth’s grave.</p>

<b>LADY PERCY</b>
<p>For God’s sake, don’t go to these wars! Father-in-law, you once broke your word when you had better reason to keep it than you do now. Your own son Percy—my heart’s beloved Harry—looked northward again and again, hoping to see his father coming with an army. But he hoped in vain. Who persuaded you to stay home that time? Two honors were lost in that battle: yours, and your son’s. As for yours, I hope God will make it shine again. As for Harry’s honor, it clung to him like the sun in a pale blue sky, and by its light every knight in England was moved to act bravely. He was the mirror in which noble youths dressed themselves. All men copied his way of walking, except those who had no legs. And talking loudly and quickly—the one flaw nature had given him—became the speech pattern for all brave men. Those who spoke softly and slowly would corrupt their proper speech, just to seem more like Harry. In speech, bearing, and diet; in inclinations toward pleasure, in military actions, and in moods, he was the target, mirror, example, and rulebook that other men followed. And him—Oh wondrous him! Oh miracle of men!—you left him! The best man in the world, unsupported by you, faced the hideous god of war from a position of weakness. His only defense was the sound of his own name, and that is how you left him. Never insult his memory by letting your honor count more with strangers than with him. Leave them alone: Marshal Mowbray and the Archbishop are strong. If my darling Harry had had half their army, I might be hanging on his neck today, talking about Prince Hal’s grave.</p>

<p>Beshrew your heart,</p>
<p>Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me</p>

<p>If they get ground and vantage of the King,</p>

<p>To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,</p>
<p>First let them try themselves. So did your son;</p>
<p>He was so suffered. So came I a widow,</p>
<p>And never shall have length of life enough</p>
<p>To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes</p>
<p>That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven</p>
<p>For recordation to my noble husband.</p>

<b>LADY PERCY</b>
<p>If they make any headway against the King, then join them, and like a steel rod make their strength even stronger. But in the name of the love you feel for us, let them begin on their own. That’s how your son fought. You allowed him to do that, and that’s how I became a widow. If I spend the rest of my life pouring tears on the plant of remembrance, it will never grow tall enough to pay proper tribute to my extraordinary husband.</p>
