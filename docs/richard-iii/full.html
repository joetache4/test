<b>RICHARD</b>
<p>Now is the winter of our discontent</p>
<p>Made glorious summer by this son of York,</p>
<p>And all the clouds that loured upon our house</p>
<p>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</p>
<p>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,</p>
<p>Our bruisèd arms hung up for monuments,</p>
<p>Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,</p>
<p>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</p>
<p>Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;</p>
<p>And now, instead of mounting barbèd steeds</p>
<p>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</p>
<p>He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber</p>
<p>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</p>
<p>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,</p>
<p>Nor made to court an amorous looking glass;</p>
<p>I, that am rudely stamped and want love’s majesty</p>
<p>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</p>
<p>I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,</p>
<p>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</p>
<p>Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time</p>
<p>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</p>
<p>And that so lamely and unfashionable</p>
<p>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them—</p>
<p>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</p>
<p>Have no delight to pass away the time,</p>
<p>Unless to see my shadow in the sun</p>
<p>And descant on mine own deformity.</p>
<p>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover</p>
<p>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</p>
<p>I am determinèd to prove a villain</p>
<p>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</p>
<p>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</p>
<p>By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,</p>
<p>To set my brother Clarence and the king</p>
<p>In deadly hate, the one against the other;</p>
<p>And if King Edward be as true and just</p>
<p>As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,</p>
<p>This day should Clarence closely be mewed up</p>
<p>About a prophecy which says that “G”</p>
<p>Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.</p>
<p>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.</p>

<b>RICHARD</b>
<p>Now all of my family’s troubles have come to a glorious end, thanks to my brother, King Edward IV. All the clouds that threatened the York family have vanished and turned to sunshine. Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads. We’ve taken off our armor and weapons and hung them up as decorations. Instead of hearing trumpets call us to battle, we dance at parties. We get to wear easy smiles on our faces rather than the grim expressions of war. Instead of charging toward our enemies on armored horses, we dance for our ladies in their chambers, accompanied by sexy songs on the lute. But I’m not made to be a seducer, or to make faces at myself in the mirror. I was badly made and don’t have the looks to strut my stuff in front of pretty sluts. I’ve been cheated of a nice body and face, or even normal proportions. I am deformed, spit out from my mother’s womb prematurely and so badly formed that dogs bark at me as I limp by them. I’m left with nothing to do in this weak, idle peacetime, unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about <em>that</em>. Since I can’t amuse myself by being a lover, I’ve decided to become a villain. I’ve set dangerous plans in motion, using lies, drunken prophecies, and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other. If King Edward is as honest and fair-minded as I am deceitful and cruel, then Clarence is going to be locked away in prison today because of a prophecy that “G” will murder Edward’s children. Oh, time to hide what I’m thinking—here comes Clarence.</p>

<b>CLARENCE</b>
<p>I’ll tell you as soon as I know, Richard, because at this point I have no idea. All I’ve been able to find out is that our brother the king has been listening to prophecies and dreams. He picked out the letter “G” from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that “G” will take the throne away from his children. He thinks “G” is me. I’ve learned that this, along with other frivolous reasons like it, is what prompted the king to send me to prison.</p>

Then God’s free to send King Edward to heaven, too, and leave me the world to run around in! I’ll marry the earl of Warwick’s youngest daughter, Lady Anne. So what if I killed her husband and her father? The best way to make up for the girl’s losses is to become what she’s lost: a husband and a father.

<p>Has anyone ever courted a woman in this state of mind? And has anyone ever won her, as I’ve done? I’ll get her, but I won’t keep her long. What! I, who killed her husband and his father, managed to win her over when her hatred for me was strongest, while she’s swearing her head off, sobbing her eyes out, and the bloody corpse, proof of why she should hate me, right in front of her? She has God, her conscience, and my own acts against me, and I have nothing on my side but the ugly devil and my false looks. And yet, against all odds, I win her over! Ha! Has she already forgotten her brave husband, Prince Edward, whom I stabbed on the battlefield three months ago in my anger? The world will never again produce such a sweet, lovely gentleman. He was graced with lots of natural gifts, he was young, valiant, wise, and no doubt meant to be king. And yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me, who cut her sweet prince’s life short and made her a widow? On me, though I am barely half the man that Edward was? On me, though I am limping and deformed? I bet I’ve been wrong about myself all this time. Even though I don’t see it, this lady thinks I’m a marvelously good-looking man. Time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions. Since I’m suddenly all the rage, it will be worth the cost. But first, I’ll dump this fellow in his grave, then return to my love weeping with grief. Come out, beautiful sun—until I’ve bought a mirror to admire my reflection in, I’ll watch my shadow as I stroll along.</p>

Looking toward England, we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we’d had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters. As we were pacing the deck, which was tipping heavily, Richard seemed to stumble, and as I tried to grab hold of him and keep him from falling, he knocked me overboard into the crashing waves. Lord, how painful it was to drown. The sound of the rushing water was terrible, and so were the sights. I saw a thousand shipwrecks, a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone, huge anchors, chunks of gold, heaps of pearls, and precious jewels—all scattered on the bottom of the sea.</p>

It fills a man full of obstacles. It made me once restore a purse of gold that by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it.

<p>I won’t bother with it. Conscience makes a man a coward. If he steals, it accuses him. If he wants to swear, it restrains him. If he sleeps with his neighbor’s wife, it exposes him. It blushes, is easily embarrassed, and stages regular uprisings in a man’s heart. It’s just too much trouble. It once made me return a purse full of money that I found—it turns anyone who treats it decently into a beggar. It has been thrown out of all sorts of towns and cities it visits, and anyone who wants to live well should learn to trust only himself and live without it.</p>

Tell the citizens how Edward put to death a citizen just because the citizen said he was going to make his own son “heir to the crown”—when all the citizen meant was that he owned a tavern called “the Crown” and was going to leave it to his son. And then point out what a lech Edward was and what a bestial appetite he had for women, which touched even the citizens’ own servants, daughters, and wives. There was no limit to what his lustful eye and savage heart would prey on. And, if you need to, approach the subject of me: tell them that when my mother became pregnant with the insatiable Edward, my noble father was fighting in France. With a little calculating, it’s obvious that Edward is not in fact my father’s child—not a surprising revelation if you consider how my father the noble duke looked nothing like this man. But only hint at this vaguely, because, as you know, my mother’s still alive.</p>

<p>I did. I talked about how he was engaged to Lady Lucy, and how he was engaged to Lady Bona through the help of the earl of Warwick. I spoke of the unquenchable greediness of Edward’s desires and the way he forced himself on the wives of Londoners. I mentioned the way he punished people harshly for minor offenses. I said he was not the son of the noble duke of York, because your father was in France when he was conceived, which explains why he doesn’t have anything in common with his father. And then I suggested that you were the spitting image of your father, both in the way you look and in the nobleness of your character. I went into all your victories in Scotland, your skill as a warrior, your wisdom in peacetime, your generosity, your goodness, and your exceptional modesty. Indeed, I left nothing out. And when my oration came to a close, I asked those who loved their country to cry, “God save Richard, England’s royal king!”</p>

<p>No, God help me, they didn’t say a word. Like silent statues or stones that breathed, they just gazed at each other and turned as pale as the dead. When I saw this, I scolded them and asked the mayor what this stubborn silence meant. He said that the people weren’t used to being spoken to except by the Recorder. So I urged the Recorder to repeat my tale—you know, “The duke of Buckingham said this, Buckingham meant that,” but nothing on his own authority. When he was done, a few followers of my own at the far end of the hall hurled their caps in the air. Some ten voices cried, “God save King Richard!” I jumped on this slender opportunity and said, “Thank you, noble citizens and friends. This widespread applause and enthusiastic shouts make clear you stand behind Richard.” And then I broke off and quickly came away.</p>

<p>Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</p>

But if I do speak and refuse your request, then I’m guilty of reprimanding my friends, who have been faithful and loving toward me. So, I’ll speak to make clear I don’t want the crown but also that I am grateful to you. Here is my definitive answer: thank you for your love, but I’m going to have to turn down your weighty request because I don’t deserve to be king. First of all, even if all the obstacles were eliminated and my path led straight to the crown—if it were truly my birthright—I would rather hide from my greatness than hide inside the greatness of the position itself and be smothered by it. My spirit is poor, and I have so many terrible defects that as king I would be like a little boat tossed about on a mighty sea. So, thank God, there is no real need for me, as I wouldn’t be able to help you much. The royal tree has left us other fruit, which, with time, will do just fine on the throne and make us all happy as king, I’m sure. Someone other than I has the right and the good fortune to be made king. God forbid that I snatch the crown from him.</p>

<p>My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace,</p>

<p>Even in the afternoon of her best days,</p>

<b>BUCKINGHAM</b>
<p>My lord, what you’ve said makes clear you have a conscience, but your objections are trivial, given the circumstances. You say that Prince Edward is your brother’s son. We agree, but not by your brother’s wife. King Edward was going to marry Lady Lucy—your mother can vouch for that—and then he was betrothed to Bona, the King of France’s sister-in-law. But both of these were put off by Elizabeth Grey, a careworn mother of many children who had once been a beauty but was now a stressed-out widow long past her prime. Nevertheless, under pretence of asking a favor of him, she attracted his lustful eye and seduced him so thoroughly that he completely debased himself, committing adultery with her. It resulted in this Edward, whom we’re polite enough to call “Prince.” Out of respect for the living, I’ll restrain myself from telling you everything. But, my good lord, if you don’t care about this country, at least use your own pure lineage to rescue us from the current corruption of the royal line.</p>

But listen, if <em>you</em> won’t become king, we’ll just get someone else, to the disgrace and ruin of your family. We will not have your brother’s son as king. On this note, we’re leaving. Come, citizens. Damn it, I’m not going to beg anymore!</p>

<p>No? Why?

I’m telling you, when I looked at Richard’s face, this is what I wished: “I want you to be cursed for making me a widow so young. And when you get married, let sorrow haunt your bed. And I hope your wife—if any woman is crazy enough to marry you—is more miserable about the fact that you’re alive as you have made me by killing my husband!” And then what? Before I even had time to repeat the curse, my woman’s heart was taken captive by his sweet, slick words. I became the victim of my own curse. Since I married him, I have not had one hour’s sleep in his bed. Every night I’m awakened by his terrified dreams. It doesn’t matter if I sleep, though. He hates me because of who my father is. He will, no doubt, get rid of me soon.</p>

Dighton and Forrest, whom I hired to perform the butchery, are used to killing people, the bloody dogs. But they melted with tenderness and human compassion, weeping like children, when they described what they’d done. “The tender babes lay like this,” said Dighton. “Like this,” said Forrest, “with their innocent white arms around each other. Their lips, like four red roses on a stalk, touched. A prayer book lay on their pillow, which” said Forrest, “almost made me change my mind. But, oh, the devil”—there he stopped talking and Dighton took up where he left off: “We smothered the perfect, most sweet work of nature.” The two men were both destroyed by remorse. They couldn’t speak. So I left them to bring the news to the murderous king. And here he comes.</p>

<p>Ely joining Richmond troubles me more than Buckingham and his quickly assembled army. Come, I’ve heard that frightened analysis only serves to delay action, and delay can lead to ruin. So my method is going to be to move as quickly as fire. Come, let’s gather an army. The best strategy is to head right to the battlefield. When traitors challenge us to fight, it’s best to act fast.</p>

<b>QUEEN MARGARET</b>
<p>Back then, I called you “a poor, imitation queen,” a badly reproduced copy of what I was, a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow, a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell, a mother only teased with two beautiful children, who would soon die. I said you were a mere shadow of what a queen once was, a garish target to be aimed at again and again, an empty symbol of dignity without any substance, a mockery of a queen only there to fill in a role. And I was right, because where’s your husband now? Your brothers? Your two sons? Your source of joy? Who kneels at your feet now and says, “God save the Queen?” What noblemen are bowing and scraping to flatter you now? And where is your throng of followers? Once you’ve laid out all of these losses, it’s clear what’s left. In place of a happy wife, there’s a miserable widow. Instead of a joyful mother, here’s a woman who cries at the mention of her children. For one who bestows favors on others, here’s one who has to beg for favors. Instead of a queen, we have a poor woman with a crown of worries. She who mocked me now is mocked by me. She who once ordered everyone about is now obeyed by no one. Your fortune has fallen. Now you have only the memory of what you were, which tortures you when you consider what you’ve become. You once stole my position; now you get to have the grief that goes with it. Now like an ox, you carry half my heavy burden of grief—here, I’ll give you the rest. Farewell, York’s wife. Goodbye, queen of tragic misfortune. Your English sorrows will make me smile in France.</p>

<p>Whatever has already been done can’t be undone now. Men act imprudently sometimes, then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them. If I took the kingdom from your sons, I’ll give it to your daughter to make up for it. If I have killed your children, I will have children with your daughter. A grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is. Your grandchildren will be just one step removed from your own children—they share your character, your blood, and require the same effort minus that one night of labor, like that which you suffered through for your own daughter. Your children caused you trouble in your youth, but mine will bring you comfort in your old age. The only loss you’ve had is that your son was not king. Because of that loss, your daughter will be queen. I can’t make up for everything that I’d like to, so accept such kindness as I can offer. Your son Dorset, who fled in fear to join an army in France against me, could come home to high promotions and great dignity. The king who calls your beautiful daughter “wife” will call Dorset “brother.” And you will be the mother to a king again, with all the miseries of unhappy times not just repaired, but also improved. Indeed, we have many good days to look forward to! The tears you have shed will be transformed into pearls. Your happiness will be like a loan that has grown through interest to ten times its original size. Go, then, mother, to your daughter. Give her the benefit of your experience, and prepare her to hear me court her. Make her aspire to be queen. Tell the princess about the sweet, silent hours of joy there are in marriage. And when my army has chastised the petty rebel, that stupid Buckingham, I will return wreathed in victory crowns and lead your daughter to a conqueror’s bed. She will be the only victor over my triumphs. She will be the ruler of a Caesar.</p>

This is the day I’m going to get what I wished for when I wished that the person I most trusted would betray me. This, this All-Souls’ day, is my just desserts. I tried to play games with God, and he turned my fake prayer on my head, giving me for real what I’d asked for as a joke. This is how God forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves. Margaret’s curse has come true. “When Richard has split your heart in two with grief,” she said, “you’ll know that Margaret was a prophetess.” Come, sirs, bring me to this block of shame. I have done wrong, so I will suffer wrong. I have been blamed because I deserved to be.</p>

<p>Your mother sends her blessings. She prays continually on your behalf. Enough about that—morning will be here soon. To be brief—as the occasion requires—prepare to fight early in the morning, when your future will be decided. I can’t do everything I want to, but I’ll help you as well as I can. But I can’t be too obvious about being on your side without risking the life of your stepbrother, young George. If I’m seen helping you, George will be killed right in front of my eyes. Farewell. The lack of time and the risk I’m under will have to keep us from bonding and catching up on each other’s news the way we usually would after not seeing each other for so long.

<p>God and our good cause fight upon our side.</p>
<p>The prayers of holy saints and wrongèd souls,</p>
<p>Like high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces.</p>
<p>Richard except, those whom we fight against</p>
<p>Had rather have us win than him they follow.</p>
<p>For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,</p>
<p>A bloody tyrant and a homicide;</p>
<p>One raised in blood, and one in blood established;</p>
<p>One that made means to come by what he hath,</p>
<p>And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;</p>
<p>A base foul stone, made precious by the foil</p>
<p>Of England’s chair, where he is falsely set;</p>
<p>One that hath ever been God’s enemy.</p>
<p>Then if you fight against God’s enemy,</p>
<p>God will, in justice, ward you as his soldiers.</p>
<p>If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,</p>
<p>You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain.</p>
<p>If you do fight against your country’s foes,</p>
<p>Your country’s fat shall pay your pains the hire.</p>
<p>If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,</p>
<p>Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors.</p>
<p>If you do free your children from the sword,</p>
<p>Your children’s children quits it in your age.</p>
<p>Then, in the name of God and all these rights,</p>
<p>Advance your standards. Draw your willing swords.</p>
<p>For me, the ransom of my bold attempt</p>
<p>Shall be this cold corpse on the earth’s cold face;</p>
<p>But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt</p>
<p>The least of you shall share his part thereof.</p>
<p>Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;</p>
<p>God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!</p>

<b>RICHMOND</b>
<p>Why, then, it’s time to put on my armor and instruct the troops. <em>(to his soldiers)</em> I can’t tell you much right now, loyal countrymen, because we don’t have time. But know this: We have God and a good cause on our side. The prayers of saints and those that Richard wronged support us like high-walled fortresses. Other than Richard, even those whom we fight against would rather we won. Because who is this man they follow? Truly, gentlemen, a violent tyrant and a murderer, who rose to his high position by shedding blood and kept the position the same way. He rose to the top by means of others and then slaughtered them. He’s like a worthless stone, who only seems like a valuable gem because he’s on the throne, where he doesn’t belong. He has always been God’s enemy. And when you fight God’s enemy, God will protect you. If you struggle to bring down a tyrant, you will sleep peacefully when the tyrant is killed. When you fight against your country’s enemies, you will be paid for your efforts with your country’s wealth. If you fight to protect your wives, your wives will welcome you home as conquerors. When you free your children from the sword, your grandchildren will repay you in your old age. So, in the name of God and all the good that will come of this battle, march with your flags high and draw your swords. As for me, if I fail, the only ransom I will offer the enemy is my corpse. But if I succeed, every one of you will share in the profit. Play boldly and cheerfully, drummers and trumpeters. Here’s to God and Saint George! To Richmond and victory!</p>

Don’t let babbling dreams frighten us—conscience is just a word that cowards use to intimidate the strong. The strong fight we put on will be our conscience, our swords will be our law. March on, be brave in battle, and let’s go pell-mell to heaven, if not hand in hand to hell. <em>(to his army)</em> What more can I say? Remember who you’re dealing with—a random bunch of bums, rascals, runaways, Breton scum, and peasant hangers-on whom an overcrowded nation vomits out to populate every desperate, sure-to-fail enterprise. You have been sleeping soundly, and they bring unrest. You own land they want to steal. Those of you who are blessed with beautiful wives, they want to defile them. And who’s leading them but an inconsequential fellow who for the longest time lived in Brittany at his mother’s expense? A girly man, a man who never in his life felt more cold than seeps into one’s boots in the snow? Let’s send these stragglers back over the sea. Let’s whip these arrogant relics of France—these starving beggars, tired of their lives, who would have hanged themselves, poor rats, if it weren’t for this foolish enterprise they’ve been dreaming about—back to France. If we’re going to be conquered, let men conquer us, and not these French bastards whom our forefathers already beat, thrashed, and pummeled on their own turf, and shamed them forever in the history books. Should these people enjoy our lands? Sleep with our wives? Rape our daughters?</p>
