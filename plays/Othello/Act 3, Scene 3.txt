  - os: "Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA"
    ms: "DESDEMONA, CASSIO and EMILIA enter."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do"
      - "All my abilities in thy behalf."
    m:
      - "I’ll do everything I can for you, Cassio."

  - sp: EMILIA
    o:
      - "Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband"
      - "As if the cause were his."
    m:
      - "Please do, madam. My husband’s so upset about Cassio’s problem you’d think it was his own."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Oh, that’s an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,"
      - "But I will have my lord and you again"
      - "As friendly as you were."
    m:
      - "Your husband’s such a good man. Don’t worry, Cassio. I’m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "    Bounteous madam,"
      - "Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,"
      - "He’s never anything but your true servant."
    m:
      - "My dear beautiful lady, whatever happens to Michael Cassio, he’ll always be your humble servant."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "I know ’t, I thank you. You do love my lord."
      - "You have known him long, and be you well assured"
      - "He shall in strangeness stand no farther off"
      - "Than in a polite distance."
    m:
      - "I know that. Thank you. You’re my husband’s friend and you’ve known him a long time. I assure you the only reason he’s keeping away from you now is political."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "    Ay, but, lady,"
      - "That policy may either last so long,"
      - "Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,"
      - "Or breed itself so out of circumstances,"
      - "That, I being absent and my place supplied,"
      - "My general will forget my love and service."
    m:
      - "Yes, my lady. But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service, especially if I’m gone and someone else has my job."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here"
      - "I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,"
      - "If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it"
      - "To the last article. My lord shall never rest,"
      - "I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience."
      - "His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift,"
      - "I’ll intermingle everything he does"
      - "With Cassio’s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,"
      - "For thy solicitor shall rather die"
      - "Than give thy cause away."
    m:
      - "That’ll never happen. Emilia here will be my witness: I promise you that you’ll get your position back again. And if I promise to help someone, I do everything I can. My husband will never get a moment’s rest, I’ll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out of patience. He will think that his bed has become a conference table for discussing your problem—he won’t be able to get away from it. I’ll bring up your name at every moment. So cheer up. I’m your advocate, and I’d rather die than give up on you."

  - os: "Enter OTHELLO and IAGO"
    ms: "OTHELLO and IAGO enter."

  - sp: EMILIA
    o:
      - "    Madam, here comes my lord."
    m:
      - "Madam, here comes your husband."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Madam, I’ll take my leave."
    m:
      - "Madam, I’d better leave now."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "    Why, stay and hear me speak."
    m:
      - "Why not stay and hear me talk to him?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease,"
      - "Unfit for mine own purposes."
    m:
      - "No, madam. I’m very uncomfortable, and that won’t help my case."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Well, do your discretion."
    m:
      - "Well, do whatever you think best."

  - os: "Exit CASSIO"
    ms: "CASSIO exits."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Ha! I like not that."
    m:
      - "Hey! I don’t like that."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "What dost thou say?"
    m:
      - "What did you say?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Nothing, my lord, or if—I know not what."
    m:
      - "Nothing, my lord, or if I did—I don’t know what."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?"
    m:
      - "Wasn’t that Cassio leaving my wife?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it"
      - "That he would steal away so guilty-like"
      - "Seeing you coming."
    m:
      - "Cassio, my lord? No, I don’t think so. He wouldn’t sneak away looking so guilty when he saw you coming."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "I do believe ’twas he."
    m:
      - "I really think it was him."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "    How now, my lord?"
      - "I have been talking with a suitor here,"
      - "A man that languishes in your displeasure."
    m:
      - "What’s this, my lord? I was talking to a petitioner here just now, someone who’s suffering from your anger."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Who is ’t you mean?"
    m:
      - "Who do you mean?"

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,"
      - "If I have any grace or power to move you"
      - "His present reconciliation take."
      - "For if he be not one that truly loves you,"
      - "That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,"
      - "I have no judgment in an honest face."
      - "I prithee, call him back."
    m:
      - "Your lieutenant, Cassio. Oh, if I’ve got any influence over you at all, please patch things up with him. In my judgment, this man truly loves you, and his mistake was innocent rather than wicked. Please call him and tell him to come back here."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Went he hence now?"
    m:
      - "Was that him just now?"

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Ay, sooth, so humbled"
      - "That he hath left part of his grief with me"
      - "To suffer with him. Good love, call him back."
    m:
      - "Yes. He feels so bad and humble that I feel bad along with him. My love, call him back in here."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Not now, sweet Desdemona. Some other time."
    m:
      - "Not now, my sweet Desdemona. Some other time."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "But shall ’t be shortly?"
    m:
      - "But will it be soon?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    The sooner, sweet, for you."
    m:
      - "Very soon, because you want it."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Shall ’t be tonight at supper?"
    m:
      - "Will it be tonight at supper?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    No, not tonight."
    m:
      - "No, not tonight."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Tomorrow dinner, then?"
    m:
      - "Then tomorrow at dinner?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    I shall not dine at home,"
      - "I meet the captains at the citadel."
    m:
      - "I won’t be eating dinner at home. I’ll be meeting the captains at the citadel."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Why, then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn."
      - "On Tuesday noon, or night, or Wednesday morn."
      - "I prithee name the time, but let it not"
      - "Exceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent,"
      - "And yet his trespass, in our common reason"
      - "(Save that, they say, the wars must make example"
      - "Out of her best) is not, almost, a fault"
      - "T’ incur a private check. When shall he come?"
      - "Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul"
      - "What you would ask me that I should deny"
      - "Or stand so mamm’ring on. What? Michael Cassio"
      - "That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,"
      - "When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,"
      - "Hath ta’en your part, to have so much to do"
      - "To bring him in? Trust me, I could do much—"
    m:
      - "Well then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morning. Or Tuesday noon or at night, or Wednesday morning. Please just name a time, but don’t wait more than three days. He’s very sorry. His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place—though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers. So when should he come? Tell me, Othello. I can’t imagine you asking me for something and me telling you no or standing there muttering. Michael Cassio came with you when you were trying to win my love. Sometimes I’d criticize you to him, and he’d defend you. And now I have to make this big fuss about bringing him back? I swear, I could do so much—"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will,"
      - "I will deny thee nothing."
    m:
      - "Please, no more. He can come whenever he wants. I won’t refuse you anything."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "    Why, this is not a boon,"
      - "’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,"
      - "Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,"
      - "Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit"
      - "To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit"
      - "Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed"
      - "It shall be full of poise and difficult weight"
      - "And fearful to be granted."
    m:
      - "Don’t act like you’re doing me a favor! This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it’s cold outside, or eat nutritious food, or do something that’s good for you. If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test, it’ll be something difficult and terrible."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    I will deny thee nothing!"
      - "Whereon I do beseech thee, grant me this,"
      - "To leave me but a little to myself."
    m:
      - "I won’t deny you anything! But in return, please, do one thing for me: leave me alone for a little while."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord."
    m:
      - "Would I ever deny you anything? No. Goodbye, my husband."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Farewell, my Desdemona. I’ll come to thee straight."
    m:
      - "Goodbye, my Desdemona. I’ll come see you right away."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Emilia, come.—Be as your fancies teach you."
      - "Whate’er you be, I am obedient."
    m:
      - "Come here, Emilia.—Do whatever you feel like doing, my husband, and I’ll obey you."

  - os: "Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA"
    ms: "DESDEMONA and EMILIA exit."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul"
      - "But I do love thee! And when I love thee not"
      - "Chaos is come again."
    m:
      - "What a wonderful girl! God help me, I love you! And when I stop loving you, the universe will fall back into the chaos that was there when time began."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "My noble lord—"
    m:
      - "My noble lord—"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "What dost thou say, Iago?"
    m:
      - "What is it, Iago?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Did Michael Cassio, when you wooed my lady,"
      - "Know of your love?"
    m:
      - "When you were wooing Desdemona, did Michael Cassio know about it?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "He did, from first to last."
      - "Why dost thou ask?"
    m:
      - "Yes, he knew about it the whole time. Why do you ask?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "But for a satisfaction of my thought,"
      - "No further harm."
    m:
      - "I was just curious. No reason."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    Why of thy thought, Iago?"
    m:
      - "Why are you curious, Iago?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "I did not think he had been acquainted with her."
    m:
      - "I didn’t realize he knew her."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Oh, yes, and went between us very oft."
    m:
      - "Oh, yes. He carried messages back and forth between us very often."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Indeed?"
    m:
      - "Oh, really?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Indeed? Ay, indeed! Discern’st thou aught in that?"
      - "Is he not honest?"
    m:
      - "Oh, really? Yes, really. Do you see something wrong with that? Isn’t he an honest man?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Honest, my lord?"
    m:
      - "Honest, my lord?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Honest, ay, honest."
    m:
      - "Honest, yes, honest."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "My lord, for aught I know."
    m:
      - "As far as I know, sir."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    What dost thou think?"
    m:
      - "What are you thinking?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Think, my lord?"
    m:
      - "Thinking, my lord?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "“Think, my lord?” Alas, thou echo’st me"
      - "As if there were some monster in thy thought"
      - "Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something."
      - "I heard thee say even now thou lik’st not that"
      - "When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?"
      - "And when I told thee he was of my counsel"
      - "Of my whole course of wooing, thou cried’st “Indeed?”"
      - "And didst contract and purse thy brow together"
      - "As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain"
      - "Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me"
      - "Show me thy thought."
    m:
      - "“Thinking, my lord?” My God, you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud. You’re thinking something. Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn’t like it when Cassio left my wife. What didn’t you like? And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona, you were like, “Oh, really?” And then you frowned and wrinkled up your foreheard as if you were imagining something horrible. If you’re my friend, tell me what you’re thinking."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "My lord, you know I love you."
    m:
      - "My lord, you know I’m your friend."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "I think thou dost."
      - "And for I know thou ’rt full of love and honesty"
      - "And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath,"
      - "Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more."
      - "For such things in a false disloyal knave"
      - "Are tricks of custom, but in a man that’s just"
      - "They are close dilations, working from the heart,"
      - "That passion cannot rule."
    m:
      - "I think you are. And I know you’re full of love and honesty, and you think carefully before you speak. That’s why these pauses of yours frighten me. If some fool were withholding things from me, I wouldn’t think twice about it. If some lying, cheating villain acted like that, it would just be a trick. But when an honest man acts like that, you know he’s wrestling with bad thoughts and can’t help it."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "    For Michael Cassio,"
      - "I dare be sworn, I think, that he is honest."
    m:
      - "As for Michael Cassio, I think it would be safe for me to swear that he’s honest."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "I think so too."
    m:
      - "I think so too."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "    Men should be what they seem,"
      - "Or those that be not, would they might seem none!"
    m:
      - "People should be what they appear to be. If they’re not honest, they shouldn’t look like they are!"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Certain, men should be what they seem."
    m:
      - "Absolutely, people should be what they appear to be."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Why then I think Cassio’s an honest man."
    m:
      - "In that case, I think Cassio’s an honest man."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Nay, yet there’s more in this."
      - "I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,"
      - "As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts"
      - "The worst of words."
    m:
      - "No, I think there’s more to this than you’re letting on. Please tell me what you’re thinking—even your worst suspicions."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "    Good my lord, pardon me,"
      - "Though I am bound to every act of duty"
      - "I am not bound to that all slaves are free to."
      - "Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false,"
      - "As where’s that palace whereinto foul things"
      - "Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so pure"
      - "Wherein uncleanly apprehensions"
      - "Keep leets and law-days and in sessions sit"
      - "With meditations lawful?"
    m:
      - "Please don’t make me do that, sir. I have to obey all your orders, but surely I’m not obligated to reveal my deepest thoughts—even slaves aren’t expected to do that. You want me to say what I’m thinking? What if my thoughts are disgusting and wrong? Even good people think horrible things sometimes. Who is so pure that they never think a bad thought?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,"
      - "If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear"
      - "A stranger to thy thoughts."
    m:
      - "You’re not being a good friend, Iago, if you even *think* your friend has been wronged and you don’t tell him about it."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "    I do beseech you,"
      - "Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,"
      - "As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague"
      - "To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy"
      - "Shapes faults that are not, that your wisdom,"
      - "From one that so imperfectly conceits,"
      - "Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble"
      - "Out of his scattering and unsure observance."
      - "It were not for your quiet nor your good,"
      - "Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom"
      - "To let you know my thoughts."
    m:
      - "Please don’t ask me to tell you. I might be completely wrong. I have a bad tendency to be suspicious of people and to look too closely into what they’re doing. Often I imagine crimes that aren’t really there. You would be wise to ignore my weak guesses and imaginary suspicions, and don’t worry yourself about the meaningless things I’ve noticed. For me to tell you my thoughts would only destroy your peace of mind, and it wouldn’t be wise, honest, or responsible for me to tell them."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    What dost thou mean?"
    m:
      - "What are you talking about?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,"
      - "Is the immediate jewel of their souls."
      - "Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something, nothing:"
      - "’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands."
      - "But he that filches from me my good name"
      - "Robs me of that which not enriches him"
      - "And makes me poor indeed."
    m:
      - "A good reputation is the most valuable thing we have—men and women alike. If you steal my money, you’re just stealing trash. It’s something, it’s nothing: it’s yours, it’s mine, and it’ll belong to thousands more. But if you steal my reputation, you’re robbing me of something that doesn’t make you richer, but makes me much poorer."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    I’ll know thy thoughts."
    m:
      - "I’m going to find out what you’re thinking."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,"
      - "Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody."
    m:
      - "You can’t find that out, even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn’t make me tell you. And as long my heart’s inside my body, you never will."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Ha!"
    m:
      - "What?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy!"
      - "It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock"
      - "The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss"
      - "Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger,"
      - "But, oh, what damnèd minutes tells he o’er"
      - "Who dotes, yet doubts— suspects, yet soundly loves!"
    m:
      - "Beware of jealousy, my lord! It’s a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours. The man who knows his wife is cheating on him is happy, because at least he isn’t friends with the man she’s sleeping with. But think of the unhappiness of a man who worships his wife, yet doubts her faithfulness. He suspects her, but still loves her."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Oh, misery!"
    m:
      - "Oh, what misery!"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Poor and content is rich, and rich enough,"
      - "But riches fineless is as poor as winter"
      - "To him that ever fears he shall be poor."
      - "Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend"
      - "From jealousy!"
    m:
      - "The person who’s poor and contented is rich enough. But infinite riches are nothing to someone who’s always afraid he’ll be poor. God, help us not be jealous!"

If you say my wife is beautiful, eats well, loves good company, speaks freely, sings, plays music, and dances well, you’re not making me jealous. When a woman is virtuous, talents like these just make her better. And I’m not going to start feeling inferior. She had her eyes wide open when she chose me. No, Iago, I’ll have to see some real evidence before I start suspecting her of anything bad, and when I suspect her, I’ll look for proof, and if there’s proof, that’s when I’ll let go of my love and my jealousy."

    m:
      - "If you’re slandering her just to torture me, then it’ll be no use to pray for mercy or say you’re sorry. You might as well go ahead and commit every unspeakable crime you can think of, because there’s nothing you could that would top what you’ve already done!"

What a horrible world we live in! Listen, pay attention, everybody. It’s not safe to be straightforward and honest. I’m glad you’ve taught me this valuable lesson. From now on, I’ll never try to help a friend when it hurts him so much to hear the truth."

Her reputation was as pure as the snow, but now it’s as dirty and black as my own face. As long as there are ropes, knives, poison, fire, or streams to drown in , I won’t stand for this. Oh, how I wish I knew the truth!"

      - "Which lead directly to the door of truth"
      - "Will give you satisfaction, you may have ’t."
    m:
      - "I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched. If anyone sees them in bed together besides themselves, I guess we could damn them then. So what can we do? What can I say? What proof is there? It’d be impossible for you to watch them, even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks. But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof, we can get that."

    m:
      - "I don’t like what you’re asking me to do. But since I’ve gotten myself involved this far, because I’m so stupidly honest and because I like you so much, I’ll keep going. I recently shared a bed with Cassio, and I couldn’t sleep because of a raging toothache. Well, some people talk in their sleep, and Cassio is one of them. I heard him saying, “Sweet Desdemona, let’s be careful and hide our love,” in his sleep. And then he grabbed my hand and said, “Oh, my darling!” and kissed me hard, as if he were trying to suck my lips off. Then he put his leg over mine, and sighed and kissed me, and said, “Damn fate for giving you to the Moor!”"
