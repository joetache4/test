  - os: "Enter MONTANO and two GENTLEMEN"
    ms: "MONTANO and two GENTLEMEN enter."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "What from the cape can you discern at sea?"
    m:
      - "What can you see out on the ocean?"

  - sp: FIRST GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood."
      - "I cannot ’twixt the heaven and the main"
      - "Descry a sail."
    m:
      - "Nothing. The water’s so rough that I can’t see any sails, either in the bay or on the ocean."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land,"
      - "A fuller blast ne’er shook our battlements."
      - "If it hath ruffianed so upon the sea"
      - "What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,"
      - "Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?"
    m:
      - "It was windy on shore too. A big blast of wind shook our fortifications. How could a ship made out of wood hold together in those mountainous waves? What do you think will be the result of this storm?"

  - sp: SECOND GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "A segregation of the Turkish fleet."
      - "For do but stand upon the foaming shore,"
      - "The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds,"
      - "The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,"
      - "Seems to cast water on the burning bear,"
      - "And quench the guards of th’ ever-fixèd pole."
      - "I never did like molestation view"
      - "On the enchafèd flood."
    m:
      - "The Turkish navy will be broken up. The wind’s whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky. I’ve never seen the waters so disturbed."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "If that the Turkish fleet"
      - "Be not ensheltered and embayed, they are drowned."
      - "It is impossible they bear it out."
    m:
      - "If the Turkish fleet isn’t protected in some harbor, their men must all be drowned. No ship could survive this storm."

  - os: "Enter a THIRD GENTLEMAN"
    ms: "A THIRD GENTLEMAN enters."

  - sp: THIRD GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "News, lads, Our wars are done!"
      - "The desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks,"
      - "That their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice"
      - "Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance"
      - "On most part of their fleet."
    m:
      - "I’ve got news, boys, the war’s over! This terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are ruined. One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "How? Is this true?"
    m:
      - "What? Is this true?"

  - sp: THIRD GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "    The ship is here put in,"
      - "A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,"
      - "Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,"
      - "Is come on shore. The Moor himself at sea"
      - "And is in full commission here for Cyprus."
    m:
      - "The ship’s sailing into harbor now; it’s from Verona. Michael Cassio, lieutenant of the Moor Othello, has arrived on shore. The Moor himself is still at sea. He’s been commissioned to come here to Cyprus."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "I am glad on ’t. ’Tis a worthy governor."
    m:
      - "I’m happy about that. He’ll be a good governor."

  - sp: THIRD GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort"
      - "Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly"
      - "And prays the Moor be safe. For they were parted"
      - "With foul and violent tempest."
    m:
      - "Cassio brings good news about the Turkish defeat, but he’s worried about the Othello’s safety. The two of them were separated during the storm."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "    Pray heavens he be,"
      - "For I have served him, and the man commands"
      - "Like a full soldier. Let’s to the seaside, ho!"
      - "As well to see the vessel that’s come in"
      - "As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,"
      - "Even till we make the main and th’ aerial blue"
      - "An indistinct regard."
    m:
      - "I hope to God Othello’s all right. I served under him, and I know what an excellent commander he is. Let’s go to the shore to get a look at the ship that came in, and to look out for Othello’s ship. We’ll stare out at the sea until the sea and the sky blur together."

  - sp: THIRD GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "    Come, let’s do so."
      - "For every minute is expectancy"
      - "Of more arrivance."
    m:
      - "Let’s do that. Every minute we expect more ships to arrive."

  - os: "Enter CASSIO"
    ms: "CASSIO enters."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle"
      - "That so approve the Moor. Oh, let the heavens"
      - "Give him defense against the elements,"
      - "For I have lost him on a dangerous sea."
    m:
      - "Thanks, you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello. I hope heaven protects him from the weather, because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "Is he well shipped?"
    m:
      - "Is his ship sturdy?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "His bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot"
      - "Of very expert and approved allowance"
      - "Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,"
      - "Stand in bold cure."
    m:
      - "Yes, it’s well built, and the ship’s pilot is very expert and experienced. For that reason I still have some hope for him, even though I don’t have my hopes up too high."

  - sp: A VOICE
    o:
      - "*(within)* A sail, a sail, a sail!"
    m:
      - "*(offstage)* A sail! A sail! A sail!"

  - os: "Enter a MESSENGER"
    ms: "A MESSENGER enters."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "What noise?"
    m:
      - "What’s all that shouting about?"

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "The town is empty. On the brow o’ th’ sea"
      - "Stand ranks of people, and they cry “A sail!”"
    m:
      - "Everybody in town is down at the shore shouting “A sail!”"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "My hopes do shape him for the governor."
    m:
      - "I hope it’s Othello."

  - os: "A shot"
    ms: "A shot is heard."

  - sp: SECOND GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "They do discharge their shot of courtesy."
      - "Our friends at least."
    m:
      - "They’ve fired a greeting shot, so at least it’s a friendly ship."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "I pray you sir, go forth"
      - "And give us truth who ’tis that is arrived."
    m:
      - "Please go find out for certain who has arrived."

  - sp: SECOND GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "I shall."
    m:
      - "I’ll do that."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "SECOND GENTLEMAN exits."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "But good lieutenant, is your general wived?"
    m:
      - "Good lieutenant, is your general married?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Most fortunately. He hath achieved a maid"
      - "That paragons description and wild fame,"
      - "One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,"
      - "And in th’ essential vesture of creation"
      - "Does tire the ingener."
    m:
      - "Yes, and he’s very lucky to have married the woman he did. His wife defies description. She’s God’s masterpiece, and she’d exhaust whoever tried to do her justice while praising her."

  - os: "Enter SECOND GENTLEMAN"
    ms: "The SECOND GENTLEMAN enters."

  - o:
      - "How now? Who has put in?"
    m:
      - "Who’s arrived in the harbor?"

  - sp: SECOND GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "’Tis one Iago, ancient to the general."
    m:
      - "A man named Iago, the general’s ensign."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "He’s had most favorable and happy speed."
      - "Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,"
      - "The guttered rocks and congregated sands,"
      - "Traitors ensteeped to enclog the guiltless keel,"
      - "As having sense of beauty, do omit"
      - "Their mortal natures, letting go safely by"
      - "The divine Desdemona."
    m:
      - "He made good time. You see how the storm, the jagged rocks, and the sand banks that trap ships all appreciate a beautiful woman. They let the heavenly Desdemona arrive safe and sound."

  - sp: MONTANO
    o:
      - "What is she?"
    m:
      - "Who’s that?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "She that I spake of, our great captain’s captain,"
      - "Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,"
      - "Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts"
      - "A se’nnight’s speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,"
      - "And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,"
      - "That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,"
      - "Make love’s quick pants in Desdemona’s arms,"
      - "Give renewed fire to our extincted spirits"
      - "And bring all Cyprus comfort!"
    m:
      - "She’s the one I was talking about, the general’s wife. The brave Iago was put in charge of bringing her here, and he’s arrived a week sooner than we expected. Dear God, please protect Othello and help him arrive here safely, so he and Desdemona can be in each other’s arms, and Othello can cheer us up and bring comfort to Cyprus."

  - os: "Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO with attendants"
    ms: "DESDEMONA, IAGO, RODERIGO and EMILIA enter."

  - o:
      - "    Oh, behold,"
      - "The riches of the ship is come on shore!"
      - "You men of Cyprus, let her have your knees."
      - "Hail to thee, lady, and the grace of heaven,"
      - "Before, behind thee, and on every hand,"
      - "Enwheel thee round!"
    m:
      - "Look, the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore. We should all kneel before her, men of Cyprus! Greetings, my lady, and may God always be with you."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "I thank you, valiant Cassio."
      - "What tidings can you tell me of my lord?"
    m:
      - "Thank you, brave Cassio. Is there any news about my husband?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "He is not yet arrived. Nor know I aught"
      - "But that he’s well and will be shortly here."
    m:
      - "He hasn’t arrived yet. As far as I know, he’s okay and will arrive here soon."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Oh, but I fear. How lost you company?"
    m:
      - "Oh, but I’m worried. How did you two get separated?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "The great contention of the sea and skies"
      - "Parted our fellowship—"
    m:
      - "The storm separated us."

  - sp: A VOICE
    o:
      - "*(within)* A sail, a sail!"
    m:
      - "*(offstage)* A sail! A sail!"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "But, hark! a sail."
    m:
      - "Listen, they’ve spotted another ship!"

  - os: "A shot"
    ms: "A gunshot is heard."

  - sp: SECOND GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "They give this greeting to the citadel."
      - "This likewise is a friend."
    m:
      - "They fired a greeting shot too, so this is also a friendly ship."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "    See for the news."
    m:
      - "Go find out the news."

  - os: "Exit a SECOND GENTLEMEN"
    ms: "SECOND GENTLEMAN exits."

  - o:
      - "Good ancient, you are welcome.—Welcome, mistress."
      - "*(kisses EMILIA)*"
      - "Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,"
      - "That I extend my manners. ’Tis my breeding"
      - "That gives me this bold show of courtesy."
    m:
      - "Ensign Iago, welcome.—And welcome to you, too, madam.     *(he kisses EMILIA)* Don’t be upset that I kissed your wife hello, Iago. It’s a courtesy where I come from."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Sir, would she give you so much of her lips"
      - "As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,"
      - "You’ll have enough."
    m:
      - "If she gave you as much lip as she gives me, you’d be sick of her by now."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Alas, she has no speech!"
    m:
      - "On the contrary, she’s a soft-spoken woman."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "In faith, too much."
      - "I find it still, when I have leave to sleep."
      - "Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,"
      - "She puts her tongue a little in her heart"
      - "And chides with thinking."
    m:
      - "No, she talks too much. She’s always talking when I want to sleep. I admit that in front of you, my lady, she keeps a bit quiet. But she’s scolding me silently."

  - sp: EMILIA
    o:
      - "    You have little cause to say so."
    m:
      - "You have no reason to say that."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Come on, come on. You are pictures out of door, bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens, saints in your injuries, devils being offended, players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds."
    m:
      - "Come on, come on. You women are all the same. You’re as pretty as pictures when you’re out in public, but in your own houses you’re as noisy as jangling bells. In your own kitchens you act like wildcats. You make yourselves sound like saints when you’re complaining about something, but you act like devils when someone offends you. You don’t take your jobs as housewives seriously, and you’re shameless hussies in bed."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Oh, fie upon thee, slanderer!"
    m:
      - "Shame on you, you slanderer!"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk."
      - "You rise to play and go to bed to work."
    m:
      - "No, it’s true, or if it’s not, I’m a villain. You wake up to have fun, and you start work when you go to bed."

  - sp: EMILIA
    o:
      - "You shall not write my praise."
    m:
      - "You clearly have nothing good to say about me."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "    No, let me not."
    m:
      - "No, I don’t."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "What wouldst thou write of me, if thou should’st praise me?"
    m:
      - "But if you had to say something nice about me, what would you say?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "O gentle lady, do not put me to ’t,"
      - "For I am nothing, if not critical."
    m:
      - "Don’t make me do it, my lady. I’m critical by nature."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Come on, assay. There’s one gone to the harbor?"
    m:
      - "Come on, just try.—By the way, has someone gone down to the harbor?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Ay, madam."
    m:
      - "Yes, madam."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "I am not merry, but I do beguile"
      - "The thing I am by seeming otherwise."
      - "Come, how wouldst thou praise me?"
    m:
      - "I’m not as happy as I seem. I’m just trying not to show how worried I am about Othello’s safety. Come on, what would you say about me?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "I am about it, but indeed my invention"
      - "Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze,"
      - "It plucks out brains and all. But my Muse labors"
      - "And thus she is delivered:"
      - "If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,"
      - "The one’s for use, the other useth it."
    m:
      - "I’m trying to think of something, but I’m not good at inventing clever things. It takes time. Ah, I’ve got it. If a woman is pretty and smart, she uses her good looks to get what she wants."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Well praised! How if she be black and witty?"
    m:
      - "Very clever! But what if the woman is smart but ugly?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "If she be black, and thereto have a wit,"
      - "She’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit."
    m:
      - "Even if she’s ugly, she’ll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Worse and worse!"
    m:
      - "This is getting worse and worse!"

  - sp: EMILIA
    o:
      - "    How if fair and foolish?"
    m:
      - "What if she’s pretty but stupid?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "She never yet was foolish that was fair,"
      - "For even her folly helped her to an heir."
    m:
      - "No pretty woman is stupid, because her stupidity will make her more attractive to men."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i’ th’ alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her That’s foul and foolish?"
    m:
      - "These are stupid old jokes that men tell each other in bars. What horrible thing do you have to say about a woman who’s both ugly and stupid?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "There’s none so foul and foolish thereunto,"
      - "But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do."
    m:
      - "No matter how ugly or stupid the woman is, she plays the same dirty tricks that the smart and pretty ones do."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Oh, heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?"
    m:
      - "You don’t know a thing! You give your best praise to the worst women. But how would you praise a truly good woman, someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "She that was ever fair and never proud,"
      - "Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,"
      - "Never lacked gold and yet went never gay,"
      - "Fled from her wish and yet said “Now I may,”"
      - "She that being angered, her revenge being nigh,"
      - "Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,"
      - "She that in wisdom never was so frail"
      - "To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail,"
      - "She that could think and ne’er disclose her mind,"
      - "See suitors following and not look behind,"
      - "She was a wight, if ever such wights were—"
    m:
      - "A woman who was beautiful but never proud, who could speak well but knew when to be quiet, who dressed well but was never overdressed, who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted, a woman who never took revenge, who overlooked it when people hurt her, who was too wise to do anything stupid, who could think without revealing her thoughts, and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her, that kind of woman, if she ever existed, would—"

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "To do what?"
    m:
      - "Would do what?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "To suckle fools and chronicle small beer."
    m:
      - "Would raise babies and clip coupons."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Oh, most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cassio? Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor?"
    m:
      - "Oh, that’s pathetic! Don’t listen to him, Emilia, even though he’s your husband. What do you think about him, Cassio? Isn’t he a horrible man?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar."
    m:
      - "He speaks bluntly, madam. He’s more of a soldier than a wise man."

  - os: "CASSIO takes DESDEMONA’S hand"
    ms: "CASSIO takes DESDEMONA’S hand."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "*(aside)* He takes her by the palm. Ay, well said, whisper! With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do, I will gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, ’Tis so, indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good, well kissed, and excellent courtesy! ’tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers to your lips? Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!—"
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* He’s taking her hand. That’s right, go ahead and whisper together. This is all I need to get Cassio. Yes, keep smiling at her, Cassio. Your fine manners around women will be your downfall. Oh, I’m sure you’re saying something very clever. If you lose your job because of little flirtations like this, you’ll wish you hadn’t been so courteous with her. Oh, how nice, you’re kissing your own hand, one finger at a time? I wish those fingers were enema tubes!—"

  - os: "Trumpet within"
    ms: "A trumpet plays offstage."

  - o:
      - "The Moor! I know his trumpet."
    m:

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "    ’Tis truly so."
    m:
      - "Yes, it is."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Let’s meet him and receive him."
    m:
      - "Let’s go greet him when he lands."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "    Lo, where he comes!"
    m:
      - "Look, here he comes."

  - os: "Enter OTHELLO and attendants"
    ms: "OTHELLO enters with attendants."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:

    m:
      - "My beautiful warrior!"

  - sp: DESDEMONA

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:

      - "To see you here before me. Oh, my soul’s joy!"
      - "If after every tempest come such calms,"
      - "May the winds blow till they have wakened death,"
      - "And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas"
      - "Olympus-high, and duck again as low"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies. To love him still for prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed, and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be a game to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners and beauties. All which the Moor is defective in. Now for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor. Very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now sir, this granted—as it is a most pregnant and unforced position—who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble, no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection. Why, none, why, none! A slipper and subtle knave, a finder of occasions that has an eye, can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself. A devilish knave. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after. A pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already."
    m:
      - "Be quiet and listen to me. Remember how she fell madly in love with the Moor because he bragged and told her made-up stories? Did you expect her to keep on loving him for his chattering? You’re too smart to think that. No, she needs someone nice-looking. Othello’s ugly, what pleasure could she find in him? Lovemaking gets boring after a while. To keep things hot, she’ll need to see someone with a handsome face, someone close to her in age, someone who looks and acts like her. Othello isn’t any of those things. Since he doesn’t have these advantages to make him attractive to her, she’ll get sick of him until he makes her want to puke. She’ll start looking around for a second choice. Now, if that’s true—and it’s obviously true—who’s in a better position than Cassio? He’s a smooth talker, and uses sophistication and fine manners to hide his lust. Nobody’s as crafty as he is. Besides, he’s young and handsome, and he’s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for. He’s a bad boy, and Desdemona’s got her eye on him already."

    o:
      - "Blessed fig’s-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?"
    m:
      - "Like hell she is! She’s made of the same flesh and blood as everyone else. If she were so moral, she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place. Good lord! Did you notice how she and Cassio were fondling each other’s hands? Did you see that?"

  - sp: RODERIGO
    o:
      - "Yes, that I did, but that was but courtesy."

Villainous thoughts, Roderigo! When these mutabilities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, th’ incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight for the command, I’ll lay ’t upon you. Cassio knows you not. I’ll not be far from you. Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister."
    m:
      - "They were lusting after each other. You could tell by how they were acting that they’re going to be lovers. They were so close that their breath was mingling. When two people get that intimate, sex will soon follow. Disgusting! But listen to me; let me guide you. I brought you here from Venice. Be on guard duty tonight. I’ll put you in charge. Cassio doesn’t know you. I’ll be nearby. Make Cassio angry somehow, either by speaking too loud, or insulting his military skills, or however else you want."

For even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity."
    m:
      - "He’s hot-tempered, and he might try to hit you with his staff. Try to get him to do that. That’ll allow me to stir up public sentiment against him here in Cyprus. I’ll get them so riled up that they’ll only calm down when Cassio’s fired. To get what you want, you need to get Cassio out of the way. If you don’t do that, things are hopeless for you."

He’d probably be a good husband to Desdemona. I love her too, not simply out of lust, but also to feed my revenge. I have a feeling the Moor slept with my wife. That thought keeps gnawing at me, eating me up inside. I won’t be satisfied until I get even with him, wife for wife. If I can’t do that, I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can’t think straight. If that piece of Venetian trash Roderigo can do what I need to carry out my plan, I’ll have power over Cassio. I’ll say bad things about him to the Moor. I have a feeling Cassio seduced my wife as well. I’ll make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me, even though the joke will be on him the whole time. I’ve got a good plan, though I haven’t worked out the details yet. You can never see the end of an evil plan until the moment comes."
