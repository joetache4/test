  - os: "Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians"
    ms: "CORIOLANUS enters with Noblemen."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Let them puff all about mine ears, present me"
      - "Death on the wheel or at wild horses’ heels,"
      - "Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,"
      - "That the precipitation might down stretch"
      - "Below the beam of sight, yet will I still"
      - "Be thus to them."
    m:
      - "Let them shout their fury. They can put me to death on the wheel, let wild horses drag me, or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock, making the fall so far that you can’t see the bottom. It won’t change who I am compared to them."

  - sp: A PATRICIAN
    o:
      - "You do the nobler."
    m:
      - "You are nobler than they are."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "I muse my mother"
      - "Does not approve me further, who was wont"
      - "To call them woollen vassals, things created"
      - "To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads"
      - "In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,"
      - "When one but of my ordinance stood up"
      - "To speak of peace or war."
    m:
      - "I wonder if my mother still sides with me. She used to call them slaves in rough wool clothes, traders of cheap items who were always taking their hats off to those of higher rank and whose jaws dropped in silent amazement when someone like me made speeches about peace or war."

  - os: "Enter VOLUMNIA"
    ms: "VOLUMNIA enters."

  - o:
      - "I talk of you:"
      - "Why did you wish me milder? would you have me"
      - "False to my nature? Rather say I play"
      - "The man I am."
    m:
      - "I’m talking about you. Why did you want me to be more subdued? Would you have me be untrue to my nature? Would you rather I pretend to be someone else?"

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "O, sir, sir, sir,"
      - "I would have had you put your power well on,"
      - "Before you had worn it out."
    m:
      - "Oh, sir, sir, sir, I wanted your power to be made official before you used it up."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Let go."
    m:
      - "Stop it."

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "You might have been enough the man you are,"
      - "With striving less to be so; lesser had been"
      - "The thwartings of your dispositions, if"
      - "You had not show’d them how ye were disposed"
      - "Ere they lack’d power to cross you."
    m:
      - "You would’ve been enough of a man without fighting so hard to prove yourself. The people wouldn’t have condemned you if you hadn’t shown them your true disposition before they lost the power to stop you."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Let them hang."
    m:
      - "Let them hang."

  - sp: A PATRICIAN
    o:
      - "Ay, and burn too."
    m:
      - "Yes, and burn, too."

  - os: "Enter MENENIUS and Senators"
    ms: "MENENIUS and Senators enter."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Come, come, you have been too rough, something"
      - "too rough;"
      - "You must return and mend it."
    m:
      - "Come, come, you’ve been a bit too rough. You must go back and fix things with the people."

  - sp: FIRST SENATOR
    o:
      - "There’s no remedy;"
      - "Unless, by not so doing, our good city"
      - "Cleave in the midst, and perish."
    m:
      - "There’s no remedy. Unless you go, our good city will break in two and be ruined."

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "Pray, be counsell’d:"
      - "I have a heart as little apt as yours,"
      - "But yet a brain that leads my use of anger"
      - "To better vantage."
    m:
      - "Please, listen to this advice. I’m as stubborn as you are, but I’m smart enough to use my anger to my advantage."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Well said, noble woman!"
      - "Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that"
      - "The violent fit o’ the time craves it as physic"
      - "For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,"
      - "Which I can scarcely bear."
    m:
      - "Well said, noble woman. Before he returns to the masses, given the current violent climate in the state, which demands a solution to this problem, I’d like to put my armor on, even though I am barely strong enough to wear it."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "What must I do?"
    m:
      - "What should I do?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Return to the tribunes."
    m:
      - "Return to the tribunes."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Well, what then? what then?"
    m:
      - "And then what?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Repent what you have spoke."
    m:
      - "Take back what you said."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "For them! I cannot do it to the gods;"
      - "Must I then do’t to them?"
    m:
      - "For them! I can’t take back what I’ve said to the gods, but I must I take back what I’ve said to the people?"

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "You are too absolute;"
      - "Though therein you can never be too noble,"
      - "But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,"
      - "Honour and policy, like unsever’d friends,"
      - "I’ the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,"
      - "In peace what each of them by the other lose,"
      - "That they combine not there."
    m:
      - "You’re too rigid. You can never be too noble, except in extreme circumstances. I’ve heard you say that in war, honor and strategy go together. If that’s the case, tell me, why wouldn’t they also go together in times of peace?"

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Tush, tush!"
    m:
      - "Hush, hush!"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "A good demand."
    m:
      - "That’s a good question."

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "If it be honour in your wars to seem"
      - "The same you are not, which, for your best ends,"
      - "You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,"
      - "That it shall hold companionship in peace"
      - "With honour, as in war, since that to both"
      - "It stands in like request?"
    m:
      - "If it’s honorable in war to pretend to be other than how you are, if it serves your end goal, why is it less honorable to do so in times of peace?"

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Why force you this?"
    m:
      - "Why do you ask?"

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "Because that now it lies you on to speak"
      - "To the people; not by your own instruction,"
      - "Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,"
      - "But with such words that are but rooted in"
      - "Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables"
      - "Of no allowance to your bosom’s truth."
      - "Now, this no more dishonours you at all"
      - "Than to take in a town with gentle words,"
      - "Which else would put you to your fortune and"
      - "The hazard of much blood."
      - "I would dissemble with my nature where"
      - "My fortunes and my friends at stake required"
      - "I should do so in honour: I am in this,"
      - "Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;"
      - "And you will rather show our general louts"
      - "How you can frown than spend a fawn upon ’em,"
      - "For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard"
      - "Of what that want might ruin."
    m:
      - "Because you have to speak to the people now—and not to give them instructions or to talk from your heart. What you say can’t reflect the truth of what you really feel. However, this doesn’t dishonor you any more than it would to capture a town with flattering words, a town that would otherwise take your fortune and spill your blood. I would feel it honorable to hide my real nature if my fortune and my friends were at risk. I speak for your wife, your son, these senators, and the nobles about this: you’d prefer to show the miserable commoners how you frown than flatter them in any way, even for the sake of their approval and to protect what might be ruined without it."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Noble lady!"
      - "Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,"
      - "Not what is dangerous present, but the loss"
      - "Of what is past."
    m:
      - "Noble lady! Come with us. Your honest words may heal not only present dangers but also past losses."

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "I prithee now, my son,"
      - "Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;"
      - "And thus far having stretch’d it—here be with them—"
      - "Thy knee bussing the stones—for in such business"
      - "Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant"
      - "More learned than the ears—waving thy head,"
      - "Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,"
      - "Now humble as the ripest mulberry"
      - "That will not hold the handling: or say to them,"
      - "Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils"
      - "Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,"
      - "Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,"
      - "In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame"
      - "Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far"
      - "As thou hast power and person."
    m:
      - "I beg you now, my son, go to them, with your hat in your hand. And once you’ve extended your hat to them—do what they ask—get on your knees and kiss the ground, bow your head and humble your proud heart like the ripest mulberry that falls from the branch the moment it’s touched—for in this situation actions speak louder than words. Or tell them that you are their soldier and admit that because you were raised on the battlefield, you never learned a gentle way with words, but you realize you should have spoken more kindly when asking for their votes. Tell them that you’ll work for their benefit from here on out, to the extent of your political power and physical ability."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "This but done,"
      - "Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;"
      - "For they have pardons, being ask’d, as free"
      - "As words to little purpose."
    m:
      - "*(to Coriolanus)* Do as she says, and their hearts will belong to you. If you ask, they’ll pardon you as easily as they speak their nonsense."

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "Prithee now,"
      - "Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather"
      - "Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf"
      - "Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius."
    m:
      - "Please, go now. Submit to them, although I know you’d rather pursue your enemy through the fires of hell than flatter him in a boudoir. Here’s Cominius."

  - os: "Enter COMINIUS"
    ms: "COMINIUS enters."

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:
      - "I have been i’ the market-place; and, sir, ’tis fit"
      - "You make strong party, or defend yourself"
      - "By calmness or by absence: all’s in anger."
    m:
      - "Sir, I’ve been in the marketplace. You’ll need to argue your case strongly or defend yourself with calmness—or don’t come at all. Everyone is angry."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Only fair speech."
    m:
      - "Just speak kindly."

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:
      - "I think ’twill serve, if he"
      - "Can thereto frame his spirit."
    m:
      - "I think that’ll work, if he can control his temper."

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "He must, and will"
      - "Prithee now, say you will, and go about it."
    m:
      - "He must, and I beg you, say you will and then go do it."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?"
      - "Must I with base tongue give my noble heart"
      - "A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do’t:"
      - "Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,"
      - "This mould of Martius, they to dust should grind it"
      - "And throw’t against the wind. To the market-place!"
      - "You have put me now to such a part which never"
      - "I shall discharge to the life."
    m:
      - "Do I have to show them my head without a helmet? Do I have to betray my heart and speak words that are lies? Well, I’ll do it. But if I lose, they’ll grind me into dust and throw it against the wind. To the marketplace! You’re asking me to play a part that I will never play convincingly."

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:
      - "Come, come, we’ll prompt you."
    m:
      - "Come, come, we’ll tell you what to say."

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said"
      - "My praises made thee first a soldier, so,"
      - "To have my praise for this, perform a part"
      - "Thou hast not done before."
    m:
      - "I beg you now, sweet son. You’ve said that my encouragement is what made you into a soldier, so I encourage you now to play this new role."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Well, I must do’t:"
      - "Away, my disposition, and possess me"
      - "Some harlot’s spirit! my throat of war be turn’d,"
      - "Which quired with my drum, into a pipe"
      - "Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice"
      - "That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves"
      - "Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys’ tears take up"
      - "The glasses of my sight! a beggar’s tongue"
      - "Make motion through my lips, and my arm’d knees,"
      - "Who bow’d but in my stirrup, bend like his"
      - "That hath received an alms! I will not do’t,"
      - "Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth"
      - "And by my body’s action teach my mind"
      - "A most inherent baseness."
    m:
      - "Well, I must do it. I’ll hide my true nature and become like a whore! My voice, which ordinarily calls for war, will harmonize with my drum and become the voice of a eunuch or a virgin that sings babies to sleep! I’ll smile like a servant, cry like a schoolboy, and speak like a beggar! My armored knees, which ordinarily only bend in my saddle, will bend like a man receiving alms! I won’t do it because it will dishonor my true nature, and what I do with my body will degrade my mind."

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "At thy choice, then:"
      - "To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour"
      - "Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let"
      - "Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear"
      - "Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death"
      - "With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list"
      - "Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck’dst it from me,"
      - "But owe thy pride thyself."
    m:
      - "This is your choice then. It is more dishonorable for me to have to beg you than for you to have to beg them. Everything will be ruined. I’d rather endure the consequences of challenging your pride rather than be afraid of it, for I fear death as little as you do. Do as you please. Your courage comes from me—you sucked it from me as a nursing baby—but your pride is all your own."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Pray, be content:"
      - "Mother, I am going to the market-place;"
      - "Chide me no more. I’ll mountebank their loves,"
      - "Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved"
      - "Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:"
      - "Commend me to my wife. I’ll return consul;"
      - "Or never trust to what my tongue can do"
      - "I’ the way of flattery further."
    m:
      - "That’s enough, mother. I’m going to the marketplace. Don’t scold me any further. I’ll deceive them into liking me, steal their hearts, and come home beloved by all the tradesmen in Rome. Look, I’m going. Give my regards to my wife. I’ll come back as consul. Never again doubt how well my tongue can flatter."

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "Do your will."
    m:
      - "Do what you need to do."

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:
      - "Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself"
      - "To answer mildly; for they are prepared"
      - "With accusations, as I hear, more strong"
      - "Than are upon you yet."
    m:
      - "Go! The tribunes are waiting for you. Be prepared to answer questions mildly. I’ve heard that they have even stronger accusations than the ones they’ve made so far."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "The word is “mildly.” Pray you, let us go:"
      - "Let them accuse me by invention, I"
      - "Will answer in mine honour."
    m:
      - "The key word is “mild.” Please, let’s go. Let them invent accusations against me, and I’ll answer honorably."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Ay, but mildly."
    m:
      - "Yes, but mildly."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:

    m:
