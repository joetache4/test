  - os: "Enter OTHELLO and IAGO"
    ms: "OTHELLO and IAGO enter."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Will you think so?"
    m:
      - "Do you really think so?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    Think so, Iago?"
    m:
      - "What do you mean, do I think so?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "    What,"
      - "To kiss in private?"
    m:
      - "What, just because they kissed in private?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "  An unauthorized kiss!"
    m:
      - "An illicit kiss!"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Or to be naked with her friend in bed"
      - "An hour or more, not meaning any harm?"
    m:
      - "Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so, but they didn’t do anything."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!"
      - "It is hypocrisy against the devil."
      - "They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,"
      - "The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven."
    m:
      - "Naked in bed together, but without doing anything? Come on, Iago. That would be like playing a trick on the devil: they’d make him think they’re going to commit adultery, but then back off. Anyone who acted like that would be letting the devil tempt them, and tempting God to condemn them."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "So they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip."
      - "But if I give my wife a handkerchief—"
    m:
      - "As long as they didn’t do anything, it would only be a minor sin. But if I gave my wife a handkerchief—"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "What then?"
    m:
      - "Then what?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Why then ’tis hers, my lord, and, being hers,"
      - "She may, I think, bestow ’t on any man."
    m:
      - "Then it’s hers. And if it’s hers, I guess she can give it to any man she wants."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "She is protectress of her honor too."
      - "May she give that?"
    m:
      - "Her reputation is also her own. Can she give that away too?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Her honor is an essence that’s not seen,"
      - "They have it very oft that have it not."
      - "But for the handkerchief—"
    m:
      - "You can’t see a reputation. A lot of people don’t even deserve the reputations they have. But a handkerchief—"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it."
      - "Thou saidst—Oh, it comes o’er my memory,"
      - "As doth the raven o’er the infectious house,"
      - "Boding to all—he had my handkerchief."
    m:
      - "God, I wish I could forget about the handkerchief! What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare—he’s got my handkerchief!"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Ay, what of that?"
    m:
      - "Yes, what about it?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "  That’s not so good now."
    m:
      - "That’s not good."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?"
      - "Or heard him say—as knaves be such abroad,"
      - "Who having, by their own importunate suit,"
      - "Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,"
      - "Convincèd or supplied them, cannot choose"
      - "But they must blab—"
    m:
      - "What if I’d said I saw him do something to hurt you? Or heard him say something about it. You know there are jerks out there who have to brag about bedding some woman.—"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    Hath he said any thing?"
    m:
      - "Has he said anything?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "He hath, my lord, but be you well assured"
      - "No more than he’ll unswear."
    m:
      - "Yes, but he’d deny it all."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    What hath he said?"
    m:
      - "What did he say?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Why, that he did—I know not what he did."
    m:
      - "He said he did—I don’t know."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "What? what?"
    m:
      - "He what?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "  Lie—"
    m:
      - "He was in bed with—"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "  With her?"
    m:
      - "With her?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "    With her, on her, what you will."
    m:
      - "With her, on top of her—however you want to say it."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Lie with her? lie on her? We say “lie on her” when they belie her! Lie with her—that’s fulsome. Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief! To confess, and be hanged for his labor. First to be hanged, and then to confess—I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. Is ’t possible? Confess!—Handkerchief!—Oh, devil!—"
    m:
      - "In bed with her? On top of her? I would have thought people were telling lies about her rather than believe he was lying on her. My God, it’s nauseating! Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief! I’ll kill him first, and then let him confess—I’m trembling with rage. I wouldn’t be trembling like this if I didn’t know deep down this was all true. Noses, ears, lips. Is it possible? Tell me the truth—Handkerchief—Damn it!"

  - os: "*(falls in a trance)*"
    ms: "*(he falls into a trance)*"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Work on, My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,"
      - "And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,"
      - "All guiltless, meet reproach.—What, ho! My lord!"
      - "My lord, I say! Othello!"
    m:
      - "Keep working, poison! This is the way to trick gullible fools. Many good and innocent women are punished for reasons like this.—My lord? My lord, Othello!"

  - os: "Enter CASSIO"
    ms: "CASSIO enters."

  - o:
      - "    How now, Cassio!"
    m:
      - "Hey, Cassio!"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "What’s the matter?"
    m:
      - "What’s the matter?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "My lord is fall’n into an epilepsy."
      - "This is his second fit. He had one yesterday."
    m:
      - "Othello’s having some kind of epileptic fit. This is his second fit like this. He had one yesterday."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Rub him about the temples."
    m:
      - "Rub his temples."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "    No, forbear."
      - "The lethargy must have his quiet course."
      - "If not, he foams at mouth and by and by"
      - "Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs."
      - "Do you withdraw yourself a little while,"
      - "He will recover straight. When he is gone"
      - "I would on great occasion speak with you."
    m:
      - "No, don’t. This fit has to run its course. If you interrupt it, he’ll foam at the mouth and go crazy. Look, he’s moving. Why don’t you go away for a bit? He’ll get better right away. When he leaves, it’s very important that I talk to you."

  - os: "Exit CASSIO"
    ms: "CASSIO exits."

  - o:
      - "How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?"
    m:
      - "What happened, general? Did you hit your head?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Dost thou mock me?"
    m:
      - "Are you making fun of me?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "    I mock you not, by heaven."
      - "Would you would bear your fortune like a man!"
    m:
      - "Making fun of you? No, I swear! I wish you could face your bad news like a man!"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "A hornèd man’s a monster and a beast."
    m:
      - "A man who’s been cheated on isn’t a real man. He’s subhuman, like an animal."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "There’s many a beast then in a populous city,"
      - "And many a civil monster."
    m:
      - "In that case there are a lot of animals on the loose in this city."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Did he confess it?"
    m:
      - "Did he confess?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "  Good sir, be a man,"
      - "Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked"
      - "May draw with you. There’s millions now alive"
      - "That nightly lie in those unproper beds"
      - "Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better."
      - "Oh, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock,"
      - "To lip a wanton in a secure couch,"
      - "And to suppose her chaste. No, let me know,"
      - "And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be."
    m:
      - "Sir, be a man. Every married man has been cheated on. Millions of men sleep with wives who cheat on them, wrongly believing they belong to them alone. Your case is better than that. At least you’re not ignorant. The worst thing of all is to kiss your wife thinking she’s innocent, when in fact she’s a whore. No, I’d rather know the truth. Then I’ll know exactly what she is, just as I know what I am."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Oh, thou art wise! ’Tis certain."
    m:
      - "You’re wise! That’s for sure."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "    Stand you awhile apart,"
      - "Confine yourself but in a patient list."
      - "Whilst you were here o’erwhelmèd with your grief—"
      - "A passion most resulting such a man—"
      - "Cassio came hither. I shifted him away"
      - "And laid good ’scuses upon your ecstasy,"
      - "Bade him anon return and here speak with me,"
      - "The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,"
      - "And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns"
      - "That dwell in every region of his face."
      - "For I will make him tell the tale anew"
      - "Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when"
      - "He hath, and is again to cope your wife."
      - "I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,"
      - "Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,"
      - "And nothing of a man."
    m:
      - "Go somewhere else for a while. Calm down. While you were dazed by grief—which isn’t appropriate for a man like you—Cassio showed up here. I got him to leave, and made up an excuse for your trance. I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit, and he promised he would. So hide here and watch how he sneers at you. I’ll make him tell me the whole story again—where, how often, how long ago—and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future. I’m telling you, just watch his face. But stay calm, and don’t get carried away by rage, or I’ll think you’re not a man."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    Dost thou hear, Iago?"
      - "I will be found most cunning in my patience,"
      - "But—dost thou hear?—most bloody."
    m:
      - "Do you hear what I’m saying, Iago? I’ll be very patient, but—do you hear me?—I’m not done with him yet"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "    That’s not amiss,"
      - "But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?"
    m:
      - "That’s fine, but for now keep your cool. Will you go hide?"

  - os: "OTHELLO withdraws"
    ms: "OTHELLO hides."

  - o:
      - "Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,"
      - "A huswife that by selling her desires"
      - "Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature"
      - "That dotes on Cassio, as ’tis the strumpet’s plague"
      - "To beguile many and be beguiled by one."
      - "He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain"
      - "From the excess of laughter. Here he comes."
    m:
      - "Now I’ll ask Cassio about Bianca, a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes. She’s crazy about Cassio. That’s the whore’s curse, to seduce many men, but to be seduced by one. Whenever he talks about her he can’t stop laughing."

  - os: "Enter CASSIO"
    ms: "CASSIO enters."

  - o:
      - "As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad."
      - "And his unbookish jealousy must construe"
      - "Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behavior"
      - "Quite in the wrong.—How do you now, lieutenant?"
    m:
      - "And when he laughs, Othello will go crazy. In his ignorant jealousy, he’ll totally misunderstand Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and jokes.—How are you, lieutenant?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "The worser that you give me the addition"
      - "Whose want even kills me."
    m:
      - "It doesn’t make me feel any better when you call me lieutenant. I’m dying to have that title back again."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on ’t."
      - "Now if this suit lay in Bianca’s power"
      - "How quickly should you speed!"
    m:
      - "Just keep asking Desdemona, and it’ll be yours. If it was up to Bianca to get you your job back, you’d have had it already!"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "    Alas, poor caitiff!"
    m:
      - "The poor thing!"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Look how he laughs already!"
    m:
      - "He’s laughing already!"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "I never knew woman love man so."
    m:
      - "I never knew a woman who loved a man so much."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Alas, poor rogue, I think indeed she loves me."
    m:
      - "The poor thing, I really think she loves me."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out."
    m:
      - "Now he denies it a bit, and tries to laugh it off."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Do you hear, Cassio?"
    m:
      - "Have you heard this, Cassio?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    Now he importunes him"
      - "To tell it o’er. Go to, well said, well said."
    m:
      - "He’s asking him to tell the story again. Go on, tell it."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "She gives it out that you shall marry her."
      - "Do you intend it?"
    m:
      - "She says you’re going to marry her. Are you?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Ha, ha, ha!"
    m:
      - "Ha, ha, ha!"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Do ye triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?"
    m:
      - "Are you laughing because you’ve won? Do you think you’ve won?"

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "I marry her! What? A customer? Prithee bear some charity to my wit. Do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!"
    m:
      - "Me, marry her? That whore? Please give me a little credit! I’m not that stupid. Ha, ha, ha!"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "So, so, so, so! They laugh that win!"
    m:
      - "So, so, so, so! The winner’s always got the last laugh, hasn’t he?"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Why the cry goes that you shall marry her."
    m:
      - "I swear, there’s a rumor going around that you’ll marry her."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Prithee say true!"
    m:
      - "You’re kidding!"

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "I am a very villain else."
    m:
      - "If it’s not true, you can call me a villain."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Have you scored me? Well."
    m:
      - "Have you given me bastard children to raise? All right, then."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "This is the monkey’s own giving out. She is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise."
    m:
      - "The little monkey must have started that rumor herself. She thinks I’ll marry her because she loves me. She’s just flattering herself. I never promised her anything."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Iago beckons me. Now he begins the story."
    m:
      - "Iago is gesturing for me to come closer. Now he’s telling the story."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "She was here even now. She haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck—"
    m:
      - "She was here just now. She hangs around me all the time. I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore, and the fool showed up. I swear to you, she put her arms around me like this—"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Crying “O dear Cassio!” as it were. His gesture imports it."
    m:
      - "Saying, “Oh, Cassio,” it seems, judging by his gestures."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me, so shakes, and pulls me! Ha, ha, ha!"
    m:
      - "She hangs around me and dangles from my neck and cries, shaking me and pulling at me. Ha, ha, ha!"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. Oh, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to."
    m:
      - "Now he’s saying how she took him into our bedroom. Oh, I can see your nose now. But I can’t see the dog I’m going to throw it to."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "Well, I must leave her company."
    m:
      - "I have to get rid of her."

  - sp: IAGO
    o:
      - "Before me! Look, where she comes."
    m:
      - "Look out, here she comes."

    ms: "BIANCA enters."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "’Tis such another fitchew. Marry, a perfumed one.—"
      - "What do you mean by this haunting of me?"
    m:
      - "It’s a whore like all the others, stinking of cheap perfume.—Why are you always hanging around me?"

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the work? A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there! This is some minx’s token, and I must take out the work? There, give it your hobby-horse. Wheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work on ’t."
    m:
      - "Damn you! What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief? I was an idiot to take it! You want me to copy the embroidery pattern? That was a likely story, that you found it in your room and didn’t know who it belonged to. This is a love token from some other slut, and you want me to copy its pattern for you? Give it back to her, I won’t do anything with it."

  - sp: CASSIO
    o:
      - "How now, my sweet Bianca! How now, how now?"
    m:
      - "What is it, my dear Bianca? What’s wrong?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!"
    m:
      - "My God, that’s my handkerchief!"

    m:
