<p>What would you more?—Pompey, good night. <em>(to ANTONY)</em> Good brother,</p>
<p>Let me request you off. Our graver business</p>
<p>Frowns at this levity.—Gentle lords, let’s part.</p>
<p>You see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb</p>
<p>Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue</p>
<p>Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost</p>
<p>Anticked us all. What needs more words? Good night.</p>

<p>How can you top that? Good night, Pompey. <em>(to ANTONY)</em> Dear brother-in-law, let’s leave together. This frivolity isn’t appropriate to the serious purpose that brought us here. Noble lords, let’s say good night. We’ve all gotten red in the face. Even the strong Enobarbus isn’t immune to the effects of wine, and I’m tongue-tied myself. This wild party has almost turned us all into clowns. What more need I say? Good night. Good Antony, shake my hand.</p>
