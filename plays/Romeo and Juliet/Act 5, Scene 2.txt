    o:
      - "This same should be the voice of Friar John."
      - "Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?"
      - "Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter."
    m:
      - "That sounds like the voice of Friar John. Welcome back from Mantua. What does Romeo say? Or, if he wrote down his thoughts, give me his letter."

  - sp: FRIAR JOHN
    o:
      - "Going to find a barefoot brother out,"
      - "One of our order, to associate me,"

      - "So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed."
    m:
      - "I went to find another poor friar from our order to accompany me. He was here in this city visiting the sick. When I found him, the town health officials suspected that we were both in a house that had been hit with the plague. They quarantined the house, sealed up the doors, and refused to let us out. I couldn’t go to Mantua because I was stuck there."

      - "Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,"
      - "So fearful were they of infection."
    m:
      - "I couldn’t send it. Here it is. *(he gives FRIAR LAWRENCE a letter)* I couldn’t get a messenger to bring it to you either because they were scared of spreading the infection."

  - sp: FRIAR LAWRENCE
    o:
      - "Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,"
      - "The letter was not nice but full of charge,"
      - "Of dear import, and the neglecting it"
      - "May do much danger. Friar John, go hence."
      - "Get me an iron crow and bring it straight"
      - "Unto my cell."
    m:
      - "Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood, the letter was not just a nice greeting. It was full of very important information. It’s very dangerous that it hasn’t been sent. Friar John, go and get me an iron crowbar. Bring it straight back to my cell."

      - "Poor living corse, closed in a dead man’s tomb!"
    m:
      - "Now I must go to the tomb alone. Within three hours Juliet will wake up. She’ll be very angry with me that Romeo doesn’t know what happened. But I’ll write again to Mantua, and I’ll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes. That poor living corpse. She’s shut inside a dead man’s tomb!"
