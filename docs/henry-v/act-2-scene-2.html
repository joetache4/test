<p>The mercy that was quick in us but late</p>
<p>By your own counsel is suppressed and killed.</p>
<p>You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy,</p>
<p>For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,</p>
<p>As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.</p>
<p>—See you, my princes and my noble peers,</p>
<p>These English monsters. My Lord of Cambridge here,</p>
<p>You know how apt our love was to accord</p>
<p>To furnish him with all appurtenants</p>
<p>Belonging to his honor, and this man</p>
<p>Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,</p>
<p>And sworn unto the practices of France,</p>
<p>To kill us here in Hampton; to the which</p>
<p>This knight, no less for bounty bound to us</p>
<p>Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn.—But Oh,</p>
<p>What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop, thou cruel,</p>
<p>Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature?</p>
<p>Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,</p>
<p>That knew’st the very bottom of my soul,</p>
<p>That almost mightst have coined me into gold,</p>
<p>Wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use—</p>
<p>May it be possible that foreign hire</p>
<p>Could out of thee extract one spark of evil</p>
<p>That might annoy my finger? ’Tis so strange</p>
<p>That, though the truth of it stands off as gross</p>
<p>As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.</p>
<p>Treason and murder ever kept together</p>
<p>As two yoke-devils sworn to either’s purpose,</p>
<p>Working so grossly in a natural cause</p>
<p>That admiration did not whoop at them.</p>
<p>But thou, ’gainst all proportion, didst bring in</p>
<p>Wonder to wait on treason and on murder,</p>
<p>And whatsoever cunning fiend it was</p>
<p>That wrought upon thee so preposterously</p>
<p>Hath got the voice in hell for excellence.</p>
<p>All other devils that suggest by treasons</p>
<p>Do botch and bungle up damnation</p>
<p>With patches, colors, and with forms being fetched</p>
<p>From glist’ring semblances of piety.</p>
<p>But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up,</p>
<p>Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,</p>
<p>Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.</p>
<p>If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus</p>
<p>Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,</p>
<p>He might return to vasty Tartar back</p>
<p>And tell the legions “I can never win</p>
<p>A soul so easy as that Englishman’s.”</p>
<p>Oh, how hast thou with jealousy infected</p>
<p>The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?</p>
<p>Why, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learnèd?</p>
<p>Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?</p>
<p>Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious?</p>
<p>Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,</p>
<p>Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,</p>
<p>Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,</p>
<p>Garnished and decked in modest complement,</p>
<p>Not working with the eye without the ear,</p>
<p>And but in purgèd judgment trusting neither?</p>
<p>Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem.</p>
<p>And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot</p>
<p>To mark the full-fraught man and best endued</p>
<p>With some suspicion. I will weep for thee,</p>
<p>For this revolt of thine methinks is like</p>
<p>Another fall of man.—Their faults are open.</p>
<p>Arrest them to the answer of the law,</p>
<p>And God acquit them of their practices.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>KING HENRY</b>
<p>The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice. For shame, don’t talk of mercy. Your own arguments turn against you, like dogs who bite their own masters.—Princes and noble peers, take a look at these English monsters. Cambridge here, you know how I favored him and treated him with every respect due his rank. He was bought for a few coins, entering easily into this conspiracy with the French, promising to kill me here in Southhampton. And this knight, whom I’ve treated as generously as I have Cambridge, also joined the plot. But, oh, what can I say to you, Lord Scroop? You cruel, ungrateful, savage, and inhuman creature! You who had access to all my thoughts, who knew me to the inmost part of my soul, who could have had any amount of gold from me if you’d needed it and only asked me: is it possible that a foreign power could find in you even enough evil to injure one of my fingers? Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white, I can scarcely believe it, it’s so past understanding. Treason and murder have always gone together, like two devils joined in a common purpose. That’s natural. But you, against all reason, added something new to the equation. You added the sheer improbability that you could do this. Whatever fiend it was that seduced you must win the prize for excellence in hell. All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive, put together from shreds and patches of righteousness. But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor. The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion, could return to hell and tell the devil’s legions, “I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman’s.” How you have poisoned my faith in people! Now I am suspicious of everyone. Are there men who appear dutiful? Why, so did you. Are there those who seem serious and knowledgeable? Why, so did you. Do they come from good families? Why, so did you. Do they seem religious? Why, so did you. Do they live in moderation, free from excessive emotion—stable rather than changing their minds constantly—tastefully dressed, not merely seeing but also listening, and trusting no impression without confirmation? That’s how sound a man you appeared. Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion. You have broken my heart. This treachery of yours is like the second Fall of man.—Their crimes are revealed. Arrest and punish them according to the law, and may God pardon them for what they would have done.</p>
