Oh, what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young. Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet, why are you still so beautiful? Should I believe that death is in love with you, and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress? I don’t like that idea, so I’ll stay with you. And I will never leave this tomb. Here, here I’ll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids. Oh, I’ll rest here forever. I’ll forget about all the bad luck that has troubled me. Eyes, look out for the last time!

<p>I will be brief, for my short date of breath</p>
<p>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</p>
<p>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,</p>
<p>And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.</p>
<p>I married them, and their stol’n marriage day</p>
<p>Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death</p>
<p>Banished the new-made bridegroom from the city—</p>
<p>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</p>
<p>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</p>
<p>Betrothed and would have married her perforce</p>
<p>To County Paris. Then comes she to me,</p>
<p>And with wild looks bid me devise some mean</p>
<p>To rid her from this second marriage,</p>
<p>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</p>
<p>Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,</p>
<p>A sleeping potion, which so took effect</p>
<p>As I intended, for it wrought on her</p>
<p>The form of death.</p>
<p>Meantime I writ to Romeo,</p>
<p>That he should hither come as this dire night,</p>
<p>To help to take her from her borrowed grave,</p>
<p>Being the time the potion’s force should cease.</p>
<p>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</p>
<p>Was stayed by accident, and yesternight</p>
<p>Returned my letter back. Then all alone</p>
<p>At the prefixèd hour of her waking</p>
<p>Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,</p>
<p>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell</p>
<p>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo,</p>
<p>But when I came, some minute ere the time</p>
<p>Of her awakening, here untimely lay</p>
<p>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</p>
<p>She wakes, and I entreated her come forth,</p>
<p>And bear this work of heaven with patience.</p>
<p>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,</p>
<p>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</p>
<p>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</p>
<p>All this I know, and to the marriage</p>
<p>Her Nurse is privy. And if aught in this</p>
<p>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</p>
<p>Be sacrificed some hour before his time</p>
<p>Unto the rigor of severest law.</p>

<b>FRIAR LAWRENCE</b>
<p>I will be brief because I’m not going to live long enough to tell a boring story. Romeo, who lies there dead, was the husband of that Juliet. And she, who lies there dead, was that Romeo’s faithful wife. I married them; their secret wedding day was the day Tybalt died. His untimely death caused the bridegroom to be banished from the city. Juliet was sad because Romeo was gone, not because of Tybalt’s death. To cure her sadness, you arranged a marriage for her with Count Paris. Then she came to me, and, looking wild, she asked me to devise a plan to get her out of this second marriage. She threatened to kill herself in my cell if I didn’t help her. So I gave her a sleeping potion that I had mixed with my special skills. It worked as planned. She seemed to everyone to be dead. In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off. But the man who carried my letter, Friar John, was held up by an accident. Last night he gave me the letter back. So I came here alone at the hour when she was supposed to wake up. I came to take her out of her family’s tomb, hoping to hide her in my cell until I could make contact with Romeo. But by the time I got here, just a few minutes before Juliet woke up, Paris and Romeo were already dead. She woke up, and I asked her to come out of the tomb with me and endure this tragedy with patience. But then a noise sent me running scared from the tomb. She was too desperate to come with me, and it seems that she killed herself. I know all of this. And her Nurse knows about the marriage too. If any part of this tragedy is my fault, let my old life be sacrificed and let me suffer the most severe punishment.</p>
