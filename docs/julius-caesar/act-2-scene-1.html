<b>BRUTUS</b>
<p>It must be by his death, and for my part</p>
<p>I know no personal cause to spurn at him</p>
<p>But for the general. He would be crowned.</p>
<p>How that might change his nature, there’s the question.</p>
<p>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder</p>
<p>And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,</p>
<p>And then I grant we put a sting in him</p>
<p>That at his will he may do danger with.</p>
<p>Th’ abuse of greatness is when it disjoins</p>
<p>Remorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar,</p>
<p>I have not known when his affections swayed</p>
<p>More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof</p>
<p>That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,</p>
<p>Whereto the climber upward turns his face.</p>
<p>But when he once attains the upmost round,</p>
<p>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</p>
<p>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</p>
<p>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</p>
<p>Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel</p>
<p>Will bear no color for the thing he is,</p>
<p>Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,</p>
<p>Would run to these and these extremities.</p>
<p>And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg—</p>
<p>Which, hatched, would as his kind grow mischievous—</p>
<p>And kill him in the shell.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>BRUTUS</b>
<p>The only way is to kill Caesar. I have no personal reason to strike at him—only the best interest of the people. He wants to be crowned. The question is, how would being king change him? Evil can come from good, just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days—which means we have to walk carefully. If we crown him, I have to admit we’d be giving him the power to do damage. Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion. To be honest, I’ve never known Caesar to let his emotions get the better of his reason. But everyone knows that an ambitious young man uses humility to advance himself, but when he reaches the top, he turns his back on his supporters and reaches for the skies while scorning those who helped him get where he is. Caesar might act like that. Therefore, in case he does, we must hold him back. And since our quarrel is with his future behavior, not what he does now, I must frame the argument like this: if his position is furthered, his character will fulfill these predictions. And therefore we should liken him to a serpent’s egg—once it has hatched, it becomes dangerous, like all serpents. Thus we must kill him while he’s still in the shell.</p>

My ancestors drove Tarquin from the streets of Rome when he was pronounced a king. “Speak, strike, fix it!” Is this asking me to speak and strike? Oh, Rome, I promise you, if you’re meant to receive justice, you’ll receive it by my hand!</p>

Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim. But if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave—and I think we do—then, countrymen, what else could we possibly need to spur us to action? What bond do we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what they’re going to do and won’t back down? And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying? Swearing is for priests, cowards, overly cautious men, feeble old people, and those long-suffering weaklings who welcome abuse. Only men whom you wouldn’t trust anyway would swear oaths, and for the worst reasons. Don’t spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath, when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastard’s blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made.</p>

<b>CASSIUS</b>
<p>Good point, Decius. I don’t think it would be wise to let Mark Antony, whom Caesar is so fond of, outlive Caesar. We’d find that he was a dangerous plotter. And as you know, his connections, if he put them to good use, might be enough to hurt us all. To prevent this, Mark Antony should die along with Caesar.</p>

<p>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,</p>
<p>To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,</p>

<p>Let us be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius.</p>
<p>We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,</p>
<p>And in the spirit of men there is no blood.</p>
<p>Oh, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit</p>
<p>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,</p>
<p>Caesar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends,</p>
<p>Let’s kill him boldly but not wrathfully.</p>
<p>Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</p>
<p>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.</p>
<p>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</p>

<b>BRUTUS</b>
<p>Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesar’s head and then hack at his arms and legs too, Caius Cassius—because Mark Antony is merely one of Caesar’s arms. It’ll look like we killed Caesar out of anger and Mark Antony out of envy. Let’s be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius. We’re all against what Caesar stands for, and there’s no blood in that. Oh, how I wish we could oppose Caesar’s spirit—his overblown ambition—and not hack up Caesar himself! But, unfortunately, Caesar has to bleed if we’re going to stop him. Noble friends, let’s kill him boldly but not with anger. Let’s carve him up like a dish fit for the gods, not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs. Let’s be angry only long enough to do the deed, and then let’s act like we’re disgusted by what we had to do. This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful. If we appear calm to the people, they’ll call us surgeons rather than murderers. As for Mark Antony—forget him. He’ll be as useless as Caesar’s arm after Caesar’s head is cut off.</p>

I asked you again, and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently. I still insisted on knowing what the matter was, but you wouldn’t answer me, instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone. So I left, afraid of further provoking anger that was already inflamed but still hoping this was merely moodiness, which everyone is affected by once in awhile. Your strange mood won’t let you eat or talk or sleep. If it had changed your outward appearance as much as it has affected you on the inside, I wouldn’t even be able to recognize you, Brutus.
