<b>FIRST MERCHANT</b>
<p>So, tell people that you’re from Epidamnum-otherwise all your goods will be confiscated. Just today, a merchant from Syracuse was arrested for coming here. He couldn’t afford the ransom, so by law, he’ll be put to death before the sun sets. Here’s the money you asked me to hold.</p>
