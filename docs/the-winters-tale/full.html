<p>The King of Sicily could never be anything but kind to the King of Bohemia. They were brought up together as children, and so they have a deep-rooted affection for one another that can only grow. Because of their adult responsibilities and their duties as kings, they have not been able to meet personally. Instead their meetings have taken place via royal deputies and through the exchange of presents, letters, and fond words. Through these means they’ve stayed in touch despite the great distance between them. May the heavens keep their friendship strong!</p>

<p><em>(aside)</em> That is too much! To take friendship too far is to make it a love affair. My heart is trembling and dancing, but not for joy. This hospitality may have an innocent face, and my wife’s generosity may in fact come from warmth, affection, and the fact that it makes her more attractive. Maybe. But to hold hands, as they are doing right now, and flirtatiously smile at each other as though into a mirror, all the while sighing as loud as a horn blast, that is not entertainment that pleases my heart, or my head. Mamillius, are you my son?</p>

Come, sir page, look at me with your sky blue eye. Sweet villain! Dearest! My flesh! Can your mother have? Could it be? Jealousy’s intensity strikes me through to my heart and makes things that are impossible seem possible. That jealousy speaks in dreams. How can this be? It collaborates with what’s unreal and corresponds to nothing in real life. Then it’s very believable that my jealousy may be real, and she’s gone beyond what’s permitted, and I would find out and grow insane, and my brow would harden into horns.</p>

Unless I’m mistaken, there have been cuckolds before. Even now, as I speak, there is many a man who may hold his wife by the arm without suspecting that she has been unfaithful in his absence, and his neighbor, call him Sir Smile, has been with the woman that belongs to him. There’s comfort in the fact that other men have had wives and those wives have been unfaithful, as mine has, against their will. If everyone whose wife strayed were to despair, a tenth of mankind would hang themselves. There’s no remedy for it, since it is a world full of lust, from east to west and north and south. There’s no barricade you can build around the womb, and one’s enemy will go in and out as he pleases. Thousands of us have the disease and don’t know it. What now, boy?</p>

Those are the expressions that slander uses—no, I’m wrong—that mercy uses, because slander only attacks someone who is virtuous. These shrugs and mutterings after you say, “She’s goodly” interrupt you before you can say, “She’s virtuous.” Listen to the man who has the most reason to be upset about it: she’s an adulteress.</p>

<p>It is yours. It looks so much like you, and for the worse, as the proverb puts it. See, my lords, how the baby has all the features of her father in miniature: the eyes, nose, lips, her father’s frown and forehead, the dimples on his chin and cheeks, his smile. They have the same hands, nails, fingers. And so good goddess Nature has made the baby just like the man who conceived her. If Nature has control over temperament, too, don’t let her have any jealousy, or she’ll suspect, as her father does, that her children are not her husband’s!</p>

<b>HERMIONE</b>
<p>Since what I’m going to say must contradict this accusation and the only testimony in my favor comes from me, it hardly helps to say “not guilty.” I’m believed to be a liar, so whatever I say will be considered false. But if the gods watch what we humans do, I don’t doubt that innocence will win out against false accusation and tyranny. You, my lord, know that my past life has been faithful, pure, and true, though you seem to know this least of anyone. Those qualities are now matched by my unhappiness, which is greater than history has ever seen, even if it were created and performed to enthrall an audience. Look at me, who has slept in the royal bed, who owns part of the throne as the daughter of a great king, the mother of the prince who will one day take the throne, forced to defend my life and my honor in front of anyone who cares to come and hear. I care as much for life as I do for grief, which I could do without. Honor, though, is passed down from me to my children, so I will make a stand for that. I appeal to your conscience to remember how you held me in good graces before Polixenes came to court, and how I deserved to be regarded so. Since he came to court, think of what was so unacceptable about my behavior that I now appear on trial. If I have acted in any way dishonorably, or even seemed inclined to do so, may all that hear me harden their hearts, and may even my closest relatives curse my grave!</p>

<p>I take full ownership of my faults, but I won’t acknowledge any faults that aren’t mine. I confess that I loved Polixenes in the manner his honor required, and with a love that was befitting a lady like me—with such a love, even, as you yourself commanded. If I hadn’t love him in this way, I would have been disobeying you and showing ingratitude to both you and your friend, who has loved you since childhood. Now, as for conspiracy, I don’t even know what it is like, even if it is being aimed at me.

My third comfort, that unlucky child with the innocent milk still in its innocent mouth, has been taken from my breast and dragged out to be murdered. I’ve been publicly declared a whore, with outrageous hatred denied the rest after childbirth that all women of my rank deserve, and hurried here into the open air before I’ve regained my strength. Now, my lord, tell me what I have to live for, and why I should fear death. Go ahead. But listen to what I say, which I say not for the sake of my life but for my honor: if I am condemned on mere guesses and your jealousy without any proof, it is merely severity and not justice. Your honors, I commend myself to the oracle, and let Apollo be my judge!</p>

What old or new torture must I receive, since my every word deserves the worst you could give me? Think of what your jealousy—which is too silly even for boys, and too immature and foolish for a nine-year-old girl—together with your tyranny has done, and then you’ll go mad! All of your earlier insanities were just a foretaste of this. Your betrayal of Polixenes was nothing—it just showed you to be a fickle and ungrateful fool. Neither was it much that you tried to tarnish Camillo’s honor by commissioning him to assassinate a king. These are just small misdeeds, with a more monstrous one waiting. I suppose the fact that you threw your baby daughter to the crows is little or nothing beside this, even though a devil would have shed tears from his fiery eyes before he did that. And the death of the young prince isn’t directly your fault. His heart tore in two at the thought that his gracious mother had been so disgraced by his vulgar and foolish father. This is not the worst act you’ll have to answer for. But this last deed—Oh, lords, when I have told you to grieve, it is because the queen, that dearest, sweetest creature, is dead, and she has not yet been avenged.</p>

<p>Come, poor babe:</p>
<p>I have heard, but not believed,</p>
<p>the spirits o’ the dead</p>
<p>May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother</p>
<p>Appear’d to me last night, for ne’er was dream</p>
<p>So like a waking. To me comes a creature,</p>
<p>Sometimes her head on one side, some another;</p>
<p>I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,</p>
<p>So fill’d and so becoming: in pure white robes,</p>
<p>Like very sanctity, she did approach</p>
<p>My cabin where I lay; thrice bow’d before me,</p>
<p>And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes</p>
<p>Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon</p>
<p>Did this break-from her: “Good Antigonus,</p>
<p>Since fate, against thy better disposition,</p>
<p>Hath made thy person for the thrower-out</p>
<p>Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,</p>
<p>Places remote enough are in Bohemia,</p>

<p>I prithee, call’t. For this ungentle business</p>
<p>Put on thee by my lord, thou ne’er shalt see</p>
<p>Thy wife Paulina more.” And so, with shrieks</p>
<p>She melted into air. Affrighted much,</p>
<p>I did in time collect myself and thought</p>
<p>This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:</p>
<p>Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,</p>
<p>I will be squared by this. I do believe</p>
<p>Hermione hath suffer’d death, and that</p>
<p>Apollo would, this being indeed the issue</p>
<p>Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,</p>
<p>Either for life or death, upon the earth</p>
<p>Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!</p>
<p>There lie, and there thy character: there these;</p>
<p>Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,</p>
<p>And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,</p>
<p>That for thy mother’s fault art thus exposed</p>
<p>To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,</p>
<p>But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I</p>
<p>To be by oath enjoin’d to this. Farewell!</p>
<p>The day frowns more and more: thou’rt like to have</p>
<p>A lullaby too rough: I never saw</p>
<p>The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!</p>
<p>Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:</p>
<p>I am gone for ever.</p>

<b>ANTIGONUS</b>
<p>Come, poor child. I’ve heard but never believed that the spirits of the dead might walk the earth. But perhaps it is true, because last night your mother appeared to me, and no dream ever seemed so real. She comes to me with her head to one side or the other, and I’ve never seen anyone so filled with sorrow and so beautiful. Dressed in pure white robes, she came to my room where I was resting. She bowed three times to me, and struggling to speak, she broke into tears. Once her fury was spent, these words came out: “Good Antigonus, since fate, against your good nature, has chosen you to cast out my child according to your oath, leave her in the remote places of Bohemia. There you weep, and leave the child crying. Since she is lost forever, I ask you to call her Perdita. Because of this terrible business forced upon you, you will never see your wife Paulina again.” And then she disappeared, shrieking. Very frightened, I finally got myself together and decided it had truly happened and wasn’t a dream. Dreams are just trifles, but for this once, even if it’s superstition, I’ll be ruled by one. I believe that Hermione has died, and that this child is truly the child of King Polixenes, so Apollo would want her to be left, whether to life or death, on the land of her real father. Blossom, fare you well! <em>(he lays down the child and a scroll)</em> Lie there, and I’ll put an account of your parentage with you. <em>(he puts down a box)</em> These jewels and gold will help pay for your upbringing, and if fortune pleases, leave some left over for you. * (thunder)* The storm is beginning. Poor child, because of your mother’s transgressions you are left out to die! I can’t weep, but my heart bleeds, and I’m cursed for having to do this deed. Farewell! The day gets worse and worse. You are likely to be lulled to sleep with a rough lullaby. I’ve never seen the sky look so dark during the day. What a savage noise! I’ll be lucky to get on board! This is the hunt! I’m gone forever.</p>

Here is the product of some forbidden affair. I’m not a scholar, but I can read the signs of a lady-in-waiting behind this.

Don’t see it as a crime that I pass quickly over sixteen years and leave that wide gap unexamined, as I have the power to overthrow the laws of nature and, in one hour, to establish or topple custom. Let me remain as I’ve been since before civilization began through what currently is. I saw the times that led to the present, and as I did to the past, I’ll make the youngest things old and dim the shine of the present until it, too, is old. If your patience allows, I’ll turn my hourglass and move the scene forward as if you had slept through it all. Leontes mourns the terrible results of his foolish jealousy so much that he shuts himself away. Then imagine, dear spectators, that I am now in fair Bohemia, where a son of the king, named Florizel, lives. And quickly I’ll speak of Perdita, grown into a young woman so graceful she inspires admiration. I won’t prophecy what will happen to her, but let Time reveal it. She is a shepherd’s daughter, and what pertains to her is the provenance of Time. Allow this leap in time if ever before now you’ve spent time in a worse way.

<p>When daffodils begin to peer,</p>
<p>With heigh! the doxy over the dale,</p>
<p>Why, then comes in the sweet o’ the year;</p>
<p>For the red blood reigns in the winter’s pale.</p>
<p>The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,</p>
<p>With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!</p>
<p>Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;</p>
<p>For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.</p>
<p>The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,</p>
<p>With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,</p>
<p>Are summer songs for me and my aunts,</p>
<p>While we lie tumbling in the hay.</p>
<p>I have served Prince Florizel and in my time</p>
<p>wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:</p>
<p>But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?</p>
<p>The pale moon shines by night:</p>
<p>And when I wander here and there,</p>
<p>I then do most go right.</p>
<p>If tinkers may have leave to live,</p>
<p>And bear the sow-skin budget,</p>
<p>Then my account I well may, give,</p>
<p>And in the stocks avouch it.</p>
<p>My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to</p>
<p>lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who</p>
<p>being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise</p>
<p>a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and</p>
<p>drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is</p>
<p>the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful</p>

<b>AUTOLYCUS</b>
<p>When daffodils begin to sprout, with the poor wench over the hills, why then it’s the sweetest part of the year as red blood reigns in flesh made pale by winter. The white sheet airing out on the hedge, and oh, the sweet birds singing, makes my thieving fingers itch, and a quart of beer is a drink for a king! The lark chants “tirra-lyra,” and the thrush and the jay sing, while my mistress and I tumble about in the hay. I have served Prince Florizel and worn three-piled velvet, but now I’m unemployed. But should I mourn for that, my dear? The pale moon shines at night, and in wandering here and there, I take the right course through life. If menders of metal pots have the right to live and bear the burden of their tool bag, then I can tell my own story and in the stocks. I deal in sheets, and when the thieving bird builds his nest, he takes up poorer linen. My father named me Autolycus. Like me he was born under Mercury, and like me he would steal those little things left unsecured. By gambling and pimping I bought this outfit, and my income is from little deceptions. Being a highwayman might get me hanged or beat, which are terrors to me, and as for the afterlife, I try not to think about it. Oh, look—a prize!</p>

<p>Dearest Perdita, don’t let these farfetched thoughts dampen the high-spirits of the feast. I’ll be yours, my fair love, and not my father’s. I can’t be myself, or anything to anyone, if I’m not yours. My feelings won’t change, even if destiny says we are not to be together. Be happy, dearest.

<p>It’s a much more promising way of doing things than simply throwing yourself on unmarked waters and strange shores, which will certainly lead you to plenty of misery. There would be no hope to help you aside from casting off one shore to find another. Your anchors would be your only certainty, and the best they can do is hold you in a place you’ll be loath to remain. Besides, you know that good fortune keeps love strong, and that affliction will change the freshness of your affection and the feelings of your heart.</p>

<p>Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his</p>

<p>ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,</p>
<p>knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,</p>

<p>picture; and what I saw, to my good use I</p>
<p>remembered. My clown, who wants but something to</p>
<p>be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the</p>
<p>wenches’ song, that he would not stir his pettitoes</p>
<p>till he had both tune and words; which so drew the</p>

<p>stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it</p>
<p>was senseless; ’twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a</p>

<p>chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir’s song,</p>
<p>and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this</p>
<p>time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their</p>
<p>festival purses; and had not the old man come in</p>

<p>Ha ha! Honesty is such a fool, and Trust, his brother, is so naïve! I have sold all my goods—not a fake stone, or a ribbon, glass, brooch, book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoelace, bracelet, or ring made of horn remains in my pack. They crowded around me to see who could buy first, as if my trinkets were blessed and brought grace to the buyer. It let me know who had the fullest purse, and what I saw I remembered to put to use later. The yokel, who lacks just one quality to be a reasonable man, loved the girls’ song so much that he wouldn’t leave until he had bought both the tune and the words. And all the others were so entranced that it was as though all their other senses were committed to hearing. You could have stolen a skirt because no one could feel anything. It was easy to strip a purse from a codpiece, and I could have used a file to take keys off a chain. There was no hearing or feeling anything except for that song, and admiration for it. So while they were spellbound I stole most of their purses, which were filled with money for the festival. If the old man hadn’t come in wailing about his daughter and the king’s son and scared my little birds from the feed, I would have taken purses from every one.</p>

<p>in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard</p>

<p>passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest</p>

<p>I could only hear bits and pieces of the conversation. But I could hear the king and Camillo speaking in tones of admiration. They looked at each other so intently and with such astonishment that it seemed as if their eyes might pop out. Even their inability to speak communicated something, and so did their gestures. They looked as if the world had been taken hostage, or destroyed. They were obviously amazed. But even the most astute observer would be unable to say if it was joy or sorrow they felt, though obviously a great deal of one or the other.</p>

<p>Then you’ve missed something indescribable. You would have seen one joy upon another. It was so emotional that they both wept.

Our king, overcome with joy at having found his daughter, cried out, “Oh, your mother, your mother,” as if that joy had become a loss. Then he asked Polixenes for forgiveness, then embraced his son-in-law, and then harassed his daughter with embraces. Then he thanks the old shepherd, who stands there weeping like a stone statue.
