<p>Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:</p>
<p>Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he</p>
<p>Hath widow’d and unchilded many a one,</p>
<p>Which to this hour bewail the injury,</p>
<p>Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.</p>

<p>My rage is gone, and I’m full of sorrow. Lift him up. Help, three of the best soldiers. I’ll be the fourth. Play the drum in a mournful beat. Lay down your steel spears. Even though he has killed the husbands and children of many people in this city and they’re still mourning their loss, we’ll give him a noble memorial. Help me.</p>
