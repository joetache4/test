<p>Ho, no, no, no, no. My meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition. He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men. There be land rats and water rats, water thieves and land thieves—I mean pirates—and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is notwithstanding sufficient.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>SHYLOCK</b>
<p>What? No, no, no, no. What I meant in saying he’s a good man is that he has enough money to guarantee the loan. But his investments are uncertain right now. He has one ship bound for Tripoli, another heading for the Indies. What’s more, people at the Rialto tell me he has a third ship in Mexico, and a fourth in England, as well as other business ventures throughout the world. But ships are just fragile boards, and sailors are just men. There are rats and thieves and pirates—not to mention storms, winds, and rocks. Anything could happen. But in spite of all this, the man is still wealthy enough. Three thousand ducats—I think I can let him guarantee your loan.</p>

If I can just get the upper hand of him once, I’ll satisfy my old grudge against him. He hates Jews. Even at the Rialto he’s always complaining about me and my negotiating and my hard-earned profits, which he calls “interest.” It would an insult to Jews everywhere to forgive that man!</p>

<p>No, not take interest—not as you would say</p>

<p>When Laban and himself were compromised</p>
<p>That all the eanlings which were streaked and pied</p>
<p>Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes, being rank,</p>
<p>In the end of autumn turnèd to the rams.</p>
<p>And when the work of generation was</p>
<p>Between these woolly breeders in the act,</p>
<p>The skillful shepherd peeled me certain wands.</p>
<p>And in the doing of the deed of kind</p>
<p>He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,</p>
<p>Who then conceiving did in eaning time</p>
<p>Fall parti-colored lambs—and those were Jacob’s.</p>
<p>This was a way to thrive, and he was blessed.</p>
<p>And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>SHYLOCK</b>
<p>No, he didn’t charge interest—not in your sense of the word. But listen to what Jacob did. When he and Laban agreed that all the spotted lambs would be Jacob’s pay, it was the end of autumn, when the sheep were starting to mate. Because newborns look like whatever their mother sees during mating, he stuck some spotted branches into the ground right in front of the sheep, who saw them while they mated. The mothers later gave birth to spotted lambs, all of which went to Jacob. That was his way of expanding his business, and it worked. My point is that profit is a blessing, as long as you don’t steal to get it.</p>

<p>This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for—</p>

<p>That business venture you’re referring to happened because God made it happen like that. Jacob didn’t have any control over what happened. Are you saying this story proves that charging interest makes sense? That your interest payments are like Jacob’s sheep?</p>

<p>Signor Antonio, many a time and oft</p>
<p>In the Rialto you have rated me</p>

<p>For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.</p>
<p>You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog,</p>
<p>And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine—</p>
<p>And all for use of that which is mine own.</p>

<p>Go to, then! You come to me and you say,</p>
<p>“Shylock, we would have moneys.” You say so!—</p>
<p>You, that did void your rheum upon my beard</p>
<p>And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur</p>
<p>Over your threshold! Moneys is your suit.</p>
<p>What should I say to you? Should I not say,</p>
<p>“Hath a dog money? Is it possible</p>
<p>A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or</p>
<p>Shall I bend low and in a bondman’s key</p>
<p>With bated breath and whispering humbleness</p>
<p>Say this:</p>
<p>“Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;</p>
<p>You spurned me such a day; another time</p>
<p>You called me ’dog’—and for these courtesies</p>
<p>I’ll lend you thus much moneys?”</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>SHYLOCK</b>
<p>Signor Antonio, you’ve often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto. I have always just shrugged and put up with it because Jews are good at suffering. You called me a heathen, a dirty dog, and you spit on my Jewish clothes. And all because I use my own money to make a profit. And now it looks like you need my help. All right then. You come to me saying, “Shylock, we need money.” You say that!—even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you’d kick a stray mutt out your front door. And now you’re asking for money. What can I tell you? Shouldn’t I say, “Does a dog have money? Is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats?” Or should I bend down low, and in a humble and submissive voice say: “Sir, last Wednesday you spit on me. You insulted me on this day, and another time you called me a dog. And out of gratitude for these favors, I’ll be happy to lend you the money?”</p>
