  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool."
      - "Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship"
      - "To banish him that struck more blows for Rome"
      - "Than thou hast spoken words?"
    m:
      - "You fool, are you trying to insult me? Listen, fool. Wasn’t my father a man? Are you so ungrateful that you’d banish the man who swung his sword for Rome more times than you’ve even opened your mouth to speak?"

  - sp: SICINIUS

      - "O blessed heavens!"

      - "His good sword in his hand."
    m:
      - "He fought nobly for Rome more times than you’ve ever spoken wise words. I’ll tell you what: go! No, stay actually. I wish my son were in the lawless deserts of Arabia, with his sword in hand, and your people stood before him."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "What then?"

      - "What would happen then?"

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "Bastards and all."
      - "Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!"
    m:
      - "Your bastard children’s, too. He’s a good man, and he was wounded fighting for Rome!"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Come, come, peace."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "I would he had continued to his country"
      - "As he began, and not unknit himself"
      - "The noble knot he made."
    m:
      - "I wish he had continued to honor his country the way he always did, rather than renounce his loyalty."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "I would he had."
    m:
      - "I wish he had."

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "“I would he had”! ’Twas you incensed the rabble:"
      - "Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth"
      - "As I can of those mysteries which heaven"
      - "Will not have earth to know."
    m:
      - "“I wish he had”! It was you who incensed the commoners. Those people are like cats and no more able to judge his character than I am able to know the unknowable mysteries of heaven."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Pray, let us go."
    m:
      - "Please, let’s go."

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "Now, pray, sir, get you gone:"
      - "You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:—"
      - "As far as doth the Capitol exceed"
      - "The meanest house in Rome, so far my son—"
      - "This lady’s husband here, this, do you see—"
      - "Whom you have banish’d, does exceed you all."
    m:
      - "Yes. Please, sir, do go away now. You’ve done enough. But before you go, hear this: as much as the capitol building stands taller than the lowest house in Rome, that’s how much my son, her husband, the man you banished, exceeds all of you."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Well, well, we’ll leave you."
    m:
      - "That’s enough. We’re leaving now."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Why stay we to be baited"
      - "With one that wants her wits?"
    m:
      - "Why would we stay to be harassed by someone who is so out of her mind?"

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "Take my prayers with you."
    m:
      - "Take my prayers with you."

  - os: "Exeunt Tribunes"

  - o:
      - "I would the gods had nothing else to do"
      - "But to confirm my curses! Could I meet ’em"
      - "But once a-day, it would unclog my heart"
      - "Of what lies heavy to’t."
    m:
      - "I wish the gods had nothing else to do but carry out my curses! If I could just meet with them once a day, it would unclog the heavy weight from my heart."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "You have told them home;"
      - "And, by my troth, you have cause. You’ll sup with me?"
    m:
      - "You’ve driven them away, and rightly so, I believe. Will you eat with me?"

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:
      - "Anger’s my meat; I sup upon myself,"
      - "And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let’s go:"
      - "Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,"
      - "In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come."
    m:
      - "I’ll eat alone. Anger is my meat, but indulging my anger will also be the death of me. Come, let’s go. Do as I do: stop whining and being sad. Despite being angry, let’s behave like Juno. Come, come, come."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Fie, fie, fie!"
    m:
      - "No, no, no!"

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "All exit."
