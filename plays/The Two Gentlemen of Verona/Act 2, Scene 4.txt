  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Haply I do."
    m:
      - "As it happens, I seem to be something I’m not."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "So do counterfeits."
    m:
      - "Just like a fake."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "So do you."
    m:
      - "You also seem to be something you’re not."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "What seem I that I am not?"
    m:
      - "What do I seem like that I am not?"

  - sp: VALENTINE

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "What instance of the contrary?"
    m:
      - "What proof do you have to the contrary?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Your folly."
    m:
      - "Your foolishness."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "And how quote you my folly?"
    m:
      - "And what do you know of my foolishness?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "I quote it in your jerkin."
    m:
      - "Because you’re wearing a jerkin."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "My “jerkin” is a doublet."
    m:
      - "My “jerkin” is actually a doublet."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Well, then, I’ll double your folly."
    m:
      - "Well, then, you’re doubly foolish."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "How?"
    m:
      - "Why?"

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "What, angry, Sir Thurio? Do you change color?"
    m:
      - "What, are you angry, Sir Thurio? Is your face turning red?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon."
    m:
      - "Leave him be, madame. He’s just a kind of chameleon."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air."
    m:
      - "One that would rather feed off your blood, Valentine, than its usual diet of air."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "You have said, sir."
    m:
      - "So you say, sir."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "Ay, sir, and done too, for this time."
    m:
      - "Yes, sir, and it’ll be done, too."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin."
    m:
      - "I know it’s done, sir. You always end before you begin."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off."
    m:
      - "A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly fired."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "’Tis indeed, madam, we thank the giver."
    m:
      - "It is indeed, madame. We have the giver to thank for that."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "Who is that, servant?"
    m:
      - "And who is the giver, servant?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Yourself, sweet lady, for you gave the fire. Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship’s looks, and spends what he borrows kindly in your company."
    m:
      - "Yourself, sweet lady, for you provided the spark that set it off. Sir Thurio gets his witty remarks from your ladyship’s good looks, and appropriately he spends what he borrows in your presence."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall make your wit bankrupt."
    m:
      - "Sir, if you spar word for word with me, I shall make your wit dry up."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words, and, I think, no other treasure to give your followers, for it appears, by their bare liveries, that they live by your bare words."
    m:
      - "I know it well, sir. You have a whole treasury of words, and, I think, no other treasure to give your servants, since it appears, by their ragged clothing, that they live by your worthless words alone."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "No more, gentlemen, no more. Here comes my father."
    m:
      - "No more, gentlemen, no more. Here comes my father."

  - os: "Enter the DUKE"
    ms: "The DUKE enters."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Now, daughter Sylvia, you are hard beset."
      - "Sir Valentine, your father is in good health."
      - "What say you to a letter from your friends"
      - "Of much good news?"
    m:
      - "Now, my daughter Sylvia, you are being assaulted. Sir Valentine, your father is healthy. What would you say to a letter from your friends filled with good news?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "My lord, I will be thankful"
      - "To any happy messenger from thence."
    m:
      - "My lord, I would be thankful to anyone who brought good news from home."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?"
    m:
      - "Do you know Don Antonio, who is also from your country?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman"
      - "To be of worth and worthy estimation,"
      - "And not without desert so well reputed."
    m:
      - "Yes, my good lord. I know the gentleman is noble and has a good reputation, which is well-deserved."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Hath he not a son?"
    m:
      - "Doesn’t he have a son?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Ay, my good lord, a son that well deserves"
      - "The honor and regard of such a father."
    m:
      - "Yes, my good lord, a son that is also deserving of the honor and reputation of his esteemed father."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "You know him well?"
    m:
      - "Do you know him well?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "I knew him as myself, for from our infancy"
      - "We have conversed and spent our hours together."
      - "And though myself have been an idle truant,"
      - "Omitting the sweet benefit of time"
      - "To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,"
      - "Yet hath Sir Proteus—for that’s his name—"
      - "Made use and fair advantage of his days;"
      - "His years but young, but his experience old;"
      - "His head unmellowed, but his judgment ripe."
      - "And, in a word—for far behind his worth"
      - "Comes all the praises that I now bestow—"
      - "He is complete in feature and in mind"
      - "With all good grace to grace a gentleman."
    m:
      - "I know him as well as I know myself, since he and I have been in each other’s company and spent time together since we were infants. And even though I myself have been an unproductive delinquent and have wasted my youth on frivolity, Sir Proteus—that’s his name, you see—made good use of his time. He may be young, but he has the experience of a much older person. His hair isn’t gray, but his judgment is wise. Any praise I give is far less than he deserves, but in a word, he is perfect physically and mentally, with all the good graces of a true gentleman."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,"
      - "He is as worthy for an empress’ love"
      - "As meet to be an emperor’s counselor."
      - "Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,"
      - "With commendation from great potentates,"
      - "And here he means to spend his time awhile."
      - "I think ’tis no unwelcome news to you."
    m:
      - "Damn! Sir, if this account is true, he is as worthy of an empress’ love as he is fit to be an emperor’s adviser. Well, sir, this gentleman has come to me with commendations from powerful men, and he intends to spend his time here for a while. I think it’s good news for you."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Should I have wished a thing, it had been he."
    m:
      - "If I had wished for anything, it would have been for him to come."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Welcome him then according to his worth."
      - "Sylvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;"
      - "For Valentine, I need not cite him to it."
      - "I will send him hither to you presently."
    m:
      - "Then give him the welcome he deserves. I’m speaking to you, Sylvia, and you, Sir Thurio. Valentine needs no urging. I will send him to you here shortly."

  - os: "Exit the DUKE"
    ms: "The DUKE exits."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "This is the gentleman I told your ladyship"
      - "Had come along with me but that his mistress"
      - "Did hold his eyes locked in her crystal looks."
    m:
      - "This is the gentlemen I told your ladyship would have come along with me had the woman he loved not captivated him with her beauty."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "Belike that now she hath enfranchised them"
      - "Upon some other pawn for fealty."
    m:
      - "Perhaps now she’s freed him because some other lover has pledged devotion to her."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still."
    m:
      - "No, I’m sure she still holds him prisoner."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "Nay, then he should be blind, and being blind"
      - "How could he see his way to seek out you?"
    m:
      - "No, if that were true, then he would be blind, and if he were blind, how could he see to find his way to you?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes."
    m:
      - "Why, lady, Love has twenty pairs of eyes."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "They say that Love hath not an eye at all."
    m:
      - "They say that Love is blind and has no eyes at all."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself."
      - "Upon a homely object Love can wink."
    m:
      - "Love has no eyes for people like you, Thurio. Love can shut its eyes to ugly things."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "Have done, have done. Here comes the gentleman."
    m:
      - "Stop, stop. Here comes the gentleman."

  - os: "Enter PROTEUS"
    ms: "PROTEUS enters."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Welcome, dear Proteus!—Mistress, I beseech you,"
      - "Confirm his welcome with some special favor."
    m:
      - "Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beg you, make him feel welcome by giving him some sign of your affection."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,"
      - "If this be he you oft have wished to hear from."
    m:
      - "His worthiness is enough for us to welcome here if he’s the one you’ve often wished to hear from."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Mistress, it is. Sweet lady, entertain him"
      - "To be my fellow servant to your ladyship."
    m:
      - "Mistress, it is he. Sweet lady, take him into your service to be my fellow servant to your ladyship."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "Too low a mistress for so high a servant."
    m:
      - "I’m too unworthy a mistress for so noble a servant."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Not so, sweet lady, but too mean a servant"
      - "To have a look of such a worthy mistress."
    m:
      - "Not so, sweet lady. I’m too unworthy a servant to have caught a look from a worthy mistress."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Leave off discourse of disability."
      - "Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant."
    m:
      - "Don’t talk about unworthiness. Sweet lady, ask him to be your servant."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "My duty will I boast of, nothing else."
    m:
      - "I’ll only boast of my duty, nothing else."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "And duty never yet did want his meed."
      - "Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress."
    m:
      - "And duty never did go unrewarded. Servant, I, a worthless mistress, welcome you."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "I’ll die on him that says so but yourself."
    m:
      - "I’ll die fighting anyone who says that but you."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "That you are welcome?"
    m:
      - "That you are welcome?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "That you are worthless."
    m:
      - "That you are worthless."

  - os: "Enter a Servant"
    ms: "A Servant enters."

  - sp: SERVANT
    o:
      - "Madam, my lord your father would speak with you."
    m:
      - "Madame, my lord—your father—would like to speak with you."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "I wait upon his pleasure."
    m:
      - "I’ll be there in a moment."

  - os: "Exit Servant"
    ms: "The Servant exits."

  - o:
      - "Come, Sir Thurio,"
      - "Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome."
      - "I’ll leave you to confer of home affairs."
      - "When you have done we look to hear from you."
    m:
      - "Come, Sir Thurio, go with me. Again, I welcome you, new servant. I’ll leave you to talk with your friend about affairs back home. We look forward to seeing you when you’re finished."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "We’ll both attend upon your ladyship."
    m:
      - "We’ll both be back to serve you shortly, your ladyship."

  - os: "Exeunt SYLVIA and THURIO"
    ms: "SYLVIA and THURIO exit."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Now tell me, how do all from whence you came?"
    m:
      - "Now tell me, how is everyone back home?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Your friends are well and have them much commended."
    m:
      - "Your friends are well and send their regards."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "And how do yours?"
    m:
      - "And how are your friends?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "I left them all in health."
    m:
      - "They were all fine and healthy when I left."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "How does your lady, and how thrives your love?"
    m:
      - "How is your lady, and is your love thriving?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "My tales of love were wont to weary you;"
      - "I know you joy not in a love discourse."
    m:
      - "My tales of love used to bore you. I know you don’t enjoy talking about love."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Ay, Proteus, but that life is altered now."
      - "I have done penance for contemning Love,"
      - "Whose high imperious thoughts have punished me"
      - "With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,"
      - "With nightly tears, and daily heartsore sighs;"
      - "For, in revenge of my contempt of love,"
      - "Love hath chased sleep from my enthrallèd eyes"
      - "And made them watchers of mine own heart’s sorrow."
      - "O gentle Proteus, Love’s a mighty lord,"
      - "And hath so humbled me as I confess"
      - "There is no woe to his correction,"
      - "Nor to his service no such joy on earth."
      - "Now, no discourse, except it be of love;"
      - "Now can I break my fast, dine, sup, and sleep"
      - "Upon the very naked name of love."
    m:
      - "Yes, Proteus, but my life is different now. I have atoned for condemning Love. Overbearing thoughts of love punish me with bitter periods of not eating, remorseful groans, nightly tears, and daily lovesick sighs. In revenge for my contempt, Love keeps me awake and makes my eyes watch the woman responsible for my heart’s sorrow. Oh, kind Proteus, Love’s a powerful ruler and has so humbled me that I confess there is no sorrow as bad as his punishment and no joy equal to being in love. Now, speak no more unless it’s about love. Now I can eat again, have lunch and dinner, and sleep thinking of love."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Enough. I read your fortune in your eye."
      - "Was this the idol that you worship so?"
    m:
      - "Enough. I knew how you felt from the look in your eyes. Was that the woman you worship like an idol?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Even she. And is she not a heavenly saint?"
    m:
      - "That was she. Isn’t she a heavenly saint?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "No, but she is an earthly paragon."
    m:
      - "No, but she is a model of beauty here on earth."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Call her divine."
    m:
      - "Call her a goddess."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "I will not flatter her."
    m:
      - "I will not fawn over her."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "O, flatter me, for love delights in praises."
    m:
      - "Oh, flatter me, then, because those who are in love delight in praise."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,"
      - "And I must minister the like to you."
    m:
      - "When I was lovesick, you gave me the hard truth, and now I must give it to you."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,"
      - "Yet let her be a principality,"
      - "Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth."
    m:
      - "Then speak the truth about her. If she isn’t a goddess, then call her an angel who is superior to all the creatures on earth."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Except my mistress."
    m:
      - "Except my mistress."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Sweet, except not any,"
      - "Except thou wilt except against my love."
    m:
      - "No exceptions, my friend, unless you mean to insult my love."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Have I not reason to prefer mine own?"
    m:
      - "Don’t I have reason to put forward my own girl?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "And I will help thee to prefer her, too."
      - "She shall be dignified with this high honor:"
      - "To bear my lady’s train, lest the base earth"
      - "Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss"
      - "And, of so great a favor growing proud,"
      - "Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower"
      - "And make rough winter everlastingly."
    m:
      - "And I will help you to put her forward, too. She shall have the dignity of having this high honor: she can carry the train of my lady’s dress so that the dirty ground can’t steal a kiss of her clothing. If it did, the ground would swell so much with pride that it would no longer accept the roots of the summer flowers, and rough winter would last forever."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Why, Valentine, what braggartism is this?"
    m:
      - "Geez, Valentine, why are you bragging so much?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Pardon me, Proteus, all I can is nothing"
      - "To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing."
      - "She is alone."
    m:
      - "Pardon me, Proteus, any praise I can give is nothing in comparison with her. She is unique and alone among women."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Then, let her alone."
    m:
      - "Then leave her alone."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Not for the world. Why, man, she is mine own,"
      - "And I as rich in having such a jewel"
      - "As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,"
      - "The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold."
      - "Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,"
      - "Because thou seest me dote upon my love."
      - "My foolish rival, that her father likes"
      - "Only for his possessions are so huge,"
      - "Is gone with her along, and I must after,"
      - "For love, thou know’st, is full of jealousy."
    m:
      - "Not for the world. Why, man, she is mine, and having a jewel such as her, I’m as rich as if I had twenty oceans with sands made of pearls, water of nectar, and rocks of pure gold. Forgive me for not paying attention to you, because I’m doting on the woman I love, as you can tell. Her father likes my foolish rival, Thurio, because he has so much wealth. Thurio has gone with her, and I must follow after them, because love, as you know, is prone to jealousy."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "But she loves you?"

    o:
      - "Ay, and we are betrothed. Nay, more, our marriage-hour,"
      - "With all the cunning manner of our flight,"
      - "Determined of—how I must climb her window,"
      - "The ladder made of cords, and all the means"
      - "Plotted and ’greed on for my happiness."
      - "Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,"
      - "In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel."
    m:
      - "Yes, and we’re engaged to be married. No, what’s more, we’ve determined all the details of how we’ll sneak away and elope—how I must climb up to her window on a ladder made of rope. Everything is arranged and agreed upon for my happiness. Good Proteus, go with me to my bedroom to give me some advice on these matters."

    o:
      - "Go on before; I shall enquire you forth."
      - "I must unto the road, to disembark"
      - "Some necessaries that I needs must use,"
      - "And then I’ll presently attend you."
    m:
      - "Go on ahead. I’ll find you shortly. I must go down to the harbor to bring ashore some necessities that I need. Then I’ll come see you right away."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "I will."
      - "Even as one heat another heat expels,"
      - "Or as one nail by strength drives out another,"
      - "So the remembrance of my former love"
      - "Is by a newer object quite forgotten."
      - "Is it my mind, or Valentine’s praise,"
      - "Her true perfection, or my false transgression"
      - "That makes me, reasonless, to reason thus?"
      - "She is fair; and so is Julia that I love—"
      - "That I did love, for now my love is thawed,"
      - "Which like a waxen image ’gainst a fire"
      - "Bears no impression of the thing it was."
      - "Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,"
      - "And that I love him not as I was wont."
      - "O, but I love his lady too, too much,"
      - "And that’s the reason I love him so little."
      - "How shall I dote on her with more advice,"
      - "That thus without advice begin to love her!"
      - "’Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,"
      - "And that hath dazzlèd my reason’s light;"
      - "But when I look on her perfections,"
      - "There is no reason but I shall be blind."
      - "If I can check my erring love, I will;"
      - "If not, to compass her I’ll use my skill."
    m:
      - "I will. Just as one heat can extinguish another, or as one nail can drive another out with force, so too has a new love, Sylvia, driven out the memory of my former love, Julia. Is it my own attraction for her, or Valentine’s praise, or her own perfection, or going against my love for Julia that makes me feel this way? She is beautiful, but so is Julia, whom I love—whom I did love, because now my love for her has melted away, like a wax figure melted by a fire that no longer looks as it did. I think that my fondness for Valentine has diminished, too, and that I like him less than I used to. Oh, but I love his lady, Syliva, far too much, and that’s why I like him less now. How can I keep from loving her after further deliberation when I begin to love her with no deliberation at all! It’s only her surface I’ve seen so far, and that has already confused my sense of reason. But when I look at her perfection, there is no doubt I will be blind with love. If I can stop my love, I will. If not, I’ll use my skill to win her."
