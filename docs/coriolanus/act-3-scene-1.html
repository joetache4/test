<p>That ne’er did service for’t: being press’d to the war,</p>
<p>Even when the navel of the state was touch’d,</p>
<p>They would not thread the gates. This kind of service</p>
<p>Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i’ the war</p>
<p>Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show’d</p>
<p>Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation</p>
<p>Which they have often made against the senate,</p>

<p>What’s like to be their words: “we did request it;</p>
<p>We are the greater poll, and in true fear</p>
<p>They gave us our demands.” Thus we debase</p>
<p>The nature of our seats and make the rabble</p>

</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>CORIOLANUS</b>
<p>I’ll give my reasons, which are worthier than their wishes. They know they didn’t earn the corn, as they certainly never did any service for it. Even when they were drafted to fight the war when the center of the state was threatened, they wouldn’t leave the city gates. This kind of service doesn’t deserve free corn. When they were in the war, their mutinies and revolts, which were the only times they showed any courage, didn’t speak well for them. Their frequent accusation that the Senate was hoarding corn had no basis, so it could never be the reason for our generous gift. Well, what then? How will this many-headed monster repay the Senate’s kindness? Let their actions express what their words should be: “We asked for it, we are the majority of the population, and out of fear they gave in to our demands.” In doing this we degrade the nature of our position and make the rabble think that our sympathy is fear. In time this will break open the locks of the Senate, and the scavengers will devour us.</p>

<b>CORIOLANUS</b>
<p>No, there’s more! I swear there’s both divine and human confirmation of what I have to say. A divided government—in which one part rightfully despises the other and the other part makes insulting accusations without any reason, and in which people of class, title, and wisdom are reduced to deciding things just by voting yes or no—will be unable to focus on important matters and so instead will deal only with trivial concerns. When governing becomes so difficult, it makes sense that nothing will get done well. So I beg you, you who won’t be afraid to take action because you care more about preserving our government than you fear the consequences of doing so, you who prefer a noble life over a long one and are willing to use a dangerous medicine to help someone who would otherwise surely die, you must immediately remove the representatives of the common people. Don’t let the tribunes use their poisonous flattery. When they dishonor you, it’s an impediment to justice. It robs the state of your much-needed integrity and leaves the state without the power to do the good it would because evil forces are controlling it.</p>
