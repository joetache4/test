He prays that your armies will prevail against the terrible power of the enemy.</p>

<p>The dove and very blessèd spirit of peace,</p>
<p>Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself</p>
<p>Out of the speech of peace, that bears such grace,</p>
<p>Into the harsh and boist’rous tongue of war,</p>

You, who are a holy man, and these good gentlemen as well—you would not be here, lending dignity to this bloody insurrection, if it appeared as rebellion normally does: like a lowborn mob, led by bloody youths uniformed in rags, and supported by boys and beggars. You, Lord Archbishop—whose diocese is peaceful and law-abiding; whose beard has turned white, signifying a peaceful life; whose education and learning are the products of peaceful times; who is the dove and very blessed embodiment of peace—why are you translating yourself from the graceful language of peace into the harsh, violent language of war? You’re turning your books into coffins, your ink into blood, your pens into swords, and your holy words into a trumpet that sounds a call to arms.</p>

<b>ARCHBISHOP</b>
<p>Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.</p>
<p>Briefly, to this end: we are all diseased,</p>
<p>And with our surfeiting and wanton hours</p>
<p>Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,</p>
<p>And we must bleed for it; of which disease</p>
<p>Our late King Richard, being infected, died.</p>
<p>But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,</p>
<p>I take not on me here as a physician,</p>
<p>Nor do I as an enemy to peace</p>
<p>Troop in the throngs of military men,</p>
<p>But rather show awhile like fearful war</p>
<p>To diet rank minds sick of happiness</p>
<p>And purge th’ obstructions which begin to stop</p>
<p>Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</p>
<p>I have in equal balance justly weighed</p>
<p>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</p>
<p>And find our griefs heavier than our offenses.</p>
<p>We see which way the stream of time doth run</p>
<p>And are enforced from our most quiet there</p>
<p>By the rough torrent of occasion,</p>
<p>And have the summary of all our griefs,</p>
<p>When time shall serve, to show in articles;</p>
<p>Which long ere this we offered to the King</p>
<p>And might by no suit gain our audience.</p>
<p>When we are wronged and would unfold our griefs,</p>
<p>We are denied access unto his person</p>
<p>Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</p>
<p>The dangers of the days but newly gone,</p>
<p>Whose memory is written on the earth</p>
<p>With yet appearing blood, and the examples</p>
<p>Of every minute’s instance, present now,</p>
<p>Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,</p>
<p>Not to break peace or any branch of it,</p>
<p>But to establish here a peace indeed,</p>
<p>Concurring both in name and quality.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ARCHBISHOP</b>
<p>Why am I doing this? That is the question. The short answer is this: we’re all sick. We’ve eaten and drunk too much and stayed up all night, and now we have a burning fever whose only cure is bloodletting. Richard, our late King, was infected with this disease and died from it. But, my good Lord Westmoreland, I’m not here as a physician, nor am I marching with this army as an enemy of peace. What I’m doing is making a frightening show of war, to stop people from indulging all their vices. This will clear the hardening of the arteries which threatens to kill us all. Let me speak more plainly. I’ve carefully considered the options, weighing the harm our armies are likely to cause against the harm we’re already suffering, and I find that our grievances are stronger than our offenses. We can see where things are headed, and the rough times ahead leave us with no choice but to step away from our quiet lives. We have a list of grievances which we can publish at the appropriate time. We offered that list to the King a long time ago, but we could never get an audience with him. We were wronged, and when we tried to speak to the King about it, we were denied access to him by the very men who had wronged us most. We’re in this seemingly unbefitting armor because of the terrible recent violence—the bloodshed from which is still visible on the ground—and because of the terrible things happening now, every minute. We don’t want to harm peace in any way. We want instead to establish a peace that’s real and meaningful.</p>

<p>Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,</p>

<p>My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,</p>
<p>O, when the King did throw his warder down—</p>
<p>His own life hung upon the staff he threw—</p>

<b>MOWBRAY</b>
<p>What did my father lose that I now need to restore? Richard, the King at the time, loved my father, but given what was happening he had no choice but to banish him. And then, at Coventry, my father and Harry Bolingbroke met in a formal challenge. They were both mounted on their horses and ready to charge. Their horses were neighing, anxiously waiting for their riders’ spurs to drive them forward. Their steel-tipped lances were ready for the attack. The visors of their helmets were down. Their eyes were on fire behind the steel slits. The trumpet sounded, and then—when there was nothing that could have stopped my father from killing Bolingbroke—the King prevented the fight by throwing down his royal scepter. That scepter was a symbol of his life; when he threw it down, he threw down his life and the lives of every man that has since died at war under the leadership of Bolingbroke.</p>

They blessed him and adored him even more than the King. But I digress. I was sent here by our general, the Prince, to hear your grievances, and to tell you that he’s prepared to listen to you.

<p>No, no, sir. Listen, the king is tired of getting upset over every little thing. He’s discovered that ending one problem by killing someone only creates two bigger problems in the people left alive. So from now on, he’ll wipe his memory clean, and forget anything that might remind him of the bad things from his past. He knows that he can’t just eliminate every single opponent who crops up. His enemies are rooted in with his friends, to the extent that, if he tries to pull up an enemy, he’ll also uproot and discard a friend. This country’s like a misbehaving wife, who, just when her husband is about to hit her, holds his baby up, and freezes the intended punishment in the very arm that was poised to apply it.</p>

<p>In shadow of such greatness! With you, Lord Bishop,</p>
<p>It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken</p>
<p>How deep you were within the books of God,</p>
<p>To us the speaker in His parliament,</p>
<p>To us th’ imagined voice of God himself,</p>

<p>I’m glad to see you, my cousin Mowbray. Good day to you, gentle Archbishop, and to you, Lord Hastings, and to all. Lord Archbishop, it was better to see you when worshippers—called together by the church bell—surrounded you to hear Biblical sermons than it is to see you here, in armor; cheering a mob of rebels with your war drums, turning your words to weapons, and your life into death. When a man is close to the King’s heart, and grows strong under the King’s protection, only to turn against him—alas! What evils that man will unleash, hidden from view by the King’s own reputation! This is exactly how it is with you, Lord Bishop. Who hasn’t heard how profound your religious knowledge is? To us, you were our representative in God’s own parliament. To us, you might as well have been God’s own voice: the interpreter and ambassador between God’s heavenly ways and our own dull, mortal actions. And now, who would say anything but that you are abusing the holiness of your position, using the outward show of godliness to do terrible things, like a treacherous courtier uses the King’s good name? You have pretended to be acting in God’s name as you encourage the subjects of God’s deputy, my father, to rise up against the peace of both heaven and the King.</p>

<p>Good Lord of Lancaster, I am not here as an enemy your father’s peace.

I sent you a detailed list of our grievances, but you angrily shoved it aside. That’s why this Hydra of a war has broken out. You can get rid of it by agreeing to the just and right things we demand.
