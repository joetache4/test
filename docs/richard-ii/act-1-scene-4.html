<p>That words seem’d buried in my sorrow’s grave.</p>

<p>“Goodbye.” But I didn’t say it back, because that word has always been a way to disguise my grief when leaving someone, and I certainly didn’t have any grief to disguise this time. In fact, if saying goodbye would have made hours longer and added years to his banishment, I would have given him many goodbyes. But I knew that it wouldn’t, so I gave him none.</p>

<p>He is our cousin, cousin; but ’tis doubt,</p>

<p>Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green</p>
<p>Observed his courtship to the common people;</p>
<p>How he did seem to dive into their hearts</p>
<p>With humble and familiar courtesy,</p>
<p>What reverence he did throw away on slaves,</p>
<p>Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles</p>
<p>And patient underbearing of his fortune,</p>
<p>As ’twere to banish their affects with him.</p>
<p>Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;</p>
<p>A brace of draymen bid God speed him well</p>
<p>And had the tribute of his supple knee,</p>
<p>With “Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;”</p>
<p>As were our England in reversion his,</p>
<p>And he our subjects’ next degree in hope.</p>

<b>KING RICHARD II</b>
<p>He is our cousin, cousin. But I doubt that he’ll come see his relatives when he returns home from his exile. Bushy, Bagot, Green, and I watched how he courts the common people, and he seems to endear himself to them with humble courtesy. He wasted reverence on slaves and courted poor craftsman with smiles and a patient acceptance of his fate, as though he were hoping to take their affection with him into exile. He took off his hat to a woman selling oysters. Several oxen drivers blessed his journey, and he went on one knee and told them, “Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends.” It was as though my England were his and my subjects were placing their hope in him.</p>

<p>lease out our right to tax the people. The revenue from that will keep the country running. If that doesn’t bring in enough, then my deputies here will have authority to make the rich lords turn over however much of their gold we choose to supply what we need. I’ll leave for Ireland at once.</p>
