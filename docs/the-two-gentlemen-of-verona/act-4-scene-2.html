<p>Already have I been false to Valentine,</p>

<p>In breaking faith with Julia, whom I loved.</p>
<p>And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,</p>
<p>The least whereof would quell a lover’s hope,</p>
<p>Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,</p>
<p>The more it grows and fawneth on her still.</p>

<b>PROTEUS</b>
<p>I’ve already had to lie to Valentine, and now I must be just as unfair to Thurio. Under the guise of praising him, I now have the ability to express my own feelings of love to Sylvia. But Sylvia is too beautiful, too faithful, too holy to be corrupted by my worthless praises. When I declare my loyalty to her, she criticizes me for being false to my friend, Valentine. When I praise her beauty, she tells me to think about how I’ve been unfaithful to Julia, whom I once loved. And yet, despite all of her scolding, the least of which could kill a lover’s hopes, my love grows and fawns on her like a dog the more she spurns it. But here comes Thurio. Now we must go to her window and play some evening music for her to hear.</p>
