<p>Go, fellow, go. Return unto thy lord.</p>

<p>Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us</p>
<p>Whereof I shall not have intelligence.</p>
<p>Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance.</p>
<p>And for his dreams, I wonder he’s so simple</p>
<p>To trust the mock’ry of unquiet slumbers.</p>
<p>To fly the boar before the boar pursues</p>
<p>Were to incense the boar to follow us</p>
<p>And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.</p>
<p>Go, bid thy master rise and come to me,</p>

<p>Where he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.</p>

<p>Go, man, return to your lord and tell him not to worry about the separate meetings. While he and I are at one, my loyal servant Catesby will be at the other, so nothing will happen that we won’t find out about. Tell your master there is no sound basis for his worries. And as for his dreams, I’m surprised he’s so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night. If we flee from the boar before the boar even pursues us, we’ll only make the boar angry and suspicious, causing him to chase us when he never intended to. Tell your master to get up and come here, and we’ll go together to the Tower to meet the boar, who will treat us well, as he’ll see.</p>
