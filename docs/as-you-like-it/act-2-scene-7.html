<p>A fool, a fool, I met a fool i’ th’ forest,</p>
<p>A motley fool. A miserable world!</p>
<p>As I do live by food, I met a fool,</p>
<p>Who laid him down and basked him in the sun</p>
<p>And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,</p>
<p>In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.</p>
<p>“Good morrow, fool,” quoth I. “No, sir,” quoth he,</p>
<p>“Call me not ’fool’ till heaven hath sent me fortune.”</p>
<p>And then he drew a dial from his poke</p>
<p>And, looking on it with lackluster eye,</p>
<p>Says very wisely, “It is ten o’clock.</p>
<p>Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags.</p>
<p>’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,</p>
<p>And after one hour more ’twill be eleven.</p>
<p>And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,</p>
<p>And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,</p>
<p>The motley fool thus moral on the time,</p>
<p>And thereby hangs a tale.” When I did hear</p>
<p>My lungs began to crow like chanticleer</p>
<p>That fools should be so deep-contemplative,</p>
<p>And I did laugh sans intermission</p>
<p>An hour by his dial. O noble fool!</p>
<p>A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear.</p>

<p>A fool, a fool! I met a fool in the forest, wearing motley. What a miserable world! As sure as I eat to stay alive, I met a fool who was lying in the sun and complaining about his fortune. He spoke smartly, though he was a fool. “Good morning, fool,” I said. “No, sir,” he said, “don’t call me a fool until heaven has sent me my fortune.” Then he pulled a watch from his bag and, looking at it solemnly, said, “It’s ten o’clock. This way, we can see how the world moves. Only an hour ago it was nine, and in another hour it will be eleven. And so, from hour to hour we ripen, and from hour to hour we rot. And there’s a story behind that.” When I heard that motley fool moralizing on the subject of time, I began to crow like a rooster. Hearing a fool speaking so contemplatively made me laugh non-stop for an hour. Oh, noble fool! A worthy fool! Motley is the only thing to wear.</p>

<p>And they that are most gallèd with my folly,</p>

<p>That’s all I ask from you, as long as you promise to rid yourself of any rotten idea that I am wise. Like the wind, I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please, as fools do. And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest. Why, sir, must he? Well, it’s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church. Any person who thinks I’m satirizing them would be stupid if they didn’t pretend not to be hurt by my joke. Otherwise, they’d be admitting I was talking about them, and the fool would expose the wise man’s foolishness with a joke that wasn’t even meant for him. Dress me up in motley. Let me speak my mind, and I’ll rid the world of its sickness—if it will only tolerate my medicine.</p>

What woman in the city am I talking about when I say that the clothes on a city-woman’s unworthy back are rich enough to suit a prince? Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her? And when some lowlife protests that <em>his</em> fancy clothes aren’t my problem, isn’t he basically admitting that I’m talking about him? Well, then. Tell me how I’ve wronged him. If I was right about him, he’s the one who’s done wrong. If he isn’t guilty of the faults I’m talking about, well then, my accusations fly by like wild geese, whom no one owns, since they don’t apply to any man. But who is this?</p>

<p>The whole world is a stage, and all the men and women merely actors. They have their exits and their entrances, and in his lifetime a man will play many parts, his life separated into seven acts. In the first act he is an infant, whimpering and puking in his nurse’s arms. Then he’s the whining schoolboy, with a book bag and a bright, young face, creeping like a snail unwillingly to school. Then he becomes a lover, huffing and puffing like a furnace as he writes sad poems about his mistress’ eyebrows. In the fourth act, he’s a soldier, full of foreign curses, with a beard like a panther, eager to defend his honor and quick to fight. On the battlefield, he puts himself in front of the cannon’s mouth, risking his life to seek fame that is as fleeting as a soap bubble. In the fifth act, he is a judge, with a nice fat belly from all the bribes he’s taken. His eyes are stern, and he’s given his beard a respectable cut. He’s full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes: that’s the way he plays his part. In the sixth act, the curtain rises on a skinny old man in slippers, glasses on his nose and a money bag at his side. The stockings he wore in his youth hang loosely on his shriveled legs now, and his bellowing voice has shrunk back down to a childish squeak. In the last scene of our play—the end of this strange, eventful history—our hero, full of forgetfulness, enters his second childhood: without teeth, without eyes, without taste, without everything.</p>

<p><em>Even though you can freeze water</em></p>
<p><em>Your sting is not as sharp</em></p>
<p><em>As the friend who is forgotten.</em></p>
<p><em>Heigh-ho! Sing, heigh-ho! Sing to the green holly.</em></p>
<p><em>Most friendship is false, most love simply foolishness.</em></p>
<p><em>Then heigh-ho, to the holly.</em></p>
<p><em>This life is really jolly.</em></p>

<p>Go to my cave and tell me.—Good old man,</p>

<b>DUKE SENIOR</b>
<p>If you really are Sir Rowland’s son, as you’ve just whispered to me—and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face— you are truly welcome here. I am the duke who loved your father. Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story.—Good old man, you are as welcome here as your master is. Give him your arm. Give me your hand, and explain your situation to me.</p>
