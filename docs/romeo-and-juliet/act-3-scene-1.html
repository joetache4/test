<p>Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou, why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.

Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling. Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun.

<p>If there were two men like you, pretty soon there’d be none because the two of you would kill each other.

You’ll fight with a man who’s cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes. Only you would look for a fight like that. Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk, but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting. You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun. Didn’t you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season? And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces? And yet you’re the one who wants to teach me about restraint!</p>

<p>Tybalt here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay.</p>
<p>Romeo, that spoke him fair, bade him bethink</p>
<p>How nice the quarrel was and urged withal</p>
<p>Your high displeasure. All this uttered</p>
<p>With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed,</p>
<p>Could not take truce with the unruly spleen</p>
<p>Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts</p>
<p>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,</p>
<p>Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,</p>
<p>And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats</p>
<p>Cold death aside and with the other sends</p>
<p>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,</p>
<p>Retorts it. Romeo, he cries aloud,</p>
<p>“Hold, friends! Friends, part!” and, swifter than his tongue,</p>
<p>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,</p>
<p>And ’twixt them rushes—underneath whose arm</p>
<p>An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life</p>
<p>Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.</p>
<p>But by and by comes back to Romeo,</p>
<p>Who had but newly entertained revenge,</p>
<p>And to ’t they go like lightning, for ere I</p>
<p>Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain.</p>
<p>And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.</p>
<p>This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</p>

<b>BENVOLIO</b>
<p>Tybalt started the fight before he was killed by Romeo. Romeo spoke to Tybalt politely and told him how silly this argument was. He mentioned that you would not approve of the fight. He said all of this gently and calmly, kneeling down out of respect. But he could not make peace with Tybalt, who was in an angry mood and wouldn’t listen to talk about peace. Tybalt and Mercutio began to fight each other fiercely, lunging at one another and dodging each other’s blows. Romeo cried out, “Stop, my friends. Break it up.” Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down. But Tybalt reached under Romeo’s arm and thrust his sword into brave Mercutio. Then Tybalt fled the scene. But pretty soon he came back to meet Romeo, who was overcome with the desire for revenge. As quick as lightning, they started fighting. Before I could break up the fight, Tybalt was killed. Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead. I’m telling you the truth, I swear on my life.</p>

<p>Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,</p>

<p>Benvolio is part of the Montague family. His loyalties to the Montagues make him tell lies. He’s not telling the truth. There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot, and together those twenty could only kill one man. I demand justice. You, Prince, are the man who can give me justice. Romeo killed Tybalt.

<b>PRINCE</b>
<p>And for that crime, Romeo is hereby exiled from Verona. I’m involved in your rivalry. Mercutio was my relative, and he lies dead because of your bloody feud. I’ll punish you so harshly that you’ll regret causing me this loss. I won’t listen to your pleas or excuses. You can’t get out of trouble by praying or crying, so don’t bother. Tell Romeo to leave the city immediately, or else, if he is found, he will be killed. Take away this body, and do what I say. Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders.</p>
