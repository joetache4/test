  - os: "Enter SOLANIO and SALARINO"
    ms: "SOLANIO and SALARINO enter"

  - sp: SOLANIO
    o:
      - "Now, what news on the Rialto?"
    m:
      - "So, what’s the news on the Rialto?"

  - sp: SALARINO
    o:
      - "Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the narrow seas. The Goodwins I think they call the place—a very dangerous flat, and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip report be an honest woman of her word."
    m:
      - "Well, there’s a rumor that Antonio had a ship carrying expensive cargo that shipwrecked in the English Channel on the Goodwin Sands, a very dangerous sandbar. Many ships have sunk there, according to rumors."

  - sp: SOLANIO
    o:
      - "I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio—oh, that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!—"
    m:
      - "I hope this new rumor is a lie, like the gossiping widow’s claim that she was sorry her third husband died! But it’s true—I don’t want to get all mushy and go on and on, but the good Antonio, the honest Antonio—oh, if I only had a title good enough to match his!—"

  - sp: SALARINO
    o:
      - "Come, the full stop."
    m:
      - "Come on, get to the point."

  - sp: SOLANIO
    o:
      - "Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is he hath lost a ship."
    m:
      - "What are you saying? Well, the point is, he’s lost a ship."

  - sp: SALARINO
    o:
      - "I would it might prove the end of his losses."
    m:
      - "I hope that’s all he loses."

  - sp: SOLANIO
    o:
      - "Let me say “Amen” betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew."
    m:
      - "Let me say “amen” quickly, before the devil comes in and stops my prayer—because here comes the devil, disguised as a Jew."

  - os: "Enter SHYLOCK"
    ms: "SHYLOCK enters."

  - o:
      - "How now, Shylock? What news among the merchants?"
    m:
      - "How’s it going, Shylock? What’s the news among the merchants?"

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "You knew—none so well, none so well as you—of my daughter’s flight."
    m:
      - "You knew—no one knew, no one knew as well as you did—about my daughter’s plans to run away."

  - sp: SALARINO
    o:
      - "That’s certain. I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal."
    m:
      - "That’s true. I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off."

  - sp: SOLANIO
    o:
      - "And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged, and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam."
    m:
      - "And Shylock knew his daughter was ready to run away. It’s natural for children to leave their parents."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "She is damned for it."
    m:
      - "She’ll be damned for it."

  - sp: SOLANIO
    o:
      - "That’s certain—if the devil may be her judge."
    m:
      - "That’s true—if the devil’s judging her."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "My own flesh and blood to rebel!"
    m:
      - "My own flesh and blood turned against me! A rebel!"

  - sp: SOLANIO
    o:
      - "Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?"
    m:
      - "No! Your flesh still rebels at your age?"

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "I say my daughter is my flesh and blood."
    m:
      - "I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood."

  - sp: SALARINO
    o:
      - "There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?"
    m:
      - "You two are totally different. Your flesh is more different from hers than coal is from ivory. There’s more difference between your bloods than between red wine and white. But tell us, did you hear anything about Antonio’s loss at sea?"

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "There I have another bad match!—a bankrupt, a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart. Let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond. He was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him look to his bond."
    m:
      - "That’s another bad deal I’ve made!—a bankrupt, a spendthrift, who now has to hide his head on the Rialto, a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants. Let him think about his own debt. He liked to call me a loan shark; let him think about his debt to me. He used to lend money as a favor between Christians; but now, let him think about his own debt."

  - sp: SALARINO
    o:
      - "Why, I am sure, if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh."
      - "What’s that good for?"
    m:
      - "But you won’t take his flesh if he can’t pay. What’s that good for?"

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "To bait fish withal. If it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies—and what’s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me I will execute—and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction."
    m:
      - "I’ll use it for fish bait. You can’t eat human flesh, but if it feeds nothing else, it’ll feed my revenge. He’s insulted me and cost me half a million ducats. He’s laughed at my losses, made fun of my earnings, humiliated my race, thwarted my deals, turned my friends against me, riled up my enemies—and why? Because I’m a Jew. Doesn’t a Jew have eyes? Doesn’t a Jew have hands, bodily organs, a human shape, five senses, feelings, and passions? Doesn’t a Jew eat the same food, get hurt with the same weapons, get sick with the same diseases, get healed by the same medicine, and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian? If you prick us with a pin, don’t we bleed? If you tickle us, don’t we laugh? If you poison us, don’t we die? And if you treat us badly, won’t we try to get revenge? If we’re like you in everything else, we’ll resemble you in that respect. If a Jew offends a Christian, what’s the Christian’s kind and gentle reaction? Revenge. If a Christian offends a Jew, what punishment will he come up with if he follows the Christian example? Of course, the same thing—revenge! I’ll treat you as badly as you Christians taught me to—and you’ll be lucky if I don’t outdo my teachers."

  - os: "Enter a MAN from ANTONIO"
    ms: "One of ANTONIO’s SERVANTS enters."

  - sp: MAN
    o:
      - "*(to SOLANIO and SALARINO)* Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and desires to speak with you both."
    m:
      - "*(to SOLANIO and SALARINO)* My master Antonio is at his house and would like to speak to you both."

  - sp: SALARINO
    o:
      - "We have been up and down to seek him."
    m:
      - "We’ve been looking for him everywhere."

  - os: "Enter TUBAL"
    ms: "TUBAL enters."

  - sp: SOLANIO
    o:
      - "Here comes another of the tribe. A third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew."
    m:
      - "Here comes another Jew. You couldn’t find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a Jew."

  - os: "Exeunt SOLANIO, SALARINO, and MAN"
    ms: "SOLANIO, SALARINO, and ANTONIO’s SERVANT exit."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "How now, Tubal? What news from Genoa? Hast thou found my daughter?"
    m:
      - "Hello, Tubal. Any news from Genoa? Did you find my daughter?"

  - sp: TUBAL
    o:
      - "I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her."
    m:
      - "I went to many places where I heard news about her, but I couldn’t find her."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "Why, there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt—the curse never fell upon our nation till now! I never felt it till now—Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear! Would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin! No news of them? Why, so. And I know not what’s spent in the search. Why thou, loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief—and no satisfaction, no revenge. Nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o’ my shoulders, no sighs but o’ my breathing, no tears but o’ my shedding."
    m:
      - "Oh, oh, oh! One of the stolen diamonds cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt! I never felt the curse of the Jews until now. I never felt it until now—two thousand ducats in that diamond, and other precious, precious jewels! I wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels! I wish she were in her coffin here, with the ducats in her coffin! You couldn’t find out anything about them? Why? I don’t even know how much I’m spending to find them. Loss upon loss! The thief left with so much, and I’m spending so much to hunt down the thief—and still I’m not satisfied! I haven’t gotten my revenge. The only luck I have is bad luck. Nobody suffers but me. Nobody’s crying except me."

  - sp: TUBAL
    o:
      - "Yes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard in"
      - "Genoa—"
    m:
      - "Well, other men have bad luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa—"

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?"
    m:
      - "What, what, what? Bad luck, bad luck?"

  - sp: TUBAL
    o:
      - "Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis."
    m:
      - "He’s had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "I thank God, I thank God! Is ’t true, is ’t true?"
    m:
      - "Thank God, thank God! Is it true, is it true?"

  - sp: TUBAL
    o:
      - "I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack."
    m:
      - "I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa."
    m:
      - "Thank you, Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa."

  - sp: TUBAL
    o:
      - "Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one night fourscore ducats."
    m:
      - "I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "Thou stickest a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!"
    m:
      - "Oh, you’re sticking a dagger in me! I’ll never see my gold again. Eighty ducats in one shot! Eighty ducats!"

  - sp: TUBAL
    o:
      - "There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break."
    m:
      - "I came to Venice with a number of Antonio’s creditors who say he won’t be able to avoid going bankrupt."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "I am very glad of it. I’ll plague him. I’ll torture him. I am glad of it."
    m:
      - "I’m very glad about that. I’ll hound him. I’ll torture him. I’m very glad."

  - sp: TUBAL
    o:
      - "One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey."
    m:
      - "One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise. I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys."
    m:
      - "Damn her! You’re torturing me, Tubal. That was my turquoise ring! Leah gave it to me before we were married. I wouldn’t have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys."

  - sp: TUBAL
    o:
      - "But Antonio is certainly undone."
    m:
      - "But Antonio’s certainly ruined."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer. Bespeak him a fortnight before.—I will have the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will.—Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue. Go, good Tubal. At our synagogue, Tubal."
    m:
      - "That’s true, that’s very true. Tubal, go find me a police officer to arrest Antonio. Get him ready two weeks ahead of time.—I’ll take Antonio’s heart if he can’t pay. With him out of Venice, I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend money.—Go, Tubal. Meet me at the synagogue."

  - os: "Exeunt severally"
    ms: "They exit."
