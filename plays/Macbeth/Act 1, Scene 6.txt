    ms: "The stage is lit by torches. Hautboys play. DUNCAN enters, together with MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS, and their attendants."

  - sp: DUNCAN
    o:
      - "This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air"
      - "Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself"
      - "Unto our gentle senses."
    m:
      - "This castle is in a pleasant place. The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses."

  - sp: BANQUO
    o:
      - "    This guest of summer,"
      - "The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,"
      - "By his loved mansionry, that the heaven’s breath"
      - "Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,"
      - "Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird"
      - "Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle."
      - "Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,"
      - "The air is delicate."
    m:
      - "The fact that this summer bird, the house martin, builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are. There isn’t a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven’t built their hanging nests to sleep and breed. I’ve noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest."

  - os: "Enter LADY MACBETH"
    ms: "LADY MACBETH enters."

  - sp: DUNCAN
    o:
      - "    See, see, our honored hostess!"
      - "The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,"
      - "Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you"
      - "How you shall bid God ’ild us for your pains,"
      - "And thank us for your trouble."
    m:
      - "Look, here comes our honored hostess! Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient, but I still accept it as love. In doing so, I’m teaching you to thank me for the incovenience I’m causing you by being here, because it comes from my love to you."

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "    All our service,"
      - "In every point twice done and then done double,"
      - "Were poor and single business to contend"
      - "Against those honors deep and broad wherewith"
      - "Your majesty loads our house. For those of old,"
      - "And the late dignities heaped up to them,"
      - "We rest your hermits."
    m:
      - "Everything we’re doing for you, even if it were doubled and then doubled again, is nothing compared to the honors you have brought to our family. We gladly welcome you as our guests, with gratitude for both the honors you’ve given us before and the new honors you’ve just given us."

  - sp: DUNCAN
    o:
      - "    Where’s the thane of Cawdor?"
      - "We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose"
      - "To be his purveyor; but he rides well,"
      - "And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him"
      - "To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,"
      - "We are your guest tonight."
    m:
      - "Where is Macbeth, the thane of Cawdor? We followed closely after him. I hoped to arrive here before him, but he rides swiftly. And his great love, which is as sharp as his spur, helped him beat us here. Fair and noble hostess, we are your guests tonight."

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "    Your servants ever"
      - "Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt,"
      - "To make their audit at your highness’ pleasure,"
      - "Still to return your own."
    m:
      - "We are your servants, your highness, and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal, for after all, we keep it in your trust and we’re glad to give you back what’s yours."

  - sp: DUNCAN
    o:
      - "    Give me your hand."
      - "Conduct me to mine host. We love him highly"
      - "And shall continue our graces towards him."
      - "By your leave, hostess."
    m:
      - "Give me your hand. Bring me to my host, Macbeth. I love him dearly, and I shall continue to favor him. Whenever you’re ready, hostess."
