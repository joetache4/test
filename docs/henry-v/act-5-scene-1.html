<p>There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things. I will tell you as my friend, Captain Gower.

It was in place where I could not breed no contention with him, but I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again, and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires.</p>

<p>There are reasons and causes why and how in everything.

We were somewhere where I couldn’t pick a fight with him, but I’ve decided to wear it in my cap until I see him again, whereupon I’ll give him a little piece of my mind.</p>
