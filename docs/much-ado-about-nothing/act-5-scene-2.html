<p>I mean in singing. But in loving, Leander the good swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and a whole bookful of these quondam carpetmongers, whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I cannot show it in rhyme. I have tried. I can find out no rhyme to “lady” but “baby”—an innocent rhyme; for “scorn,” “horn”—a hard rhyme; for, “school,” “fool”—a babbling rhyme; very ominous endings. No, I was not born under a rhyming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.</p>

<p><em>And he knows me, he knows me</em></p>
<p><em>He knows how much pity I deserve—</em></p>
<p>I’m really a pitiful singer. But as a lover, well, that’s another story. Take Leander, Troilus, or an entire book’s worth of those legendary lover-boys, whose names sound so smooth and nice in a line of verse—not one of them has been driven as crazy by love as I have been. But I can’t prove it in a poem. I have tried. I can’t think of any rhyme for “lady” but “baby,” which is a childish rhyme. The only rhyme for “scorn” I can come up with is “horn”—a bit off for a love poem. Nothing rhymes with “school” but “fool,” and that’s a ridiculous jingle. These are all very unpromising line endings. No, I wasn’t destined to be a poet, and I can’t woo a lady with pretty words.</p>
