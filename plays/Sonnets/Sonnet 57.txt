      - "Being your slave, what should I do but tend"
      - "Upon the hours and times of your desire?"
      - "I have no precious time at all to spend,"
      - "Nor services to do, till you require."
      - "Nor dare I chide the world without end hour"
      - "Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,"
      - "Nor think the bitterness of absence sour"
      - "When you have bid your servant once adieu."
      - "Nor dare I question with my jealous thought"
      - "Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,"
      - "But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought"
      - "Save, where you are, how happy you make those."
      - "  So true a fool is love that in your will,"
      - "  Though you do anything, he thinks no ill."
    m:
      - "Since I’m your slave, what else should I do but wait on the hours, and for the times when you’ll want me? I don’t have any valuable time to spend, or any services to do, until you need me. Nor do I dare complain about how agonizingly long the hours are while I watch the clock for you, my king, or how bitter your absence is after you’ve said goodbye to your servant. Nor do I dare ask jealous questions about where you might be, or speculate about your affairs, but like a sad slave I sit still and think about nothing except how happy you’re making whomever you’re with. Love makes a person such a faithful fool that no matter what you do to satisfy your desires, he doesn’t think you’ve done anything wrong."
