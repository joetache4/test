<p>Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor.</p>
<p>There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice</p>
<p>Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.</p>
<p>Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula</p>
<p>Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse</p>
<p>Is all of her. Say that thou overheardst us,</p>
<p>And bid her steal into the pleachèd bower</p>
<p>Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun</p>
<p>Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites</p>
<p>Made proud by princes, that advance their pride</p>
<p>Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her</p>
<p>To listen our propose. This is thy office.</p>
<p>Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.</p>

<b>HERO</b>
<p>Margaret, run into the sitting room. You’ll find Beatrice there, talking to Claudio and the Prince. Whisper to her that Ursula and I are walking in the orchard and that we’re talking all about her. Tell her you heard us, and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun. (The same honeysuckles that were once ripened in the sun; they’re like courtiers who rise because the king favors them, then plot to overthrow his Majesty.) She can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation. This is your job. Do it well, and then leave us.</p>

<p>Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,</p>

<p>All right Ursula, as Beatrice arrives, we’ll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but Benedick. Whenever I mention him, praise him more than any man deserves.

<p>O god of love! I know he doth deserve</p>
<p>As much as may be yielded to a man,</p>
<p>But Nature never framed a woman’s heart</p>
<p>Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.</p>
<p>Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,</p>
<p>Misprizing what they look on, and her wit</p>
<p>Values itself so highly that to her</p>

<p>She is so self-endeared.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>HERO</b>
<p>By the god of love, I know that he deserves all that a man might possess. But Nature never made a woman’s heart as proud and tough as Beatrice’s. There is scorn and disdain in her eyes, and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon. She values her wit more highly than anything else, which looks weak by comparison. She’s so in love with herself, she’s incapable of loving anyone else. She can’t even imagine what “love” is.</p>

<p>Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,</p>
<p>How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured</p>
<p>But she would spell him backward. If fair-faced,</p>
<p>She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;</p>
<p>If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic,</p>
<p>Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;</p>
<p>If low, an agate very vilely cut;</p>
<p>If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;</p>
<p>If silent, why, a block moved with none.</p>
<p>So turns she every man the wrong side out</p>
<p>And never gives to truth and virtue that</p>
<p>Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>HERO</b>
<p>It’s true. Whenever she meets a man—no matter how wise, noble, young, handsome—she rearranges all his good qualities so they end up looking bad. If he has a fair complexion, she’ll say the pretty man should be her sister, not her husband. If he’s dark-skinned, Nature must have spilled some ink while drawing his foolish face. If he’s tall, she’ll say he’s a spear topped by an odd head; if he’s short, she says he looks like a badly carved miniature. If he’s talkative, he’s a weathervane, moving in all directions at once; if he’s silent, he’s a block that can’t be moved at all. And so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has.</p>

<p>No, not to be so odd and from all fashions</p>

<p>Out of myself, press me to death with wit.</p>
<p>Therefore let Benedick, like covered fire,</p>
<p>Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.</p>
<p>It were a better death than die with mocks,</p>
<p>Which is as bad as die with tickling.</p>

<b>HERO</b>
<p>No, it certainly is not admirable to be so perverse and eccentric. But who would dare tell her? If I said something, she’d mock me so mercilessly that I’d probably disintegrate into air. She’d laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit. So Benedick should conceal his emotions. Like a fire that gets covered up, Benedick should smother his love and waste away. It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked, which is as bad as being killed by tickling.</p>
