    ms: "DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS enter."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile."
      - "We have some secrets to confer about."
    m:
      - "Sir Thurio, leave us alone a while, please. We have some private matters to discuss."

  - os: "Exit THURIO"
    ms: "THURIO exits."

  - o:
      - "Now tell me, Proteus, what’s your will with me?"
    m:
      - "Now tell me, Proteus, why did you want to see me?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "My gracious lord, that which I would discover"
      - "The law of friendship bids me to conceal;"
      - "But when I call to mind your gracious favors"
      - "Done to me, undeserving as I am,"
      - "My duty pricks me on to utter that"
      - "Which else no worldly good should draw from me."
      - "Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,"
      - "This night intends to steal away your daughter."
      - "Myself am one made privy to the plot."
      - "I know you have determined to bestow her"
      - "On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;"
      - "And should she thus be stolen away from you,"
      - "It would be much vexation to your age."
      - "Thus, for my duty’s sake, I rather chose"
      - "To cross my friend in his intended drift"
      - "Than, by concealing it, heap on your head"
      - "A pack of sorrows which would press you down,"
      - "Being unprevented, to your timeless grave."
    m:
      - "My gracious lord, the rules of friendship require that I keep secret what I’m about to reveal to you. But when I think of all you’ve graciously done for me, undeserving as I am, my duty urges me to divulge what nothing else in the world could pull out of me. You should know, your highness, that Sir Valentine, my friend, intends to run away with your daughter tonight. I was informed of the plot. I know you’ve decided to marry her to Thurio, whom your lovely daughter hates. And should she be taken away from you this way, it would greatly upset you in your old age. So, for the sake of my duty, I chose to go against my friend and his intended scheme rather than hide it and burden your mind with a pack of sorrows that would weigh you down and send you to an early grave."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,"
      - "Which to requite, command me while I live."
      - "This love of theirs myself have often seen,"
      - "Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,"
      - "And oftentimes have purposed to forbid"
      - "Sir Valentine her company and my court."
      - "But, fearing lest my jealous aim might err,"
      - "And so, unworthily, disgrace the man—"
      - "A rashness that I ever yet have shunned—"
      - "I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find"
      - "That which thyself hast now disclosed to me."
      - "And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,"
      - "Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,"
      - "I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,"
      - "The key whereof myself have ever kept;"
      - "And thence she cannot be conveyed away."
    m:
      - "Proteus, I thank you for your honest concern. In return, ask anything you want of me while I still live. I’ve often happened to see this love of theirs for myself, when they’ve thought me asleep, and frequently I’ve considered forbidding Sir Valentine from seeing her or attending my court. But I’ve been afraid my jealousy might be misplaced, and as a result I might needlessly disgrace him—I’ve always disdained foolish impulsiveness. So I treated him kindly, only to learn of this deceitful plot you’ve just revealed. And, so you know how much I fear this, I make her sleep in one of the upper towers of the castle every night, because I know how impressionable youth can be led astray. I always keep the key myself, so that she cannot be taken away."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Know, noble lord, they have devised a means"
      - "How he her chamber window will ascend"
      - "And with a corded ladder fetch her down;"
      - "For which the youthful lover now is gone,"
      - "And this way comes he with it presently,"
      - "Where, if it please you, you may intercept him."
      - "But, good my lord, do it so cunningly"
      - "That my discovery be not aimèd at;"
      - "For, love of you, not hate unto my friend,"
      - "Hath made me publisher of this pretence."
    m:
      - "You should know, my noble lord, they have devised a way for him to climb up to her bedroom window and bring her down using a rope ladder. That’s why this young lover has gone away, but he’s coming back with it soon, allowing you to intercept him, if you like. But, my good lord, be cunning about it, so that he won’t know I told you. It was because of my love for you, not hatred for my friend, that I told you of this plot."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Upon mine honor, he shall never know"
      - "That I had any light from thee of this."
    m:
      - "I swear on my honor he will never know I learned this information from you."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Adieu, my lord. Sir Valentine is coming."
    m:
      - "Goodbye, my lord. Sir Valentine is coming."

  - os: "Exit PROTEUS"
    ms: "PROTEUS exits."

  - os: "Enter VALENTINE hurrying elsewhere, concealing a rope ladder beneath his cloak"
    ms: "VALENTINE enters, hurrying to go somewhere and concealing a rope beneath his cloak."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?"
    m:
      - "Sir Valentine, what’s the rush?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Please it your Grace, there is a messenger"
      - "That stays to bear my letters to my friends,"
      - "And I am going to deliver them."
    m:
      - "If you please, Your Grace, there is a messenger that waits to take my letters to my friends, and I am on my way to deliver them."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Be they of much import?"
    m:
      - "Are they very important?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "The tenor of them doth but signify"
      - "My health and happy being at your court."
    m:
      - "In essence they describe how healthy and happy I am here in your kingdom."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Nay then, no matter. Stay with me awhile."
      - "I am to break with thee of some affairs"
      - "That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret."
      - "’Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought"
      - "To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter."
    m:
      - "No, then, they don’t matter. Stay with me a while. I want to tell you about some affairs that affect me personally, which you must keep secret. You’re surely aware that I have sought to match my friend Sir Thurio with my daughter."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "I know it well, my lord, and sure the match"
      - "Were rich and honorable. Besides, the gentleman"
      - "Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities"
      - "Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter."
      - "Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?"
    m:
      - "I know that very well, my lord, and surely the match would be profitable and honorable. Besides, the gentleman is full of virtue, wealth, worth, and qualities fit for a wife such as your beautiful daughter. Can Your Grace not get her to want him for a husband?"

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "No, trust me. She is peevish, sullen, froward,"
      - "Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,"
      - "Neither regarding that she is my child"
      - "Nor fearing me as if I were her father."
      - "And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,"
      - "Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;"
      - "And, where I thought the remnant of mine age"
      - "Should have been cherished by her childlike duty,"
      - "I now am full resolved to take a wife,"
      - "And turn her out to who will take her in."
      - "Then let her beauty be her wedding dower,"
      - "For me and my possessions she esteems not."
    m:
      - "No, trust me. She is irritable, sullen, difficult, proud, disobedient, stubborn, irresponsible, and neither does she care that she must obey me as my child nor does she fear me as her father. And, may I tell you, after thinking about it, this pride of hers has made me love her less. I once thought she would fulfill her duty and take care of me in my old age, but now I’ve resolved to find a new wife and marry my daughter off to whomever will take her. Her beauty will be her dowry, because she doesn’t value me or my possessions."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "What would your Grace have me to do in this?"
    m:
      - "What part would Your Grace like me to play in this?"

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "There is a lady in Verona here"
      - "Whom I affect, but she is nice and coy,"
      - "And naught esteems my agèd eloquence."
      - "Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor—"
      - "For long agone I have forgot to court;"
      - "Besides, the fashion of the time is changed—"
      - "How and which way I may bestow myself"
      - "To be regarded in her sun-bright eye."
    m:
      - "There is a lady here in Verona whom I love, but she is hard to please and coy and doesn’t appreciate my old-fashioned eloquence. I’d like you to teach me how to win her over, since I long ago forgot how to court a woman, and besides, times have changed. How should I act in order for her bright eyes to take notice of me?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Win her with gifts, if she respect not words."
      - "Dumb jewels often in their silent kind"
      - "More than quick words do move a woman’s mind."
    m:
      - "Win her with gifts if she doesn’t pay attention to words. Jewels, which can’t speak, often sway a woman’s mind more than fast-talking."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "But she did scorn a present that I sent her."
    m:
      - "But she already sneered at one present I sent her."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "A woman sometime scorns what best contents her."
      - "Send her another. Never give her o’er,"
      - "For scorn at first makes after-love the more."
      - "If she do frown, ’tis not in hate of you,"
      - "But rather to beget more love in you."
      - "If she do chide, ’tis not to have you gone,"
      - "Forwhy the fools are mad if left alone."
      - "Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;"
      - "For “Get you gone,” she doth not mean “Away!’”"
      - "Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;"
      - "Though ne’er so black, say they have angels’ faces."
      - "That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man"
      - "If with his tongue he cannot win a woman."
    m:
      - "A woman will sometimes scorn the very thing that pleases her most. Send her another gift. Never give up, because her initial disdain will make her eventual feelings of love even stronger. If she frowns, it’s not out of hatred for you but rather to make you love her even more. If she chides you, it’s not so that you’ll go away, because the fools will go crazy if they’re left alone. Don’t be offended, whatever she says. By “Get out of here,” she doesn’t really mean, “Go away!” Flatter and praise women, compliment them, talk about their graces. Even if they have the blackest skin, say they have the faces of angels. In my opinion, any man that has a tongue isn’t really a man unless he can use it to win a woman."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "But she I mean is promised by her friends"
      - "Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,"
      - "And kept severely from resort of men,"
      - "That no man hath access by day to her."
    m:
      - "But the family of the woman I’m talking about has promised her to a young, worthy gentleman, and they’ve strictly kept her away from other men so that no man can meet with her during the day."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Why then I would resort to her by night."
    m:
      - "Why, then I would see her at night."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Ay, but the doors be locked and keys kept safe,"
      - "That no man hath recourse to her by night."
    m:
      - "Yes, but the doors are locked and the keys tightly guarded so that no man has access to her at night."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "What lets but one may enter at her window?"
    m:
      - "What’s stopping anyone from entering her room through the window?"

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,"
      - "And built so shelving that one cannot climb it"
      - "Without apparent hazard of his life."
    m:
      - "Her room is high up, far from the ground, and it projects out like a shelf so that one cannot climb it without risking his life."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords"
      - "To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,"
      - "Would serve to scale another Hero’s tower,"
      - "So bold Leander would adventure it."
    m:
      - "Why then, a skillfully made ladder of rope to toss up, with a pair of grappling hooks to anchor it, would work to scale this new Hero’s tower, allowing another daring Leander to climb it."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,"
      - "Advise me where I may have such a ladder."
    m:
      - "Now, from one nobleman by birth to another, tell me where I can get such a ladder."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that."
    m:
      - "When would you need to use it? Please, sir, tell me that."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "This very night; for Love is like a child,"
      - "That longs for everything that he can come by."
    m:
      - "Tonight, because Love is like a child that wants everything he sees."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "By seven o’clock I’ll get you such a ladder."
    m:
      - "I’ll get you such a ladder by seven o’clock."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "But, hark thee, I will go to her alone;"
      - "How shall I best convey the ladder thither?"
    m:
      - "But listen, I will go see her alone. What’s the best way to carry the ladder there?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it"
      - "Under a cloak that is of any length."
    m:
      - "It will be so light, my lord, that you’ll be able to carry it under any size cloak."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?"
    m:
      - "A cloak as long as yours will do?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Ay, my good lord."
    m:
      - "Yes, my lord."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Then let me see thy cloak."
      - "I’ll get me one of such another length."
    m:
      - "Then let me see your cloak. I’ll get one of that same length."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord."
    m:
      - "Why, any cloak will work just fine, my lord."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?"
      - "I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me."
    m:
      - "How will I get used to wearing a cloak? Please, let me try on your cloak."

  - os: "He pulls open VALENTINE’s cloak."
    ms: "He pulls open Valentine’s cloak."

  - o:
      - "What letter is this same? What’s here? “To Sylvia”!"
      - "And here an engine fit for my proceeding."
      - "I’ll be so bold to break the seal for once."
    m:
      - "What’s this letter? What does it say? “To Sylvia”! And a tool for climbing like the kind you suggested. I’ll be so bold as to break the seal."

  - os: "Reads"
    ms: "He reads."

  - o:
      - "“My thoughts do harbor with my Sylvia nightly,"
      - "And slaves they are to me, that send them flying."
      - "O, could their master come and go as lightly,"
      - "Himself would lodge where, senseless, they are lying!"
      - "My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them,"
      - "While I, their king, that thither them importune,"
      - "Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them,"
      - "Because myself do want my servants’ fortune."
      - "I curse myself, for they are sent by me,"
      - "That they should harbor where their lord should be.”"
      - "What’s here?"
      - "“Sylvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.”"
      - "’Tis so; and here’s the ladder for the purpose."
      - "Why, Phaëthon, for thou art Merops’ son"
      - "Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car"
      - "And with thy daring folly burn the world?"
      - "Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee?"
      - "Go, base intruder, overweening slave!"
      - "Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,"
      - "And think my patience, more than thy desert,"
      - "Is privilege for thy departure hence."
      - "Thank me for this more than for all the favors"
      - "Which, all too much, I have bestowed on thee."
      - "But if thou linger in my territories"
      - "Longer than swiftest expedition"
      - "Will give thee time to leave our royal court,"
      - "By heaven, my wrath shall far exceed the love"
      - "I ever bore my daughter or thyself."
      - "Begone! I will not hear thy vain excuse,"
      - "But, as thou lov’st thy life, make speed from hence."
    m:
      - "“My thoughts are with my Sylvia every night. They are like my slaves, and I send them flying. Oh, I wish that I could come and go to her just as easily, and lie where my thoughts, which cannot feel, are lying. Let my thoughts, which come to you as my messengers, rest in your breast, while I, their king who sent them, curse the luck that has blessed them with such favor. I want to be as fortunate as my slaves. I curse myself, too, because I sent them to the place where I, their lord, should be.” What’s this here at the end? “Sylvia, this night I will free you.” So that’s it, and here’s the ladder you planned to use. Why, Phaethon—for you are Merops’ son —will you try to drive the sun god’s chariot and burn the world in your brash idiocy? Will you grasp at the stars because they shine on you, as you grasp at my daughter for favoring you? Go, vulgar intruder, arrogant slave! Flash your fawning smiles on someone in your own class, and know that my patience—which is more than you deserve—allows you to leave this place. Thank me for this more than you’ve thanked me for all the favors I’ve granted you, which were too many. But if you stay here in my kingdom any longer than it takes to hurry away, then by heaven my anger will be far greater than any love I’ve ever felt for my daughter or for you. Get out of here! I will not hear your futile excuses. If you love your life, then you’ll hurry on your way from here."

  - os: "Exit DUKE"
    ms: "The DUKE exits."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "And why not death rather than living torment?"
      - "To die is to be banished from myself,"
      - "And Sylvia is myself. Banished from her"
      - "Is self from self—a deadly banishment!"
      - "What light is light, if Sylvia be not seen?"
      - "What joy is joy, if Sylvia be not by?"
      - "Unless it be to think that she is by"
      - "And feed upon the shadow of perfection."
      - "Except I be by Sylvia in the night,"
      - "There is no music in the nightingale;"
      - "Unless I look on Sylvia in the day,"
      - "There is no day for me to look upon."
      - "She is my essence, and I leave to be"
      - "If I be not by her fair influence"
      - "Fostered, illumined, cherished, kept alive."
      - "I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom;"
      - "Tarry I here, I but attend on death,"
      - "But, fly I hence, I fly away from life."
    m:
      - "Why not death instead of being tortured alive? To die is to be banished from myself, and Sylvia is my very being. Being banished from her is like being banished from myself—a deadly banishment! What good is light if I can’t see Sylvia? What joy is joy if Sylvia isn’t nearby? Unless I can be happy to think she is near and live on the mere thought of her perfection. Unless I can be near Sylvia in the night, there is no music in the nightingale’s singing. Unless I can look on Sylvia in the day, the day doesn’t even exist. She is my essence, and I’ll cease to exist if I’m not cared for, shined upon, valued, and kept alive by her gentle power. I don’t run from death if I run from the duke’s deadly threats. If I stay here, I am just waiting for death, but if I flee this place, then I flee from life itself."
