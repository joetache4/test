<p>Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting</p>
<p>That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay</p>
<p>Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly—</p>
<p>And praised be rashness for it: let us know</p>
<p>Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>HAMLET</b>
<p>There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn’t let me sleep. It was worse than being a captive in chains. Sometimes it’s good to be rash—sometimes it works out well to act impulsively when our careful plans lose steam. This should show us that there’s a God in heaven who’s always guiding us in the right direction, however often we screw up—</p>

<p>Fingered their packet, and in fine withdrew</p>
<p>To mine own room again, making so bold</p>
<p>(My fears forgetting manners) to unseal</p>
<p>Their grand commission, where I found, Horatio—</p>
<p>O royal knavery!—an exact command,</p>
<p>Larded with many several sorts of reasons</p>
<p>Importing Denmark’s health, and England’s too,</p>
<p>With—ho!—such bugs and goblins in my life</p>

<b>HAMLET</b>
<p>So I came up from my cabin with my robe tied around me, groped in the dark to find what I was looking for, found it, looked through their packet of papers, and returned to my cabin again. I was bold enough (I guess my fears made me forget my manners) to open the document containing the king’s instructions. And there I found, Horatio, such royal mischief—a precisely worded order, sugared with lots of talk about Denmark’s well-being and England’s too, to cut off my head, without even waiting to sharpen the ax.</p>

<p>Being thus benetted round with villainies—</p>

<p>Devised a new commission, wrote it fair.</p>
<p>I once did hold it, as our statists do,</p>
<p>A baseness to write fair, and labored much</p>

<p>So there I was, caught in their evil net. Before I could even start processing the situation, they had started the ball rolling. I sat down and wrote out a new official document with new instructions. I wrote it in a bureaucrat’s neat handwriting. I used to think having nice handwriting was for servants, just like our politicians think, and I had to work hard to overcome that prejudice—but it sure came in handy then.

<p>Heaven helped me out with that too. I had my father’s signet ring in my pocket, with the royal seal of Denmark on it.

<p>Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please His Majesty, ’tis the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose. I will win for him an I can. If not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.</p>

<p>Sir, I’m going to go for a walk in the hall here whether the king likes it or not. It’s my exercise time.

If not, I’ll only have suffered some embarrassment and a few sword hits.</p>
