<p>As the events stamps them, but they have a good cover;</p>
<p>they show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio,</p>
<p>walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine orchard, were</p>
<p>thus much overheard by a man of mine: the Prince</p>
<p>discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter</p>
<p>and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance, and if he</p>
<p>found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by</p>
<p>the top and instantly break with you of it.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ANTONIO</b>
<p>Well, it seems like good news. A servant of mine overheard the Prince and Claudio talking as they walked through my orchard. The Prince said that he is in love with Hero, your daughter, and that he is going to tell her so at the dance tonight. If he she wants to marry him, too, he’s going to find you and ask for her hand immediately.</p>

<p>No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself. But I</p>

<p>Go you and tell her of it.</p>

<p>No, no, until it comes true we’ll pretend it was just a dream we had. But my daughter should know about this, so she can be prepared with an answer just in case. Go to her and tell her for me.</p>
