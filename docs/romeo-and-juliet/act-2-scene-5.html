<p>The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.</p>
<p>In half an hour she promised to return.</p>
<p>Perchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.</p>
<p>Oh, she is lame! Love’s heralds should be thoughts,</p>
<p>Which ten times faster glide than the sun’s beams,</p>
<p>Driving back shadows over louring hills.</p>
<p>Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw love</p>
<p>And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.</p>
<p>Now is the sun upon the highmost hill</p>
<p>Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve</p>
<p>Is three long hours, yet she is not come.</p>
<p>Had she affections and warm youthful blood,</p>
<p>She would be as swift in motion as a ball.</p>
<p>My words would bandy her to my sweet love,</p>
<p>And his to me.</p>
<p>But old folks, many feign as they were dead,</p>
<p>Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.</p>

<b>JULIET</b>
<p>I sent the Nurse at nine o’clock. Maybe she can’t find him. That can’t be. Oh, she’s slow! Love’s messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten times faster than sunbeams. They should be strong enough to push shadows over the dark hills. That’s the way doves carry Venus so fast, and that’s why Cupid has wings that let him fly as fast as the wind. Now it’s noon. That’s three hours since nine o’clock, but she hasn’t come back. If she was young and passionate, she’d move as fast as a ball. My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his words would bounce her back to me. But a lot of old people act like they’re already dead—sluggish, slow, fat, and colorless, like lead.</p>

<p>Well, you have made a simple choice. You know not how to choose a man. Romeo! No, not he, though his face be better than any man’s, yet his leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I’ll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench. Serve God. What, have you dined at home?</p>

He’s not the most polite man in the world, but, believe me, he’s gentle as a lamb. Well, do what you want. Be good. Have you had lunch yet?</p>
