<p>Hie, good Sir Michael, bear this sealèd brief</p>
<p>With winged haste to the Lord Marshal,</p>

<p>Like enough you do.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, good Sir Michael, is a day</p>
<p>Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men</p>
<p>Must bide the touch. For, sir, at Shrewsbury,</p>
<p>As I am truly given to understand,</p>
<p>The King with mighty and quick-raisèd power</p>
<p>Meets with Lord Harry. And I fear, Sir Michael,</p>
<p>What with the sickness of Northumberland,</p>
<p>Whose power was in the first proportion,</p>
<p>And what with Owen Glendower’s absence thence,</p>
<p>Who with them was a rated sinew too</p>
<p>And comes not in, o’er-ruled by prophecies,</p>
<p>I fear the power of Percy is too weak</p>
<p>To wage an instant trial with the King.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ARCHBISHOP</b>
<p>I’m sure you can. Tomorrow, Sir Michael, ten thousand men will try their luck. I’m told that at Shrewsbury, the King—with a huge and quickly assembled army—will fight Harry Percy. I’m afraid, Michael, that without Northumberland, whose army was the largest of all, and without Owen Glendower, who was also being counted on but is absent because his horoscope told him to stay away, I’m afraid that Percy’s army will be too weak to fight the King right now.</p>

<p>And so there is. But yet the King hath drawn</p>
<p>The special head of all the land together:</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,</p>
<p>The noble Westmoreland, and warlike Blunt,</p>
<p>And many more corrivals and dear men</p>
<p>Of estimation and command in arms.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ARCHBISHOP</b>
<p>That’s correct. But the King has pulled together the best men in the country: the Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, the noble Westmoreland, warlike Blunt, and many other acquaintances and valuable men of good reputation, with great skill in battle.</p>

<b>ARCHBISHOP</b>
<p>I hope no less, yet needful ’tis to fear;</p>
<p>And to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed.</p>
<p>For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the King</p>
<p>Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,</p>
<p>For he hath heard of our confederacy,</p>
<p>And ’tis but wisdom to make strong against him:</p>
<p>Therefore make haste. I must go write again</p>
<p>To other friends. And so farewell, Sir Michael.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ARCHBISHOP</b>
<p>I hope so, but still I’m afraid. Now hurry, Sir Michael, to prevent an absolute disaster. For if Percy doesn’t prevail, the King will come after us before he disbands his army. He’s heard that we’re part of the rebellion, so we’d be wise to prepare against him. Now hurry. I have to go write to more friends. Farewell, Sir Michael.</p>
