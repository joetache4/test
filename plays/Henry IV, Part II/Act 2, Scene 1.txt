  - sp: MISTRESS QUICKLY
    o:

      - "devil. He will spare neither man, woman, nor child."
    m:
      - "Oh my goodness! Watch out for him: he stabbed me in my own house, and it was nasty. I swear, he doesn’t care what trouble he causes. Once he’s got his weapon out, he’ll thrust it like the devil. He won’t spare man, woman, or child."

    m:
      - "If I can grab him once, if he just comes within my grasp-"

  - sp: MISTRESS QUICKLY
    o:
      - "I am undone by his going. I warrant you, he’s an infinitive"
      - "thing upon my score. Good Master Fang, hold him sure."
      - "Good Master Snare, let him not ’scape. He comes"
      - "continuantly to Pie Corner, saving your manhoods, to buy a"
      - "saddle, and he is indited to dinner to the Lubber’s Head in"
      - "Lumbert Street, to Master Smooth’s the silkman. I pray you,"
      - "since my exion is entered, and my case so openly known to"
      - "the world, let him be brought in to his answer. A hundred"
      - "mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to bear, and I have"
      - "borne, and borne, and borne, and have been fubbed off, and"
      - "fubbed off, and fubbed off from this day to that day, that it"
      - "is a shame to be thought on. There is no honesty in such"
      - "dealing, unless a woman should be made an ass and a beast"
      - "to bear every knave’s wrong. Yonder he comes, and that"
      - "errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph, with him. Do your"

      - "me, do me, do me your offices."
    m:
      - "I’m bankrupt from his never paying. He’s run up an infinitive bill with me. Catch him, Master Fang! Don’t let him get away, Master Snare! He’s always going to Pie Corner—sorry to mention it—to buy a saddle. And every day he gets indited to lunch with Master Smooth the silk seller, at the Leopard’s Head on Lumbert Street. Please bring him to justice. I’ve been entered—I mean, my lawsuit’s been entered at court, and the whole world knows how easy I am—I mean how easy it was for him to rip me off. A hundred marks is a lot for a poor, solitary woman to take. And I’ve taken it, and taken it, and taken it. And I’ve been fobbed off and fobbed off and fobbed off, day in and day out. It’s horrible to even think about. That’s a terrible way to treat people, unless you think that every woman should be made an ass and an animal, and that she should be opened to every jerk’s molestation. Here he comes, with that notorious wine-faced crook, Bardolph. Do me a favor and do me your jobs, Master Fang and Master Snare. Do me! Do me! Do me a favor and do me your jobs!"

    m:

      - "  upon him?"
    m:
      - "Well if it isn’t Sir John! Are you making trouble here? Is this appropriate for a man of your position, your age, and your responsibilities? You should be well on your way to York by now. *(to FANG)* Get off him, man. Why are you holding him?"

  - sp: MISTRESS QUICKLY
    o:

    m:
      - "What sum does he owe you?"

  - sp: MISTRESS QUICKLY
    o:

    m:

      - "would endure this tempest of exclamation? Are you not"
      - "ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to"
      - "come by her own?"
    m:
      - "What is this, Sir John? Damn! How could any decent man put up with this storm of screaming and cursing? Aren’t you ashamed to force a poor widow to take these extreme measures simply to get what’s hers?"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "*(to MISTRESS QUICKLY)* What is the gross sum that I owe thee?"
    m:

  - sp: MISTRESS QUICKLY
    o:
      - "Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the money"
      - "too. Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting"
      - "in my Dolphin chamber at the round table by a sea-coal fire,"
      - "upon Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the Prince broke"
      - "thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of Windsor,"
      - "thou didst swear to me then, as I was washing thy wound, to"
      - "marry me and make me my lady thy wife. Canst thou deny"
      - "it? Did not goodwife Keech, the butcher’s wife, come in then"
      - "and call me Gossip Quickly, coming in to borrow a mess of"
      - "vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns, whereby"
      - "thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told thee they were"
      - "ill for a green wound? And didst thou not, when she was"
      - "gone downstairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity with"
      - "such poor people, saying that ere long they should call me"
      - "madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee"
      - "thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy book-oath. Deny it if"
      - "thou canst."
    m:
      - "My goodness! If you were an honest man, you’d give yourself to me, as well as the money. You swore to me—over a gold-plated wine goblet, in the Dolphin Room in my tavern, at the round table, next to the fire, on the Wednesday seven weeks after Easter, when the Prince swung at your head for claiming his father was a fake—you swore, while I was cleaning your wounds, to marry me and make me a proper lady and your wife. Can you deny it? Didn’t Mrs. Baconfat, the butcher’s wife, come into the room then and ask to borrow some vinegar, saying that she had some good prawns—and you wanted to eat some, and I told you that it was a bad idea, to eat shrimp when you had a fresh wound—and when she left, didn’t you tell me to stop being friends with low types like her, because before long we’d be married and I’d be a proper lady? And didn’t you kiss me and tell me to lend you thirty shillings? Put your hand on the bible and deny it, if you dare."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "My lord, this is a poor mad soul, and she says up and down"
      - "the town that her eldest son is like you. She hath been in good"
      - "case, and the truth is, poverty hath distracted her. But, for"
      - "these foolish officers, I beseech you I may have redress"
      - "against them."
    m:
      - "Sir, this is a poor, insane soul. She’s been saying all over town that her oldest son looks just like you. She was once rich, but poverty has driven her crazy. Now, as for these two foolish officers, I would like to press charges against them."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your manner"
      - "of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a"
      - "confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such"
      - "more than impudent sauciness from you, can thrust me from"
      - "a level consideration. You have, as it appears to me,"
      - "practiced upon the easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and"
      - "made her serve your uses both in purse and in person."
    m:
      - "Sir John, Sir John. I know too well how you are accustomed to turning the truth into a big lie. But neither your confident demeanor nor the storm of words that accompanies your insolent disrespect will sway me from making a just consideration. As far as I can see, you’ve taken advantage of this trusting woman, and you’ve made her give you cash and other favors."

  - sp: MISTRESS QUICKLY
    o:
      - "Yea, in truth, my lord."
    m:
      - "Yes, truthfully, sir."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "Pray thee, peace.— *(to FALSTAFF)* Pay her the debt you owe"
      - "her, and unpay the villany you have done her. The one you"
      - "may do with sterling money, and the other with current"
      - "repentance."
    m:
      - "Quiet, please. *(to FALSTAFF)* Pay her what you owe her, and undo the wrongdoings you’ve done to her. You can do the first with money, and the second with a sincere apology."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without reply. You call"
      - "honorable boldness “impudent sauciness.” If a man will"
      - "make curtsy and say nothing, he is virtuous. No, my lord, my"
      - "humble duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say to"
      - "you, I do desire deliverance from these officers, being upon"
      - "hasty employment in the King’s affairs."
    m:
      - "Sir, I will not put up with this snub without a reply. You call my brave, honorable dealings insolent disrespect. Does a man have to stand here, silent and bowing, to be a virtuous man? No, sir. With all due respect, I won’t bow down to you. I say that I want to be set free by these officers, seeing as I have urgent work to do for the King."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "You speak as having power to do wrong; but answer in th’"
      - "effect of your reputation, and satisfy this poor woman."
    m:
      - "You talk as though you have permission to break the law. But act appropriately to your status: satisfy this poor woman."

    m:

  - sp: GOWER
    o:

      - "Are near at hand. The rest the paper tells."
    m:

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:

    m:
      - "On my honor."

  - sp: MISTRESS QUICKLY
    o:

    m:

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Glasses, glasses, is the only drinking. And for thy walls, a"
      - "pretty slight drollery, or the story of the Prodigal or the"
      - "German hunting in waterwork is worth a thousand of these"
      - "bed-hangers and these fly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten"
      - "pound, if thou canst. Come, an ’twere not for thy humors,"
      - "there’s not a better wench in England. Go wash thy face, and"
      - "draw the action. Come, thou must not be in this humor with"
      - "me. Dost not know me? Come, come, I know thou wast set"
      - "on to this."
    m:
      - "It’s not such a big deal. Glass is the only good thing to drink out of anyway. And as for the walls, something pretty and comical—or a depiction of the prodigal son; or maybe one of those German hunting scenes, painted on the wall to look like a tapestry—why, those are worth a thousand of those bed curtains and moth-eaten tapestries. Let me borrow just ten pounds, all right? Come on—other than your moodiness, you’re the best wench in England. Go wash your face and withdraw the lawsuit. Come on—don’t be this way with me. Don’t you know me? Come, come, I know somebody put you up to this."

  - sp: MISTRESS QUICKLY
    o:

      - "loath to pawn my plate, so God save me, la."
    m:
      - "Please, Sir John, let’s call it twenty nobles. I don’t want to have to pawn my china, in God’s name!"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Let it alone. I’ll make other shift. You’ll be a fool still."
    m:
      - "All right, forget it. I’ll figure something else out. You’ll always be a fool."

  - sp: MISTRESS QUICKLY
    o:
      - "Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown. I hope"
      - "you’ll come to supper. You’ll pay me all together?"
    m:
      - "All right, I’ll lend it to you, even if I have to pawn my clothes. I hope you’ll have dinner here tonight. You’ll pay me the full amount then?"
