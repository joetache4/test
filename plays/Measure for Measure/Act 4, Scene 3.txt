      - "customers. First, here’s young Master Rash; he’s in"
      - "for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,"
      - "ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made"
      - "five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not"
      - "much in request, for the old women were all dead."
      - "Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of"
      - "Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of"

      - "I’ve got as many friends here as I did back at the brothel. You’d think it were Mistress Overdone’s very own house, so many of her old customers are here. First, here’s young Mister Hasty; he’s in for debt, having paid 197 pounds for some coarse brown paper and old ginger candy, and making back only three pounds selling it. Ginger wasn’t much in demand, because the old ladies were all dead. Then there’s one Mister Pirouette, defendant in a suit about four suits, brought by Mister Thick Velvet, the textile merchant. He’s being impeached over peach-colored satin. Then we’ve also got young Ditsy, and young Mister Cross-My-Heart, and Mister Cubic Zirconia and Mister Cheapskate, armed to fight duels, and young Kill-Heir who murdered robust Stuffed-Guts, and Mister Forward-Thrust the fighter, and dressed-to-kill Mister Shoe-Buckle, the world-traveler, and wild Half-Pint who stabbed Pots, and, I think, forty more gents—all great clients of our business, who now sing that old prison refrain, “Give us food for the Lord’s sake.”"

      - "If he were known alive?"
    m:
      - "We’ll do it, good father, immediately. But Barnardine must die this afternoon. And what do we do with Claudio, to save me from the danger of word getting out that he’s alive?"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Let this be done."
      - "Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:"

      - "By cold gradation and well-balanced form,"
      - "We shall proceed with Angelo."
    m:
      - "Now I’ll write letters to Angelo. The provost can deliver them. They’ll say I’m close to home and it’s of the utmost importance that I make a big public entrance. I’ll ask him to meet me at the holy springs three miles out of town. And from there, step by cool step, and observing all the proper procedures, I’ll deal with Angelo."

      - "When it is least expected."
    m:
      - "That’s Isabel’s voice. She’s here to see if her brother’s pardon has come yet. But I’ll hide the news for her own good, to turn her despair into divine comfort when she least expects it."

      - "Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,"
      - "There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom"
      - "In that good path that I would wish it go,"

      - "And general honour."
    m:
      - "This neither hurts him nor helps you a bit. Control yourself and leave your case to heaven. Pay attention to what I say. Every syllable is truth you can rely on. The duke’s coming home tomorrow—no, dry your eyes. His confessor, who belongs to our monastery, gave me this information. He’s already sent word to Escalus and Angelo, who are preparing to meet him at the gates and surrender their authority to him there. If you can, steer your mind along the path I want it to follow. You’ll have your desire inflicted on this wretch, the favor of the duke, revenge to your heart’s content, and general acclaim."

      - "With a light heart; trust not my holy order,"
      - "If I pervert your course. Who’s here?"
    m:
      - "Then give this letter to Friar Peter. It’s the one he sent me about the duke’s return. It’ll be a sign that I want to meet him at Mariana’s house tonight. I’ll tell him all about her case and yours, and he’ll bring you before the duke, and you can thoroughly accuse Angelo face-to-face. My poor self is bound by a sacred vow, so I won’t be there. *(giving the letter)* Go with this letter. Banish those worried tears with a light heart. Never trust my holy order again if I steer you wrong. Who’s here?"

      - "at home, he had lived."
    m:
      - "Oh, pretty Isabella, I’m sick at heart to see your eyes so red, but try to calm down. I have to dine on plain bread and water—to control my desire, I don’t fill my belly, since one big meal would get me excited. But they say the duke will be here tomorrow. I swear, Isabel, I loved your brother. If the good old whimsical duke, who loved to fool around in dark places, had been at home, Claudio would’ve lived."

    m:
