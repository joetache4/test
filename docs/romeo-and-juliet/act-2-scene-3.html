<p>The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,</p>
<p>Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,</p>
<p>And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels</p>
<p>From forth day’s path and Titan’s fiery wheels.</p>
<p>Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,</p>
<p>The day to cheer and night’s dank dew to dry,</p>
<p>I must upfill this osier cage of ours</p>
<p>With baleful weeds and precious-juicèd flowers.</p>
<p>The earth, that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb.</p>
<p>What is her burying, grave that is her womb.</p>
<p>And from her womb children of divers kind</p>
<p>We sucking on her natural bosom find,</p>
<p>Many for many virtues excellent,</p>
<p>None but for some and yet all different.</p>
<p>Oh, mickle is the powerful grace that lies</p>
<p>In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities.</p>
<p>For naught so vile that on the earth doth live</p>
<p>But to the earth some special good doth give.</p>
<p>Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use</p>
<p>Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.</p>
<p>Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,</p>
<p>And vice sometime by action dignified.</p>

<b>FRIAR LAWRENCE</b>
<p>The smiling morning is replacing the frowning night. Darkness is stumbling out of the sun’s path like a drunk man. Now, before the sun comes up and burns away the dew, I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers. The Earth is nature’s mother and also nature’s tomb. Plants are born out of the Earth, and they are buried in the Earth when they die. From the Earth’s womb, many different sorts of plants and animals come forth, and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment. Evertything nature creates has some special property, and each one is different. Herbs, plants, and stones possess great power. There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality. And there is nothing that does not turn bad if it’s put to the wrong use and abused. Virtue turns to vice if it’s misused. Vice sometimes becomes virtue through the right activity.</p>

<p>Inside the little rind of this weak flower, there is both poison and powerful medicine. If you smell it, you feel good all over your body. But if you taste it, you die. There are two opposite elements in everything, in men as well as in herbs—good and evil. When evil is dominant, death soon kills the body like cancer.</p>

<p>What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?</p>
<p>Young son, it argues a distempered head</p>
<p>So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.</p>
<p>Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,</p>

<p>But where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain</p>
<p>Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.</p>

<p>Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.</p>

<b>FRIAR LAWRENCE</b>
<p>God bless you. Who greets me so early in the morning? Young man, something’s wrong if you’re getting out of bed this early. Every old man has worries, and worried men never get any sleep, but young men shouldn’t have a care in the world. They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep. Therefore, the fact that you’re awake this early tells me you’ve been upset with some anxiety. If that’s not the case, then this must be the answer: You, Romeo, have not been to bed tonight.</p>

<p>Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!</p>
<p>Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,</p>
<p>So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies</p>
<p>Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.</p>
<p>Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine</p>
<p>Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!</p>
<p>How much salt water thrown away in waste</p>
<p>To season love that of it doth not taste!</p>
<p>The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,</p>
<p>Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears.</p>
<p>Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit</p>
<p>Of an old tear that is not washed off yet.</p>
<p>If e’er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,</p>
<p>Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.</p>
<p>And art thou changed? Pronounce this sentence then:</p>
<p>Women may fall when there’s no strength in men.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>FRIAR LAWRENCE</b>
<p>Holy Saint Francis, this is a drastic change! Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline, whom you loved so much? Then young men love with their eyes, not with their hearts. Jesus and Mary, how many tears did you cry for Rosaline? How many salty tear-drops did you waste salting a love you never tasted? The sun hasn’t yet melted away the fog you made with all your sighs. The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears. There’s still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn’t been washed off yet. If you were ever yourself, and this sadness was yours, you and your sadness were all for Rosaline. And now you’ve changed? Then repeat this after me: you can’t expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable.</p>
