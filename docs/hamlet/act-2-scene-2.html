<p>Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.</p>
<p>Moreover that we much did long to see you,</p>
<p>The need we have to use you did provoke</p>
<p>Our hasty sending. Something have you heard</p>
<p>Of Hamlet’s “transformation”—so call it</p>
<p>Since nor th’ exterior nor the inward man</p>
<p>Resembles that it was. What it should be,</p>
<p>More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him</p>
<p>So much from th’ understanding of himself,</p>
<p>I cannot dream of. I entreat you both</p>
<p>That, being of so young days brought up with him</p>
<p>And since so neighbored to his youth and ’havior,</p>
<p>That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court</p>
<p>Some little time so by your companies</p>
<p>To draw him on to pleasures and to gather,</p>
<p>So much as from occasion you may glean,</p>
<p>Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus</p>
<p>That, opened, lies within our remedy.</p>

<b>CLAUDIUS</b>
<p>Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. I’ve wanted to see you for a long time now, but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away. You’ve probably heard about the “change” that’s come over Hamlet—that’s the only word for it, since inside and out he’s different from what he was before. I can’t imagine what’s made him so unlike himself, other than his father’s death. Since you both grew up with him and are so familiar with his personality and behavior, I’m asking you to stay a while at court and spend some time with him. See if you can get Hamlet to have some fun, and find out if there’s anything in particular that’s bothering him, so we can set about trying to fix it.</p>

<p>Most fair return of greetings and desires.</p>

<p>Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine</p>
<p>Makes vow before his uncle never more</p>
<p>To give th’ assay of arms against your majesty.</p>
<p>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,</p>
<p>Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee</p>
<p>And his commission to employ those soldiers,</p>
<p>So levied as before, against the Polack,</p>
<p>With an entreaty, herein further shown,</p>
<p>That it might please you to give quiet pass</p>

<b>VOLTEMAND</b>
<p>Greetings to you too, your Highness. As soon as we raised the matter, the king sent out messengers to stop his nephew’s war preparations, which he originally thought were directed against Poland but learned on closer examination were directed against you. He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him, and he ordered Fortinbras’ arrest. Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again. The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand crowns and permission to lead his soldiers into Poland, asking you officially in this letter to allow his troops to pass through your kingdom on their way to Poland. He’s assuring you of your safety. <em>(he gives CLAUDIUS a document)</em></p>

<p>Well, that turned out well in the end. Sir and madam, to make grand speeches about what majesty is, what service is, or why day is day, night is night, and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day, night, and time. Therefore, since the essence of wisdom is not talking too much, I’ll get right to the point here. Your son is crazy. “Crazy” I’m calling it, since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it’s craziness? But that’s another story.</p>

<b>POLONIUS</b>
<p>Madam, I’m doing nothing but sticking to the point. It’s true he’s crazy, and it’s a shame it’s true, and it’s truly a shame he’s crazy—but now I sound foolish, so I’ll get right to the point. Now, if we agree Hamlet’s crazy, then the next step is to figure out the cause of this effect of craziness, or I suppose I should say the cause of this defect, since this defective effect is caused by something. This is what we must do, and that’s exactly what needs to be done. Think about it. I have a daughter (I have her until she gets married) who’s given me this letter, considering it her duty. Listen and think about this: <em>(he reads a letter)</em> “To the heavenly idol of my soul, the most beautified Ophelia”—By the way, “beautified” sounds bad, it sounds awful, it sounds crude, it’s a terrible use of the word. But I’ll go on: <em>(he reads the letter)</em> “In her excellent white bosom,” et cetera, et cetera—you don’t need to hear all this stuff—</p>

And so I said to my daughter: “Lord Hamlet is a prince, he’s out of your league. You have to end this.” And then I gave her orders to stay away from him, and not to accept any messages or little gifts from him. She did what I said. When she rejected Hamlet, he became sad, and stopped eating, stopped sleeping, got weak, got dizzy, and as a result lost his mind. And that’s why he’s crazy now, and all of us feel sorry for him.</p>

<p>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted. Or, if it was, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million. ’Twas caviary to the general. But it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido and thereabout of it, especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line—Let me see, let me see—</p>
<p><em>The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast</em>—</p>
<p>It is not so. It begins with Pyrrhus—</p>
<p><em>The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms</em>,</p>
<p><em>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</em></p>
<p><em>When he lay couchèd in the ominous horse</em>,</p>
<p><em>Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared</em></p>
<p><em>With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot</em></p>
<p><em>Now is he total gules, horridly tricked</em></p>
<p><em>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons</em>,</p>
<p><em>Baked and impasted with the parching streets</em>,</p>
<p><em>That lend a tyrannous and damnèd light</em></p>
<p><em>To their lord’s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire</em>,</p>
<p><em>And thus o’ersizèd with coagulate gore</em>,</p>
<p><em>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</em></p>
<p><em>Old grandsire Priam seeks</em>.</p>
<p>So, proceed you.</p>

<p>I heard you recite a speech for me once that was never acted out, or if it was, it was performed only once, since the play was not popular—like caviar for a slob who couldn’t appreciate it. But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play, with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy. I remember one critic said there was no vulgar language to spice up the dialogue, and showing off on playwright’s part. That critic called it an excellent play, containing things to reflect upon as well as sweet music to enjoy. I loved one speech in particular. It was when Aeneas told Dido about Priam’s murder. If you happen to remember this scene, begin at line—let me see, how does it go?</p>
<p><em>The ruggedPyrrhus,strong as a tiger—</em></p>
<p>No, that’s wrong; it begins like this:</p>
<p><em>Savage Pyrrhus, whose black armor was</em></p>
<p><em>As dark plans, and was like the night</em></p>
<p><em>When he crouched inside the Trojan Horse</em>,</p>
<p><em>Has now smeared his dark armor</em></p>
<p><em>With something worse. From head to foot</em></p>
<p><em>He’s now covered in red, decorated horribly</em></p>
<p><em>With the blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons</em>.</p>
<p><em>The blood is baked to a paste by fires he set in the streets</em>,</p>
<p><em>Fires that lend a terrible light to his horrible murders</em>.</p>
<p><em>Boiling with anger and fire</em>,</p>
<p><em>And coated thick with hard-baked blood</em>,</p>
<p><em>His eyes glowing like rubies, the hellish Pyrrhus</em></p>
<p><em>Goes looking for grandfather Priam</em>.</p>

<p>Now I am alone.</p>
<p>Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</p>
<p>Is it not monstrous that this player here,</p>
<p>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</p>
<p>Could force his soul so to his own conceit</p>
<p>That from her working all his visage wanned,</p>
<p>Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,</p>
<p>A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</p>
<p>With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing—</p>
<p>For Hecuba!</p>
<p>What’s Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba</p>
<p>That he should weep for her? What would he do</p>
<p>Had he the motive and the cue for passion</p>
<p>That I have? He would drown the stage with tears</p>
<p>And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,</p>
<p>Make mad the guilty and appall the free,</p>
<p>Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed</p>
<p>The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,</p>
<p>A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak</p>
<p>Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,</p>
<p>And can say nothing—no, not for a king,</p>
<p>Upon whose property and most dear life</p>
<p>A damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?</p>
<p>Who calls me “villain”? Breaks my pate across?</p>
<p>Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?</p>
<p>Tweaks me by the nose? Gives me the lie i’ th’ throat</p>
<p>As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>’Swounds, I should take it, for it cannot be</p>
<p>But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall</p>
<p>To make oppression bitter, or ere this</p>
<p>I should have fatted all the region kites</p>
<p>With this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!</p>
<p>Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!</p>
<p>O vengeance!</p>
<p>Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,</p>
<p>That I, the son of a dear father murdered,</p>
<p>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,</p>
<p>Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words</p>
<p>And fall a-cursing like a very drab,</p>
<p>A scullion! Fie upon ’t, foh!</p>
<p>About, my brain.—Hum, I have heard</p>
<p>That guilty creatures sitting at a play</p>
<p>Have, by the very cunning of the scene,</p>
<p>Been struck so to the soul that presently</p>
<p>They have proclaimed their malefactions.</p>
<p>For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak</p>
<p>With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players</p>
<p>Play something like the murder of my father</p>
<p>Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks.</p>
<p>I’ll tent him to the quick. If he do blench,</p>
<p>I know my course. The spirit that I have seen</p>
<p>May be the devil, and the devil hath power</p>
<p>T’ assume a pleasing shape. Yea, and perhaps</p>
<p>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</p>
<p>As he is very potent with such spirits,</p>
<p>Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds</p>
<p>More relative than this. The play’s the thing</p>
<p>Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.</p>

<p>Now I’m alone. Oh, what a mean low-life I am! It’s awful that this actor could force his soul to feel made-up feelings in a work of make-believe. He grew pale, shed real tears, became overwhelmed, his voice breaking with feeling and his whole being, even, meeting the needs of his act—and all for nothing. For Hecuba! What is Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, that he would weep for her? Just imagine what he would do if he had the cause for feeling that I do. He would drown the stage with his tears and burst the audience’s ears with his terrible words, drive the guilty spectators crazy, terrify the innocent ones, confuse the ignorant ones, and astound absolutely everyone’s eyes and ears. But what do I, a grim and uncourageous rascal, do? Mope around like a dreamer, not even bothering with plans for revenge, and I can say nothing—nothing at all—on behalf of a king whose dear life was stolen. Am I a coward? Is there anyone out there who’ll call me “villain” and slap me hard? Pull off my beard? Pinch my nose? Call me the worst liar? By God, if someone would do that to me, I’d take it, because I’m a lily-livered man—otherwise, I would’ve fattened up the local vultures with the intestines of that low-life king a long time ago. Bloody, inhuman villain! Remorseless, treacherous, sex-obsessed, unnatural villain! Ah, revenge! What an ass I am. I’m so damn brave. My dear father’s been murdered, and I’ve been urged to seek revenge by heaven and hell, and yet all I can do is stand around cursing like a whore in the streets. Damn it! I need to get myself together here! Hmm…. I’ve heard that guilty people watching a play have been so affected by the artistry of the scene that they are driven to confess their crimes out loud. Murder has no tongue, but miraculously it still finds a way to speak. I’ll have these actors perform something like my father’s murder in front of my uncle. I’ll watch my uncle. I’ll probe his conscience and see if he flinches. If he becomes pale, I know what to do. The ghost I saw may be the devil, and the devil has the power to assume a pleasing disguise, and so he may be taking advantage of my weakness and sadness to bring about my damnation. I need better evidence than the ghost to work with. The play’s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king.</p>
