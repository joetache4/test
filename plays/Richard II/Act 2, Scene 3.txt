  - os: "Wilds in Gloucestershire."
    ms: "In the woods in Gloucestershire."

  - os: "Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND, with Forces"
    ms: "HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND enter with an army."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?"
    m:
      - "How much farther is it to Berkeley, my lord?"

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "Believe me, noble lord,"
      - "I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:"
      - "These high wild hills and rough uneven ways"
      - "Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,"
      - "And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,"
      - "Making the hard way sweet and delectable."
      - "But I bethink me what a weary way"
      - "From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found"
      - "In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,"
      - "Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled"
      - "The tediousness and process of my travel:"
      - "But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have"
      - "The present benefit which I possess;"
      - "And hope to joy is little less in joy"
      - "Than hope enjoy’d: by this the weary lords"
      - "Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done"
      - "By sight of what I have, your noble company."
    m:
      - "Believe me, my noble lord, I’m a stranger to these parts. These high and wild hills go on for miles and are tiring. And yet your good conversation has been like sugar, making the difficult journey sweeter. But I think it will be a long and hard journey from Ravenspurgh to Cotswold for Ross and Willoughby since they won’t have your company, which has made my trip easier. But their trip will be made more enjoyable by the expectation that you’ll go with them next time. In this way, the journey for those tired lords will seem shorter. That’s what has happened to me. My journey has seemed shorter because you’ve been with me."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Of much less value is my company"
      - "Than your good words. But who comes here?"
    m:
      - "My companionship isn’t nearly as valuable as your kind words. Who’s coming?"

  - os: "Enter HENRY PERCY"
    ms: "HENRY PERCY enters."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "It is my son, young Harry Percy,"
      - "Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever."
      - "Harry, how fares your uncle?"
    m:
      - "It’s my son, young Harry Percy. He was sent by my brother Worcester, wherever he may be. Harry, how is your uncle Worcester?"

  - sp: HENRY PERCY
    o:
      - "I had thought, my lord, to have learn’d his health of you."
    m:
      - "I was thinking, my lord, that you would tell me that."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "Why, is he not with the queen?"
    m:
      - "Is he not with the queen?"

  - sp: HENRY PERCY
    o:
      - "No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,"
      - "Broken his staff of office and dispersed"
      - "The household of the king."
    m:
      - "No, my good lord. He has abandoned the court. He broke his staff and let the king’s servants go."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "What was his reason?"
      - "He was not so resolved when last we spake together."
    m:
      - "What was his reason? The last time we were together he hadn’t decided to do that."

  - sp: HENRY PERCY
    o:
      - "Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor."
      - "But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,"
      - "To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,"
      - "And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover"
      - "What power the Duke of York had levied there;"
      - "Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh."
    m:
      - "He did it because you were proclaimed a traitor. But, my lord, he’s gone now to Ravenspurgh, to help the Duke of Hereford, and he sent me to Berkeley to discover how large an army the Duke of York had there. Then he gave me orders to go on to Ravenspurgh."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?"
    m:
      - "Have you forgotten who the Duke of Hereford is, boy?"

  - sp: HENRY PERCY
    o:
      - "No, my good lord, for that is not forgot"
      - "Which ne’er I did remember: to my knowledge,"
      - "I never in my life did look on him."
    m:
      - "No, my good lord, because I can’t forget something I never remembered. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him in my life."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "Then learn to know him now; this is the duke."
    m:
      - "Then meet him now. This is the duke."

  - sp: HENRY PERCY
    o:
      - "My gracious lord, I tender you my service,"
      - "Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:"
      - "Which elder days shall ripen and confirm"
      - "To more approved service and desert."
    m:
      - "My gracious lord, I am in your service. I am young, but as I get older, I will demonstrate more impressive abilities."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure"
      - "I count myself in nothing else so happy"
      - "As in a soul remembering my good friends;"
      - "And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,"
      - "It shall be still thy true love’s recompense:"
      - "My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it."
    m:
      - "Thank you, kind Percy. I count myself happiest when remembering my good friends. I know that the reward for your love will be to witness how it helps me find greater success. My heart makes this promise to you, and this handshake seals that promise."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir"
      - "Keeps good old York there with his men of war?"
    m:
      - "How far is it to Berkeley? And what events keep good old York there with his soldiers?"

  - sp: HENRY PERCY
    o:
      - "There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,"
      - "Mann’d with three hundred men, as I have heard;"
      - "And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;"
      - "None else of name and noble estimate."
    m:
      - "There’s the castle, over by that group of trees. I’ve heard that it’s protected by three hundred men, and that the Lord of York, the Lord of Berkeley, and the Lord of Seymour are there. There’s no one else of title and noble reputation inside."

  - os: "Enter LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY"
    ms: "LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY enter."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,"
      - "Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste."
    m:
      - "Here come the Lord of Ross and the Lord of Willoughby. They are bloody from sticking their spurs so hard into their horses, and their faces are red from riding here so fast."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues"
      - "A banish’d traitor: all my treasury"
      - "Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich’d"
      - "Shall be your love and labour’s recompense."
    m:
      - "Welcome, my lords. I know that you’ve followed me here out of love for me. Right now I can only pay you with my thanks, but once I have money I’ll repay your love and hard work."

  - sp: LORD ROSS
    o:
      - "Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord."
    m:
      - "We are rich enough from just being here with you here, most noble lord."

  - sp: LORD WILLOUGHBY
    o:
      - "And far surmounts our labour to attain it."
    m:
      - "And that richness is much more than anything we could earn by working."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;"
      - "Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,"
      - "Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?"
    m:
      - "The poor earn their wealth in the form of gratitude. Until my young fortune matures, that gratitude will have to take the place of riches. But who’s coming now?"

  - os: "Enter LORD BERKELEY"
    ms: "LORD BERKELEY enters."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess."
    m:
      - "I think it’s the Lord of Berkeley."

  - sp: LORD BERKELEY
    o:
      - "My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you."
    m:
      - "Lord of Hereford, I have a message for you."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "My lord, my answer is—to Lancaster;"
      - "And I am come to seek that name in England;"
      - "And I must find that title in your tongue,"
      - "Before I make reply to aught you say."
    m:
      - "My lord, I will answer only to my proper name, the Duke of Lancaster. And I have come to claim that name here in England. I must hear you call me that title before I respond to anything else you say."

  - sp: LORD BERKELEY
    o:
      - "Mistake me not, my lord; ’tis not my meaning"
      - "To raze one title of your honour out:"
      - "To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,"
      - "From the most gracious regent of this land,"
      - "The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on"
      - "To take advantage of the absent time"
      - "And fright our native peace with self-born arms."
    m:
      - "Don’t misunderstand, my lord. It’s not my intention to deny you your title. I’ve come to you, my lord—whatever title you want me to use—from the most gracious regent in this land, that is the Duke of York. I need to know what has led you to exploit the absence of our king and jeopardize the peace in this land with your armies."

  - os: "Enter DUKE OF YORK attended"
    ms: "The DUKE OF YORK and his assistants enter."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "I shall not need transport my words by you;"
      - "Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!"
    m:
      - "*(to Lord Berkeley)* I won’t have to pass my message through you. Here comes his grace in person. *(to the Duke of York)* My noble uncle!"

  - os: "Kneels"
    ms: "HENRY BOLINGBROKE kneels."

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,"
      - "Whose duty is deceiveable and false."
    m:
      - "I don’t want to see you kneeling. I know you don’t really honor me."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "My gracious uncle—"
    m:
      - "My gracious uncle—"

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "Tut, tut!"
      - "Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:"
      - "I am no traitor’s uncle; and that word “grace.”"
      - "In an ungracious mouth is but profane."
      - "Why have those banish’d and forbidden legs"
      - "Dared once to touch a dust of England’s ground?"
      - "But then more “why?” why have they dared to march"
      - "So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,"
      - "Frighting her pale-faced villages with war"
      - "And ostentation of despised arms?"
      - "Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?"
      - "Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,"
      - "And in my loyal bosom lies his power."
      - "Were I but now the lord of such hot youth"
      - "As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself"
      - "Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,"
      - "From forth the ranks of many thousand French,"
      - "O, then how quickly should this arm of mine."
      - "Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee"
      - "And minister correction to thy fault!"
    m:
      - "Tsk, tsk! Don’t call me grace, and don’t call me uncle. I am not the uncle of a traitor, and it’s obscene to use that word “grace” when everybody knows you’re ungracious. You were banished, so why have you come back to England? Why have you and your army marched miles across peaceful England, scaring villagers with threats of war and displays of hateful weapons? Have you come now because the king is away? Why, you foolish boy, don’t you know that the king has put me in charge while he’s away and that I am loyal to him? If I were still the strong young man who, with your father, John of Gaunt, rescued the king’s father from thousands of French soldiers, I would quickly smack you. But my arm is too weak and shaky to administer punishment in that way."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:"
      - "On what condition stands it and wherein?"
    m:
      - "My gracious uncle, why don’t you tell me exactly what I’ve done wrong?"

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "Even in condition of the worst degree,"
      - "In gross rebellion and detested treason:"
      - "Thou art a banish’d man, and here art come"
      - "Before the expiration of thy time,"
      - "In braving arms against thy sovereign."
    m:
      - "You’ve done the worst that you can: rebellion and treason. You are banished from this country and now you’ve returned before you are allowed to do so. And you’ve brought an army to fight against your king."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "As I was banish’d, I was banish’d Hereford;"
      - "But as I come, I come for Lancaster."
      - "And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace"
      - "Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:"
      - "You are my father, for methinks in you"
      - "I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,"
      - "Will you permit that I shall stand condemn’d"
      - "A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties"
      - "Pluck’d from my arms perforce and given away"
      - "To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?"
      - "If that my cousin king be King of England,"
      - "It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster."
      - "You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;"
      - "Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,"
      - "He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,"
      - "To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay."
      - "I am denied to sue my livery here,"
      - "And yet my letters-patents give me leave:"
      - "My father’s goods are all distrain’d and sold,"
      - "And these and all are all amiss employ’d."
      - "What would you have me do? I am a subject,"
      - "And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;"
      - "And therefore, personally I lay my claim"
      - "To my inheritance of free descent."
    m:
      - "I was banished as Hereford, but I return as Lancaster. And, noble uncle, I beg that you look at my missteps impartially. I think I see my father in you. Oh, then, my father, are you going to force me to be a wandering drifter forever, while what is rightfully mine is taken away by force and given to wasteful social climbers? Why was I born? If my cousin is allowed to be the King of England, then I must be allowed to be the Duke of Lancaster. You have a son, Aumerle, who is my noble cousin. Let’s say that you died, and he had been treated this way. His uncle Gaunt would have acted as a father to him and fought to correct the wrongs done against him. I’m not allowed to claim my inheritance, though I’m legally entitled to do so. My father’s possessions have all been wrongfully confiscated and sold. What do you think I should do? I am a subject of the King of England, aren’t I? I claim what is lawfully mine. Since I’m not allowed to have attorneys, I must claim my inheritance myself."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "The noble duke hath been too much abused."
    m:
      - "The noble duke has been abused very much."

  - sp: LORD ROSS
    o:
      - "It stands your grace upon to do him right."
    m:
      - "You owe it to him to treat him well."

  - sp: LORD WILLOUGHBY
    o:
      - "Base men by his endowments are made great."
    m:
      - "His money and property are making lowly men rich."

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "My lords of England, let me tell you this:"
      - "I have had feeling of my cousin’s wrongs"
      - "And laboured all I could to do him right;"
      - "But in this kind to come, in braving arms,"
      - "Be his own carver and cut out his way,"
      - "To find out right with wrong, it may not be;"
      - "And you that do abet him in this kind"
      - "Cherish rebellion and are rebels all."
    m:
      - "Listen, lords of England: I’ve known about the injustices done to my cousin, and I have done everything I could to correct them. But because of the way he’s returned to England, with an army and all these weapons, there’s nothing I can do. And you who are helping him are just lowly rebels."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "The noble duke hath sworn his coming is"
      - "But for his own; and for the right of that"
      - "We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;"
      - "And let him ne’er see joy that breaks that oath!"
    m:
      - "The noble duke has sworn he has come back to England only for his own sake and not for any other reason. We have all sworn to help him, and I hope anyone who breaks that promise never feels joy again."

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:"
      - "I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,"
      - "Because my power is weak and all ill left:"
      - "But if I could, by Him that gave me life,"
      - "I would attach you all and make you stoop"
      - "Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;"
      - "But since I cannot, be it known to you"
      - "I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;"
      - "Unless you please to enter in the castle"
      - "And there repose you for this night."
    m:
      - "Well, well, I see how this is going to go. I admit I can’t change it, because my army is weak. But if God would let me, I’d arrest you all and make you stoop down before our king. But since I can’t, I’m going to remain neutral. So, good luck to you. Or do you want to come sleep in the castle tonight?"

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "An offer, uncle, that we will accept:"
      - "But we must win your grace to go with us"
      - "To Bristol castle, which they say is held"
      - "By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,"
      - "The caterpillars of the commonwealth,"
      - "Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away."
    m:
      - "Yes, uncle, we do. But first we must convince you to go with us to Bristol Castle, which I’ve heard is being held by Bushy, Bagot, and their accomplices. They are devouring the kingdom like caterpillars, and I’ve sworn to eliminate them."

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "It may be I will go with you: but yet I’ll pause;"
      - "For I am loath to break our country’s laws."
      - "Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:"
      - "Things past redress are now with me past care."
    m:
      - "I might go with you, but let me think about it first. I hate to break our country’s laws. I look at you neither as a friend nor a foe, and I don’t care about people’s past misdeeds that can’t be fixed now."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
