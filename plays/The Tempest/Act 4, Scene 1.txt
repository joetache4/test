  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "*(to FERDINAND)* If I have too austerely punished you,"
      - "Your compensation makes amends, for I"
      - "Have given you here a third of mine own life—"
      - "Or that for which I live—who once again"
      - "I tender to thy hand. All thy vexations"
      - "Were but my trials of thy love and thou"
      - "Hast strangely stood the test. Here, afore heaven,"
      - "I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,"
      - "Do not smile at me that I boast of her,"
      - "For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise"
      - "And make it halt behind her."
    m:
      - "*(to FERDINAND)* If I’ve punished you too harshly, I’m ready to make it up to you now, since I’ve given you a third of my life—everything I live for—my daughter Miranda. I put her in your hands. All the trouble I put you through was to test your love for her, and you’ve passed the test remarkably well. As heaven is my witness, I give you this valuable gift. Oh Ferdinand, don’t smile at me for bragging about Miranda, for you’ll see soon enough that she outshines any praise of her."

  - sp: FERDINAND
    o:
      - "    I do believe it"
      - "Against an oracle."
    m:
      - "I’d believe it even if oracles told me differently."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "Then as my gift and thine own acquisition"
      - "Worthily purchased, take my daughter. But"
      - "If thou dost break her virgin knot before"
      - "All sanctimonious ceremonies may"
      - "With full and holy rite be ministered,"
      - "No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall"
      - "To make this contract grow, but barren hate,"
      - "Sour-eyed disdain, and discord shall bestrew"
      - "The union of your bed with weeds so loathly"
      - "That you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed,"
      - "As Hymen’s lamps shall light you."
    m:
      - "Then take my daughter, both as my gift to you and as something you have earned. But if you have sex with her before the marriage ceremony takes place, the heavens will not bless your relationship, but will overwhelm you with hate, contempt, and discord, and will poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it. So be careful, and make sure you respect the holy institution of marriage."

  - sp: FERDINAND
    o:
      - "    As I hope"
      - "For quiet days, fair issue, and long life,"
      - "With such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den,"
      - "The most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion,"
      - "Our worser genius can shall never melt"
      - "Mine honor into lust to take away"
      - "The edge of that day’s celebration"
      - "When I shall think, or Phoebus’ steeds are foundered,"
      - "Or night kept chained below."
    m:
      - "I want peace, good kids, and a long life. To protect the love I cherish, I won’t be tempted by any opportunity to forget my honor and give in to lust. I refuse to give up the joys of my wedding day, when I’ll be so eager for my first night of love that I’ll wonder whether evening will ever come."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    Fairly spoke."
      - "Sit then and talk with her. She is thine own.—"
      - "What, Ariel! My industrious servant, Ariel!"
    m:

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service"
      - "Did worthily perform, and I must use you"
      - "In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,"
      - "O’er whom I give thee power, here to this place."
      - "Incite them to quick motion, for I must"
      - "Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple"
      - "Some vanity of mine art. It is my promise,"
      - "And they expect it from me."
    m:
      - "You and your fellow spirits did your last assignment well, and now I need your help again. Go bring them all here; I give you power over them. Make them act quickly. I have to give this young couple here a small display of my magic powers. I’ve promised them I would, and they’re expecting it."

    m:
      - "Before you can say “Come” and “Go,” And breathe twice, and shout “So, so!” Each one of your servants will rush here,"

  - o:
      - "Will be here with mop and mow."
      - "Do you love me, master, no?"
    m:

      - "To th’ fire i’ th’ blood. Be more abstemious,"
      - "Or else, goodnight your vow."
    m:
      - "*(to FERDINAND)* Make sure you behave honorably. Don’t go too far with her. If you let yourself get stirred up, you’ll forget your promise of good behavior. Calm yourself down or you’ll forget your vow."

  - sp: FERDINAND
    o:

      - "The white cold virgin snow upon my heart"
      - "Abates the ardor of my liver."
    m:

    o:

      - "Now come, my Ariel! Bring a corollary,"
      - "Rather than want a spirit. Appear and pertly!—"
    m:

    m:
      - "I am the rainbow-bearing messenger sent by my mistress Juno—the Queen of the Sky. I have come to announce that Juno has asked you, Ceres, goddess of the fields and the earth, to leave your rich farms of wheat, rye, barley, oats, and peas, the hills where the sheep nibble, the furrows that April covers with flowers for nymphs to make crowns with. You must leave the groves where the disappointed bachelor lurks, rejected by his love, and the well-pruned vineyards, and the rocky seashore."

    m:
      - "Greetings to you, rainbow messenger, who never disobeys Juno, wife of Jupiter; with your golden wings you sprinkle dewdrops and refreshing showers on my flowers, and arch your colored bow over my wooded fields and grassy meadows, like a beautiful scarf to decorate my earth. Why has your queen, Juno, called me here to this grassy spot?"

    m:
      - "Don’t be afraid of her company. I met Venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on Paphos, in a carriage pulled by doves. They were planning to pull a mischievous trick on Ferdinand and Miranda, who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day. But their trick failed. Venus went home again, and her little son broke all his arrows, swearing he’ll never shoot them again, but play with birds like other little boys."

And just like the whole empty and ungrounded vision you’ve seen, with its towers topped with clouds, its gorgeous palaces, solemn temples, the world itself—and everyone living in it—which will dissolve just as this illusory pageant has dissolved, leaving not even a wisp of cloud behind. We are all made of dreams, and our life stretches from sleep before birth to sleep after death. Sir, I’m upset. Please put up with my weakness. My old brain is troubled. Don’t be disturbed by my illness. If you like, you can rest a while in my room. I’ll go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind."

      - "I told you, sir, they were totally drunk, so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces, and beating the ground for touching their feet—yet even when drunk, they kept their plan firmly in mind. Then I beat my drum, at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes, looking around for the source of my music. I enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins. In the end I left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room, with the stinking water covering them up to their chins."
