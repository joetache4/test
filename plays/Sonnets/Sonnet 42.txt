      - "That thou hast her it is not all my grief,"
      - "And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;"
      - "That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,"
      - "A loss in love that touches me more nearly."
      - "Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:"
      - "Thou dost love her because thou knowst I love her;"
      - "And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,"
      - "Suff’ring my friend for my sake to approve her."
      - "If I lose thee, my loss is my love’s gain,"
      - "And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;"
      - "Both find each other, and I lose both twain,"
      - "And both for my sake lay on me this cross."
      - "  But here’s the joy; my friend and I are one;"
      - "  Sweet flatt’ry! Then she loves but me alone."

      - "The fact that you now have my mistress isn’t the only reason I’m hurt, though it’s true that I loved her dearly. What makes me cry the most is that now she has you, a loss of love that hurts me even more. You two criminals in love, here’s how I’ll rationalize the pain you’ve caused me: You, friend, love her because you know I love her. And she loves you for the exact same reason, putting up with your praises and lovemaking for my sake, because she knows you’re my friend. If I lose you, it’s a win for my mistress. And if I lose her, you will have found what I’ve lost. Both of the people I love find each other, and I lose them both, and both cause me this pain. But here’s what makes me happy: My friend and I are one person. How gratifying!—It turns out my mistress loves only me."
