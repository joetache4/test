      - "Dear master, I can go no further. Oh, I die for food. Here lie"
      - "I down and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master."

      - "Dear master, I can’t go any farther. Oh, I’m dying of hunger. I’ll lie down here and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master."

      - "Why, how now, Adam? No greater heart in thee? Live a little, comfort a little, cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers. For my sake, be comfortable. Hold death awhile at the arm’s end. I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die. But if thou diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labor. Well said. Thou look’st cheerly, and I’ll be with thee quickly. Yet thou liest in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some shelter, and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live anything in this desert. Cheerly, good Adam."
    m:
      - "Hey, what’s this, Adam? No braver than this? Live a little, be comforted a little, cheer up a little. If I can find any animal in this wild forest, I’ll either be food for it or bring it as food for you. You’re not as close to death as you think you are. For my sake, make yourself comfortable; keep death at arm’s length for a while. I’ll be back soon, and if I haven’t brought you anything to eat, I will give you permission to die. But if you die before I return, you’ll have made a mockery of my efforts. There we go! You look happier already, and I’ll be back quickly. But you’re lying out in the cold. Come, I’ll carry you to shelter. And you won’t die for lack of dinner, if there’s anything at all to eat in this desert-like forest. Cheer up, good Adam."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
