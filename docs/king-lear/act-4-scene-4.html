<p>Alack, ’tis he. Why, he was met even now</p>
<p>As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud,</p>

<p>With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,</p>
<p>Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow</p>

<b>CORDELIA</b>
<p>Sadly, it’s the king that’s missing. They saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea, singing loudly, wearing a crown of nettles, thorns, hemlock, and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields.—Send out a hundred soldiers to find him. Search high and low, in every acre of the fields, and bring him here for me to see him.</p>

<b>CORDELIA</b>
<p>We already knew that. Our forces are ready for them. Oh, father, I’m taking care of your business. That’s why the King of France listened to my pleas and tears. We’re not invading England out of ambition or greed, but out of love—dear love!—and my father’s right to his kingdom. I hope I see him and hear him again soon.</p>
