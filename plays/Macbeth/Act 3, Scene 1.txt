    ms: "BANQUO enters."

  - sp: BANQUO
    o:
      - "Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,"
      - "As the weird women promised, and I fear"
      - "Thou played’st most foully for ’t. Yet it was said"
      - "It should not stand in thy posterity,"
      - "But that myself should be the root and father"
      - "Of many kings. If there come truth from them—"
      - "As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine—"
      - "Why, by the verities on thee made good,"
      - "May they not be my oracles as well,"
      - "And set me up in hope? But hush, no more."
    m:
      - "Now you have it all: you’re the king, the thane of Cawdor, and the thane of Glamis, just like the weird women promised you. And I suspect you cheated to win these titles. But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants, and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead. If the witches tell the truth—which they did about you—maybe what they said about me will come true too. But shhh! I’ll shut up now."

  - os: "Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, LORDS, LADIES, and attendants"
    ms: "A trumpet plays. MACBETH enters dressed as king, and LADY MACBETH enters dressed as queen, together with LENNOX, ROSS, LORDS, LADIES, and their attendants"

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "Here’s our chief guest."
    m:
      - "*(indicating BANQUO)* Here’s our most important guest."

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "If he had been forgotten,"
      - "It had been as a gap in our great feast,"
      - "And all-thing unbecoming."
    m:
      - "If we forgot him, our big celebration wouldn’t be complete, and that wouldn’t be any good."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,"
      - "And I’ll request your presence."
    m:
      - "*(to BANQUO)* Tonight we’re having a ceremonial banquet, and I want you to be there."

  - sp: BANQUO
    o:
      - "    Let your highness"
      - "Command upon me, to the which my duties"
      - "Are with a most indissoluble tie"
      - "Forever knit."
    m:
      - "Whatever your highness commands me to do, it is always my duty to do it."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "Ride you this afternoon?"
    m:
      - "Are you going riding this afternoon?"

  - sp: BANQUO
    o:
      - "Ay, my good lord."
    m:
      - "Yes, my good lord."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "We should have else desired your good advice—"
      - "Which still hath been both grave and prosperous—"
      - "In this day’s council, but we’ll take tomorrow."
      - "Is ’t far you ride?"
    m:
      - "We would have liked to have heard your good advice, which has always been serious and helpful, at the council today, but we’ll wait until tomorrow. Are you riding far?"

  - sp: BANQUO
    o:
      - "As far, my lord, as will fill up the time"
      - "’Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,"
      - "I must become a borrower of the night"
      - "For a dark hour or twain."
    m:
      - "I’m going far enough that I’ll be riding from now until dinner. Unless my horse goes faster than expected, I will be back an hour or two after sunset."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "    Fail not our feast."
    m:
      - "Don’t miss our feast."

  - sp: BANQUO
    o:
      - "My lord, I will not."
    m:
      - "My lord, I won’t miss it."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "We hear our bloody cousins are bestowed"
      - "In England and in Ireland, not confessing"
      - "Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers"
      - "With strange invention. But of that tomorrow,"
      - "When therewithal we shall have cause of state"
      - "Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse. Adieu,"
      - "Till your return at night. Goes Fleance with you?"
    m:
      - "We hear that the princes, those murderers, have hidden in England and Ireland. They haven’t confessed to cruelly murdering their own father, and they’ve been making up strange lies to tell their hosts. But we can talk more about that tomorrow, when we’ll discuss matters of state that concern us both. Hurry up and get to your horse. Good-bye, until you return tonight. Is Fleance going with you?"

  - sp: BANQUO
    o:
      - "Ay, my good lord. Our time does call upon ’s."
    m:
      - "Yes, my good lord. It’s time we hit the road."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "I wish your horses swift and sure of foot,"
      - "And so I do commend you to their backs."
      - "Farewell."
    m:
      - "I hope your horses are fast and surefooted. And with that, I send you to them. Farewell."

      - "Till suppertime alone. While then, God be with you!"
    m:
      - "Everybody may do as they please until seven o’clock tonight. In order to make your company even more enjoyable, I’m going to keep to myself until suppertime. Until then, God be with you!"

  - os: "Exeunt all except MACBETH and a SERVANT"
    ms: "Everyone exits except MACBETH and a SERVANT"

  - o:
      - "Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men"
      - "Our pleasure?"
    m:
      - "*(to the SERVANT)* You there, let me have a word with you. Are those men waiting for me?"

  - sp: SERVANT
    o:
      - "They are, my lord, without the palace gate."
    m:
      - "They’re waiting outside the palace gate, my lord."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "Bring them before us."
    m:
      - "Bring them to me."

  - os: "Exit SERVANT"
    ms: "The SERVANT exits."

  - o:
      - "To be thus is nothing,"
      - "But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo"
      - "Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature"
      - "Reigns that which would be feared. ’Tis much he dares,"
      - "And to that dauntless temper of his mind"
      - "He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor"
      - "To act in safety. There is none but he"
      - "Whose being I do fear, and under him"
      - "My genius is rebuked, as it is said"
      - "Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters"
      - "When first they put the name of king upon me"
      - "And bade them speak to him. Then, prophetlike,"
      - "They hailed him father to a line of kings."
      - "Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown"
      - "And put a barren scepter in my grip,"
      - "Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,"
      - "No son of mine succeeding. If ’t be so,"
      - "For Banquo’s issue have I filed my mind;"
      - "For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered;"
      - "Put rancors in the vessel of my peace"
      - "Only for them; and mine eternal jewel"
      - "Given to the common enemy of man,"
      - "To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!"
      - "Rather than so, come fate into the list,"
      - "And champion me to th’ utterance. Who’s there?"
    m:
      - "To be the king is nothing if I’m not safe as the king. I’m very afraid of Banquo. There’s something noble about him that makes me fear him. He’s willing to take risks, and his mind never stops working. He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely. I’m not afraid of anyone but him. Around him, my guardian angel is frightened, just as Mark Antony’s angel supposedly feared Octavius Caesar. Banquo chided the witches when they first called me king, asking them to tell him his own future. Then, like prophets, they named him the father to a line of kings. They gave me a crown and a scepter that I can’t pass on. Someone outside my family will take these things away from me, since no son of mine will take my place as king. If this is true, then I’ve tortured my conscience and murdered the gracious Duncan for Banquo’s sons. I’ve ruined my own peace for their benefit. I’ve handed over my everlasting soul to the devil so that they could be kings. Banquo’s sons, kings! Instead of watching that happen, I will challenge fate to battle and fight to the death. Who’s there!"

  - os: "Enter SERVANT and two MURDERERS"
    ms: "The SERVANT comes back in with two MURDERERS"

  - o:
      - "Now go to the door and stay there till we call."
    m:
      - "Now go to the door and stay there until I call for you."

  - os: "Exit SERVANT"
    ms: "The SERVANT exits."

  - o:
      - "Was it not yesterday we spoke together?"
    m:
      - "Wasn’t it just yesterday that we spoke to each other?"

  - sp: FIRST MURDERER
    o:
      - "It was, so please your highness."
    m:
      - "It was yesterday, your highness."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "    Well then, now"
      - "Have you considered of my speeches? Know"
      - "That it was he, in the times past, which held you"
      - "So under fortune, which you thought had been"
      - "Our innocent self. This I made good to you"
      - "In our last conference, passed in probation with you,"
      - "How you were borne in hand, how crossed, the instruments,"
      - "Who wrought with them, and all things else that might"
      - "To half a soul and to a notion crazed"
      - "Say, “Thus did Banquo.”"
    m:
      - "Well, did you think about what I said? You should know that it was Banquo who made your lives hell for so long, which you always thought was my fault. But I was innocent. I showed you the proof at our last meeting. I explained how you were deceived, how you were thwarted, the things that were used against you, who was working against you, and a lot of other things that would convince even a half-wit or a crazy person to say, “Banquo did it!”"

  - sp: FIRST MURDERER
    o:
      - "    You made it known to us."
    m:
      - "You explained it all."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "I did so, and went further, which is now"
      - "Our point of second meeting. Do you find"
      - "Your patience so predominant in your nature"
      - "That you can let this go? Are you so gospeled"
      - "To pray for this good man and for his issue,"
      - "Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave"
      - "And beggared yours forever?"
    m:
      - "I did that and more, which brings me to the point of this second meeting. Are you so patient and forgiving that you’re going to let him off the hook? Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children, a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever?"

  - sp: FIRST MURDERER
    o:
      - "    We are men, my liege."
    m:
      - "We are men, my lord."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men,"
      - "As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,"
      - "Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept"
      - "All by the name of dogs. The valued file"
      - "Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,"
      - "The housekeeper, the hunter, every one"
      - "According to the gift which bounteous nature"
      - "Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive"
      - "Particular addition, from the bill"
      - "That writes them all alike. And so of men."
      - "Now, if you have a station in the file,"
      - "Not i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say ’t,"
      - "And I will put that business in your bosoms,"
      - "Whose execution takes your enemy off,"
      - "Grapples you to the heart and love of us,"
      - "Who wear our health but sickly in his life,"
      - "Which in his death were perfect."
    m:
      - "Yes, you’re part of the species called men. Just as hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, mutts, shaggy lapdogs, swimming dogs, and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs. But if you list the different kinds of dogs according to their qualities, you can distinguish which breeds are fast or slow, which ones are clever, which ones are watchdogs, and which ones hunters. You can classify each dog according to the natural gifts that separate it from all other dogs. It’s the same with men. Now, if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn’t down at the very bottom, tell me. Because if that’s the case, I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me. As long as Banquo lives, I am sick. I’ll be healthy when he is dead."

  - sp: SECOND MURDERER
    o:
      - "    I am one, my liege,"
      - "Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world"
      - "Have so incensed that I am reckless what"
      - "I do to spite the world."
    m:
      - "My lord, I’ve been so kicked around by the world, and I’m so angry, that I don’t even care what I do."

  - sp: FIRST MURDERER
    o:
      - "And I another"
      - "So weary with disasters, tugged with fortune,"
      - "That I would set my life on any chance,"
      - "To mend it or be rid on ’t."
    m:
      - "I’m the same. I’m so sick of bad luck and trouble that I’d risk my life on any bet, as long as it would either fix my life or end it once and for all."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "    Both of you"
      - "Know Banquo was your enemy."
    m:
      - "You both know Banquo was your enemy."

  - sp: BOTH MURDERERS
    o:
      - "    True, my lord."
    m:
      - "It’s true, my lord."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "So is he mine; and in such bloody distance"
      - "That every minute of his being thrusts"
      - "Against my near’st of life. And though I could"
      - "With barefaced power sweep him from my sight"
      - "And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,"
      - "For certain friends that are both his and mine,"
      - "Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall"
      - "Who I myself struck down. And thence it is,"
      - "That I to your assistance do make love,"
      - "Masking the business from the common eye"
      - "For sundry weighty reasons."
    m:
      - "He’s my enemy too, and I hate him so much that every minute he’s alive it eats away at my heart. Since I’m king, I could simply use my power to get rid of him. But I can’t do that, because he and I have friends in common whom I need, so I have to be able to moan and cry over his death in public even though I’ll be the one who had him killed. That’s why I need your help right now. I have to hide my real plans from the public eye for many important reasons."

  - sp: SECOND MURDERER
    o:
      - "We shall, my lord,"
      - "Perform what you command us."
    m:
      - "We’ll do what you want us to, my lord."

    o:

    m:
      - "Though our lives—"

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most"
      - "I will advise you where to plant yourselves,"
      - "Acquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time,"
      - "The moment on ’t; for ’t must be done tonight,"
      - "And something from the palace; always thought"
      - "That I require a clearness. And with him—"
      - "To leave no rubs nor botches in the work—"
      - "Fleance, his son, that keeps him company,"
      - "Whose absence is no less material to me"
      - "Than is his father’s, must embrace the fate"
      - "Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart."
      - "I’ll come to you anon."
    m:
      - "*(interrupts him)* I can see the determination in your eyes. Within the next hour I’ll tell you where to go and exactly when to strike. It must be done tonight, away from the palace. Always remember that I must be free from suspicion. For the plan to work perfectly, you must kill both Banquo and his son, Fleance, who keeps him company. Getting rid of Fleance is as important to me as knocking off Banquo. Each of you should make up your own mind about whether you’re going to do this. I’ll come to you soon."

  - sp: BOTH MURDERERS
    o:
      - "We are resolved, my lord."
    m:
      - "We have decided, my lord. We’re in."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:

  - os: "Exeunt MURDERERS"
    ms: "The MURDERERS exit."

  - o:
      - "It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight,"
      - "If it find heaven, must find it out tonight."
    m:
      - "The deal is closed. Banquo, if your soul is going to make it to heaven, tonight’s the night."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."
