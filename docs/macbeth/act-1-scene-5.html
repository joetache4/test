<b>LADY MACBETH</b>
<p><em>(reading)</em> “They met me in the day of success, and I have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king, who all-hailed me ’Thane of Cawdor,’ by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time with ’Hail, king that shalt be!’ This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”</p>
<p>Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be</p>
<p>What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature;</p>
<p>It is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness</p>
<p>To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great,</p>
<p>Art not without ambition, but without</p>
<p>The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,</p>
<p>That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,</p>
<p>And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou’ld’st have, great Glamis,</p>
<p>That which cries, “Thus thou must do,” if thou have it,</p>
<p>And that which rather thou dost fear to do,</p>
<p>Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,</p>
<p>That I may pour my spirits in thine ear</p>
<p>And chastise with the valor of my tongue</p>
<p>All that impedes thee from the golden round,</p>
<p>Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem</p>
<p>To have thee crowned withal.</p>

<b>LADY MACBETH</b>
<p>“The witches met me on the day of my victory in battle, and I have since learned that they have supernatural knowledge. When I tried desperately to question them further, they vanished into thin air. While I stood spellbound, messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor, which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me ’the future king!’ I thought I should tell you this news, my dearest partner in greatness, so that you could rejoice along with me about the greatness that is promised to us. Keep it secret, and farewell.” <em>(she looks up from the letter)</em> You are thane of Glamis and Cawdor, and you’re going to be king, just like you were promised. But I worry about whether or not you have what it takes to seize the crown. You are too full of the milk of human kindness to strike aggressively at your first opportunity. You want to be powerful, and you don’t lack ambition, but you don’t have the mean streak that these things call for. The things you want to do, you want to do like a good man. You don’t want to cheat, yet you want what doesn’t belong to you. There’s something you want, but you’re afraid to do what you need to do to get it. You want it to be done for you. Hurry home so I can persuade you and talk you out of whatever’s keeping you from going after the crown. After all, fate and witchcraft both seem to want you to be king.</p>

Thicken my blood and clog up my veins so I won’t feel remorse, so that no human compassion can stop my evil plan or prevent me from accomplishing it! Come to my female breast and turn my mother’s milk into poisonous acid, you murdering demons, wherever you hide, invisible and waiting to do evil! Come, thick night, and cover the world in the darkest smoke of hell, so that my sharp knife can’t see the wound it cuts open, and so heaven can’t peep through the darkness and cry, “No! Stop!”</p>
