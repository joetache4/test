    o:
      - "In my chamber window lies a book. Bring it hither to me in"
      - "the orchard."
    m:
      - "In my bedroom window there is a book. Go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard."

  - sp: BOY
    o:
      - "I am here already, sir."
    m:
      - "I’m already here, sir."

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:

      - "I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another"
      - "man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love, will,"
      - "after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others,"
      - "become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love—"
      - "and such a man is Claudio. I have known when there was no"
      - "music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he"
      - "rather hear the tabor and the pipe. I have known when he"
      - "would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and"
      - "now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new"
      - "doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose,"
      - "like an honest man and a soldier, and now is he turned"
      - "orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just"
      - "so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with"
      - "these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not."
      - "I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster,"
      - "but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me,"
      - "he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet"
      - "I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous,"
      - "yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one"
      - "woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s"
      - "certain; wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen"
      - "her; fair, or I’ll ever look on her; mild, or come not near"
      - "me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an"
      - "excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what color it"
      - "please God. Ha! The Prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide"
      - "me in the arbor."
    m:
      - "I’m amazed that a man, after watching romance turn another man into a fool and laughing at that man, can turn right around and become the thing he’s scorned. That’s the kind of man Claudio is. I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe. I knew him when he would’ve walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket. He used to speak plainly and to the point, like an honorable man and soldier; now his speech is elaborate and flowery. His words are like a miraculous banquet, full of strange new dishes. Will I be changed like that, and see the world through a lover’s eyes? I’m not sure, but I don’t think so. I can’t promise that love won’t transform me, but I can promise you this: until I truly fall in love, a woman will never make me act like such a fool. A beautiful woman comes along, but I’m unmoved. A wise woman turns up, but I’m unmoved. A virtuous woman appears, but I’m unmoved. I refuse to fall in love until all three qualities unite in a single woman. She must be rich, certainly, and smart, or I’ll have nothing to do with her. She has to be virtuous, or I’ll never bid on her; beautiful, or I won’t bother to look at her. Mild-mannered, or else she should stay away from me. Noble, or I won’t have her even if she’s an angel. She must be well spoken, an excellent musician, and her hair should be—well, I suppose the color doesn’t matter. Ha! Look, it’s the Prince and Mr. Love. I’ll hide in the arbor."

    ms: "He hides."

  - os: "Enter DON PEDRO,CLAUDIO, and LEONATO, andBALTHASAR with music"
    ms: "DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO enter. BALTHASAR enters with music."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "Come, shall we hear this music?"
    m:
      - "Well, should we hear some music?"

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,"
      - "As hushed on purpose to grace harmony!"
    m:
      - "Yes, my lord. Listen to how quiet the evening is, as if it’s purposefully setting the stage for a song."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "*(aside to CLAUDIO)*"
      - "See you where Benedick hath hid himself?"
    m:
      - "*(speaking so that only CLAUDIOcan hear)* Do you see where Benedick is hiding?"

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "*(aside to DON PEDRO)*"
      - "O, very well, my lord. The music ended,"
      - "We’ll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth."
    m:
      - "*(speaking so that only DON PEDROcan hear)* Yes, very well, my lord. Once the music has ended, we’ll give him more than he bargained for."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "Come, Balthasar, we’ll hear that song again."
    m:
      - "Come on, Balthasar, let’s hear that song again."

  - sp: BALTHASAR
    o:
      - "O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice"
      - "To slander music anymore than once."
    m:
      - "Oh, my good lord, don’t make me insult music again with my awful singing."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "It is the witness still of excellency"
      - "To put a strange face on his own perfection."
      - "I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more."
    m:
      - "You can tell an artist is excellent when he denies his own perfection. Please, sing for us; don’t make me woo you anymore!"

  - sp: BALTHASAR
    o:
      - "Because you talk of wooing, I will sing,"
      - "Since many a wooer doth commence his suit"
      - "To her he thinks not worthy, yet he woos,"
      - "Yet will he swear he loves."
    m:
      - "Since you put it that way, I’ll sing. You’re like a suitor who courts a woman insincerely, swearing that he loves her even though he really doesn’t find her worthy."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "    Nay, pray thee, come,"
      - "Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,"
      - "Do it in notes."
    m:
      - "Come on, please sing. If you’d like to continue this discussion, at least do so with music."

  - sp: BALTHASAR
    o:
      - "  Note this before my notes:"
      - "There’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting."
    m:
      - "Just know this before I begin: I can’t play a single note that’s worthy of note."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks!"
      - "Note notes, forsooth, and nothing."
    m:
      - "Listen to him speaking in quarter notes! Get on with your note-playing now."

  - os: "Music plays"
    ms: "Music plays."

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:
      - "*(aside)* Now, divine air! Now is his soul ravished. Is it not"
      - "strange that sheeps’ guts should hale souls out of men’s"
      - "bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when all’s done."
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* That music must be divine, because their souls have been captivated. Isn’t it strange that strings made of sheep’s guts are capable of drawing men’s souls out of their bodies? Well, *I’d* rather listen to a plain old hunting horn than this music, when all is said and done."

  - sp: BALTHASAR
    o:

      - "  *Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more*,"

      - "  *The fraud of men was ever so*,"
      - "  *Since summer first was leavy*."
      - "  *Then sigh not so, but let them go*"
      - "  *And be you blithe and bonny*,"

      - "  *Don’t cry anymore, ladies, don’t cry anymore*"
      - "  *Men have always been deceivers*,"
      - "  *One foot on a ship and one on the shore*,"
      - "  *Never devoted to anything*."
      - "  *So don’t cry like that, just let them go*"
      - "  *And be happy and carefree forever*,"
      - "  *Turning all your sad sounds around*"
      - "  *When you sing “Hey, nonny nonny” instead*."
      - "  *Don’t sing more sad songs*"
      - "  *About being down in the dumps*"
      - "  *For men have been committing this kind of fraud*"
      - "  *Ever since the first summer trees had leaves*."
      - "  *So don’t cry like that, just let them go*"
      - "  *And be happy and carefree forever*,"

      - "By my troth, a good song."
    m:
      - "That’s a good song."

  - sp: BALTHASAR
    o:
      - "And an ill singer, my lord."
    m:
      - "And a bad singer, my lord."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "Ha, no, no, faith, thou sing’st well enough for a shift."
    m:
      - "Ha! No, no, really, your voice is good enough in a pinch."

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:
      - "*(aside)* An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,"
      - "they would have hanged him. And I pray God his bad voice"
      - "bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the night raven,"
      - "come what plague could have come after it."
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* If a dog had howled like that, I would have hung it. I hope his horrible singing doesn’t have any ill effects. I would’ve rather listened to the night raven screech, even if the bird’s noise does give me the plague, as they say it will."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee, get us"
      - "some excellent music, for tomorrow night we would have it"
      - "at the Lady Hero’s chamber window"
    m:
      - "Yes, do you hear me, Balthasar? Please, get some excellent music, because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom window."

  - sp: BALTHASAR
    o:
      - "The best I can, my lord."
    m:
      - "I’ll do the best I can, my lord."

  - o:
      - "Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of today,"
      - "that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signor Benedick?"
    m:
      - "Come here, Leonato. What was it that you told me today—that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?"

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "Oh, ay. *(aside to DON PEDRO)* Stalk on, stalk on; the fowl"
      - "sits.—I did never think that lady would have loved any"
      - "man."
    m:
      - "Oh yes. *(speaking so that only DON PEDRO can hear)* Go on, keep walking: our prey is in sight.—I never thought that woman would love any man."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "No, nor I neither, but most wonderful that she should so"
      - "dote on Signor Benedick, whom she hath in all outward"
      - "behaviors seemed ever to abhor."
    m:
      - "I didn’t, either. But how wonderful that she should be so fond of Signior Benedick, whom she has always appeared to hate."

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:
      - "*(aside)* Is ’t possible? Sits the wind in that corner?"
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* Is it possible? Is that the way the wind is blowing?"

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it, but"
      - "that she loves him with an enraged affection, it is past the"
      - "infinite of thought."
    m:
      - "Really, my lord, I don’t know what to make of it, but she loves him with such a passion that it’s past all understanding."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "May be she doth but counterfeit."
    m:
      - "Maybe she’s just pretending."

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "Faith, like enough."
    m:
      - "Yes, that’s quite likely."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "O God! Counterfeit? There was never counterfeit of"
      - "passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it."
    m:
      - "Oh God! Pretending? No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this, then."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "Why, what effects of passion shows she?"
    m:
      - "Why, what symptoms of love does she exhibit?"

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "*(aside to LEONATO)* Bait the hook well; this fish will bite."
    m:
      - "*(speaking so that only LEONATOcan hear)* Bait the hook well; this fish is going to bite."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "What effects, my lord? She will sit you—you heard my"
      - "daughter tell you how."
    m:
      - "What symptoms, my lord? She will have a seat—you heard my daughter tell you how."

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "She did indeed."
    m:
      - "Yes, she did tell us."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "How, how I pray you? You amaze me. I would have thought"
      - "her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection."
    m:
      - "Please, please tell me! This is amazing. I would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "I would have sworn it had, my lord, especially against"
      - "Benedick."
    m:
      - "I would have sworn that, too, my lord, especially against Benedick."

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:
      - "*(aside)* I should think this a gull but that the white-bearded"
      - "fellow speaks it. Knavery cannot, sure, hide himself in such"
      - "reverence."
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* I would take this as a joke if the old man weren’t saying it. Mischief surely can’t be hiding in such a respectable man."

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "*(aside to DON PEDRO)* He hath ta’en th’ infection. Hold it up."
    m:
      - "*(speaking so that only DON PEDROcan hear)* We’ve infected him! Keep it up."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?"
    m:
      - "Has she told Benedick how she feels?"

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "No, and swears she never will. That’s her torment."
    m:
      - "No, and she swears she never will. That’s what’s driving her crazy."

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "’Tis true indeed, so your daughter says. “Shall I,” says she,"
      - "“that have so oft encountered him with scorn, write to him"
      - "that I love him?”"
    m:
      - "It’s true, Hero says so. Beatrice asks, “Does it make any sense to write and tell him I love him when I have always treated him with scorn?”"

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "This says she now when she is beginning to write to him, for"
      - "she’ll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her"
      - "smock till she have writ a sheet of paper. My daughter tells"
      - "us all."
    m:
      - "She says this as she begins to write the letter. She’ll be getting up twenty times in a night, sitting there in her slip until she’s written a page. My daughter told me everything."

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest"
      - "your daughter told."
    m:
      - "Now that you speak of paper, I remember a funny story of Hero’s."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "Oh, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she found"
      - "“Benedick” and “Beatrice” between the sheet?"
    m:
      - "Oh, you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it has “Benedick” and “Beatrice” written all over it?"

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "That."
    m:
      - "Yes, that’s the one."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence, railed at"
      - "herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that"
      - "she knew would flout her. “I measure him,” says she, “by"
      - "my own spirit, for I should flout him if he writ to me, yea,"
      - "though I love him, I should.”"
    m:
      - "Oh, she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her. “I compare him,” she says, “to myself, and I know that I would mock him if he wrote me such a letter. Yes, even though I love him, I would mock him.”"

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her"
      - "heart, tears her hair, prays, curses: “O sweet Benedick! God"
      - "give me patience!”"
    m:
      - "Then she falls down to her knees, weeps, sobs, beats her breast, tears her hair, prays, and curses: “Oh sweet Benedick! God give me patience!”"

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "She doth indeed, my daughter says so, and the ecstasy hath"
      - "so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime"
      - "afeared"
      - "she will do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true."
    m:
      - "She did indeed, my daughter says so. She worries that Beatrice is so overwrought that she might do herself harm someday. It’s true."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she"
      - "will not discover it."
    m:
      - "If she won’t tell Benedick, someone else should."

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "To what end? He would make but a sport of it and torment"
      - "the poor lady worse."
    m:
      - "And what would that accomplish? He’ll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She’s an"
      - "excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is"
      - "virtuous."
    m:
      - "If he did that, it would be a charitable deed to hang him. She’s an excellent, sweet woman, and there’s no doubt that she is virtuous."

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "And she is exceeding wise."
    m:
      - "And she is very smart."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "In every thing but in loving Benedick."
    m:
      - "Except for the fact that she loves Benedick."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "Oh, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a"
      - "body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory."
      - "I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and"
      - "her guardian."
    m:
      - "Oh, my lord, when wisdom and passion are in one body, it’s ten to one that the passion will win. I am sorry for her, as I should be, since I am both her uncle and her guardian."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "I would she had bestowed this dotage on me. I would have"
      - "daffed all other respects and made her half myself. I pray"
      - "you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say."
    m:
      - "I wish she were in love with me instead. I would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife. Please, tell Benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "Were it good, think you?"
    m:
      - "Is that a good idea, do you think?"

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she will die if he"
      - "love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known,"
      - "and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one"
      - "breath of her accustomed crossness."
    m:
      - "Hero thinks Beatrice will surely die, for she says she’ll die if he doesn’t love her, and that she’ll die before she tells him, and she’ll die if he woos her and she’s made to hold back even one of her usual insults."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "She doth well. If she should make tender of her love, ’tis"
      - "very possible he’ll scorn it, for the man, as you know all,"
      - "hath a contemptible spirit."
    m:
      - "She’s probably right. If she offers him her love, it’s very possible that he’ll scorn it, since, as we all know, he tends to be contemptuous."

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "He is a very proper man."
    m:
      - "He’s a very proper man."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "He hath indeed a good outward happiness."
    m:
      - "Indeed, he is good-looking and carries himself well."

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "Before God, and in my mind, very wise."
    m:
      - "And I swear to God he’s very smart."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit."
    m:
      - "He does indeed show sparks of something like wit."

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "And I take him to be valiant."
    m:
      - "And I believe him to be brave."

  - sp: DON PEDRO

The real fun will be when they both believe the other to be in love, without any of it being true. I can’t wait to watch that drama—it’ll be a pantomime, since both of them will be totally speechless! Let’s send Beatrice to call Benedick in to dinner"

      - "Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she’s a fair lady. I do spy"
      - "some marks of love in her."
    m:
      - "*(coming forward)* This can’t be a trick. They spoke with great seriousness, and they have Hero’s testimony. They seem to pity the lady. It seems her love is stretched to the limit. She loves me? Well, that love must be returned! I hear how I’m criticized. They say I’ll be smug if I find out she loves me. They also say she’d rather die than give any sign of her feelings. I never thought I’d marry. I can’t appear to be proud. People who discover their faults and can then change them are lucky indeed. They say the lady is beautiful; it’s true, I’ve seen it myself. And virtuous; that’s true, I can’t disprove that. And smart, except that she loves me. That may not be any proof of her intelligence, but I swear it won’t be evidence of her stupidity—for I’m going to be horribly in love with her! People might tease me here and there, since I attacked marriage for so long. But don’t tastes change? A man can love a dish when he is young that he hates when he turns old. Will quips and clever remarks and scathing written words keep a man from getting what his heart desires? No! The world needs to be populated. When I said that I’d die as a bachelor, I just meant that I didn’t think I’d live until I got married. Here comes Beatrice. By God! She’s a beautiful lady. I think I sense some signs of love in her."
