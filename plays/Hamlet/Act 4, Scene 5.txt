    o:
      - "I will not speak with her."
    m:
      - "I won’t speak to her."

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "    She is importunate,"
      - "Indeed distract. Her mood will needs be pitied."
    m:
      - "She’s insistent. In fact, she’s crazed. You can’t help feeling sorry for her."

  - sp: GERTRUDE
    o:
      - "What would she have?"
    m:
      - "What does she want?"

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "She speaks much of her father, says she hears"
      - "There’s tricks i’ th’ world, and hems, and beats her heart,"
      - "Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt"
      - "That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,"
      - "Yet the unshaped use of it doth move"
      - "The hearers to collection. They aim at it,"
      - "And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts,"
      - "Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,"
      - "Indeed would make one think there might be thought,"
      - "Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily."
    m:
      - "She talks about her father a lot, and says she hears there are conspiracies around the world, and coughs, and beats her breast, and gets angry over tiny matters, and talks nonsense. Her words don’t mean anything, but her babbling causes her listeners to draw conclusions. They hear what they want to hear. Her winks and nods and gestures do suggest that she means to convey a message, and not a happy one."

  - sp: HORATIO
    o:
      - "’Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew"
      - "Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds."
    m:
      - "It’s a good idea to speak to her, since she might lead those with evil intentions to dangerous conclusions."

      - "Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss."
      - "So full of artless jealousy is guilt,"
      - "It spills itself in fearing to be spilt."
    m:
      - "*(to herself)* To my sick soul (since sin is always a sickness), every detail looks like an omen of disaster to come. Guilt makes you so full of stupid suspicions that you give yourself away because you’re trying so hard not to."

      - "When sorrows come, they come not single spies"
      - "But in battalions. First, her father slain."
      - "Next, your son gone, and he most violent author"
      - "Of his own just remove. The people muddied,"
      - "Thick, and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers"
      - "For good Polonius’ death, and we have done but greenly"
      - "In hugger-mugger to inter him. Poor Ophelia"

      - "Gives me superfluous death."
    m:
      - "Oh, her grief has poisoned her mind. Her father died and now look at her! Oh, Gertrude, Gertrude, when bad things happen, they don’t come one at a time, like enemy spies, but all at once like an army. First her father was killed, then your son was taken away—because of his own violent actions. The people are confused and spreading nasty rumors about Polonius’ death, and I was a fool to bury him in a hurry, without a proper state funeral. Poor Ophelia has been robbed of her sanity, without which we’re just pictures, or animals. Last but not least, her brother has secretly returned from France and is surrounded by gossip-mongers, who fill his ears with wicked stories about his father’s death. Deprived of proper evidence, he’ll naturally attribute the murder to me. Oh, dear Gertrude, I feel as though I’m being murdered many times over."

    m:
      - "You must save yourself, my lord. The young Laertes, like the ocean when it floods the shore and devours the lowlands, is leading a rebellion against your government. The crowd calls him “lord” and shouts, “We want Laertes to be king!” It’s as if they were starting the world from scratch right now, throwing out the traditions and ancient customs that are the support of every word we utter. They throw their caps in the air and yell, “Laertes will be king! Laertes king!”"

Is it possible that a young woman’s mind could fade away as easily as an old man’s life? Human nature is refined and thoughtful—person graciously gives a valuable part of herself away to her beloved, as Ophelia has sent off her sanity to her dead father."

They say he looked good when he died. *(sings) For good sweet Robin is all my joy*."
