  - os: "Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO"
    ms: "SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO enter."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "I would not by my will have troubled you,"
      - "But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,"
      - "I will no further chide you."
    m:
      - "I really didn’t want to inconvenience you. But since you seem to enjoy helping me, I won’t nag you to stop any more."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "I could not stay behind you. My desire,"
      - "More sharp than filèd steel, did spur me forth."
      - "And not all love to see you, though so much"
      - "As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,"
      - "But jealousy what might befall your travel,"
      - "Being skilless in these parts, which to a stranger,"
      - "Unguided and unfriended, often prove"
      - "Rough and unhospitable. My willing love,"
      - "The rather by these arguments of fear,"
      - "Set forth in your pursuit."
    m:
      - "I couldn’t stay behind after you left. I just felt a sharp desire to follow you. It wasn’t just that I wanted to see you, though I very much did want that. I was also worried about what might happen to you while you were traveling, since you’re not familiar with this area, and it’s rough and unwelcoming to a stranger with no guide. I followed you because I love you and I was worried about you."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "  My kind Antonio,"
      - "I can no other answer make but thanks,"
      - "And thanks, and ever thanks. And oft good turns"
      - "Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay."
      - "But were my worth as is my conscience, firm,"
      - "You should find better dealing. What’s to do?"
      - "Shall we go see the relics of this town?"
    m:
      - "My friend Antonio, all I can say is thank you. I know words are cheap. If I had any money I’d back up my gratitude with cash. Anyway, what should we do? Should we go see the sights in the town?"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "Tomorrow, sir. Best first go see your lodging."
    m:
      - "We can do that tomorrow, sir. First we should make sure you have somewhere to stay."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "I am not weary, and ’tis long to night:"
      - "I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes"
      - "With the memorials and the things of fame"
      - "That do renown this city."
    m:
      - "I’m not tired, and night is a long time away. Come on, let’s go see the sights."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "    Would you’d pardon me;"
      - "I do not without danger walk these streets:"
      - "Once in a sea-fight ’gainst the Count his galleys"
      - "I did some service, of such note indeed,"
      - "That were I ta’en here it would scarce be answered."
    m:
      - "I’m sorry, but I can’t. You see, it’s dangerous for me to walk in these streets. Once in a battle at sea I did a lot of damage to Count Orsino’s warships. If they arrested me here, it’d be the end of me."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "Belike you slew great number of his people?"
    m:
      - "You probably killed a lot of his men?"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "The offence is not of such a bloody nature;"
      - "Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel"
      - "Might well have given us bloody argument."
      - "It might have since been answered in repaying"
      - "What we took from them, which, for traffic’s sake,"
      - "Most of our city did. Only myself stood out;"
      - "For which, if I be lapsèd in this place,"
      - "I shall pay dear."
    m:
      - "No, I didn’t do anything as violent as that, though we would’ve been justified in shedding a little blood over the matter. The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them—which most of our city did, for the sake of friendly trade relations. I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole. That’s why I’ll pay dearly if they find me here."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "  Do not then walk too open."
    m:
      - "Then don’t make yourself too conspicuous."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here’s my purse."
      - "*(giving him money)*"
      - "In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,"
      - "Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet,"
      - "Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge"
      - "With viewing of the town. There shall you have me."
    m:
      - "You’re right. Hang on a minute, here’s some money for you. *(he gives SEBASTIAN money)* The best place to stay around here is an inn called the Elephant, in the suburbs south of the city. I’ll arrange for our meals while you enjoy yourself and educate yourself by looking at the town. You’ll find me at the Elephant."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "Why I your purse?"
    m:
      - "Why are you giving me your purse?"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "Haply your eye shall light upon some toy"
      - "You have desire to purchase, and your store,"
      - "I think, is not for idle markets, sir."
    m:
      - "Maybe you’ll see some little trinket you want to buy. I doubt you’ve got enough money for little purchases like that."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "I’ll be your purse-bearer and leave you"
      - "For an hour."
    m:
      - "I’ll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "  To the Elephant."
    m:
      - "We’ll meet at the Elephant."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:
      - "    I do remember."
    m:
      - "I remember."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
