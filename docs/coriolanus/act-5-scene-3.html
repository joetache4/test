<p>Must, as a foreign recreant, be led</p>
<p>With manacles thorough our streets, or else</p>
<p>triumphantly tread on thy country’s ruin,</p>
<p>And bear the palm for having bravely shed</p>
<p>Thy wife and children’s blood. For myself, son,</p>
<p>I purpose not to wait on fortune till</p>

<p>Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner</p>

<b>VOLUMNIA</b>
<p>Even if we were silent and didn’t speak, our clothing and the condition of our bodies would betray the lives we’ve led since your exile. Think how we three are worse off than all living women, because seeing you—a sight that should make our eyes flow with tears of joy and our hearts dance with relief—constrains our eyes from weeping and shakes our hearts with fear and sorrow to make the mother, wife, and child see the son, the husband, and the father tearing his country’s bowels out. Your hatred will kill us poor people. You deny our prayers to the gods, which is the only comfort we have, and if we can’t pray—and pray for our country—where will we go if you succeed, where will we go? Alas, either we must lose the country, our dear mother, or else we must lose you, our comfort in the country. We will inevitably face tragedy, but we do have a wish for one side to win. Either you must, as a traitor, be led with handcuffs thorough our streets, or else triumphantly march on your ruined country and wear the medal for having bravely shed your wife and children’s blood. For myself, son, I don’t intend to rely on fortune until these wars end. If I can’t persuade you to reach a noble compromise with both sides rather than seek total destruction, when you march to assault your country you’ll be treading—and believe me about this—on your mother’s womb, which brought you into this world.</p>

<p>Nay, go not from us thus.</p>
<p>If it were so that our request did tend</p>
<p>To save the Romans, thereby to destroy</p>
<p>The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,</p>
<p>As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit</p>
<p>Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces</p>
<p>May say “This mercy we have show’d;” the Romans,</p>
<p>“This we received;” and each in either side</p>
<p>Give the all-hail to thee and cry “Be blest</p>
<p>For making up this peace!” Thou know’st, great son,</p>
<p>The end of war’s uncertain, but this certain,</p>
<p>That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit</p>
<p>Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,</p>
<p>Whose repetition will be dogg’d with curses;</p>
<p>Whose chronicle thus writ: “The man was noble,</p>
<p>But with his last attempt he wiped it out;</p>
<p>Destroy’d his country, and his name remains</p>
<p>To the ensuing age abhorr’d.” Speak to me, son:</p>
<p>Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,</p>
<p>To imitate the graces of the gods;</p>
<p>To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o’ the air,</p>
<p>And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt</p>
<p>That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?</p>
<p>Think’st thou it honourable for a noble man</p>
<p>Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:</p>
<p>He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:</p>
<p>Perhaps thy childishness will move him more</p>
<p>Than can our reasons. There’s no man in the world</p>
<p>More bound to ’s mother; yet here he lets me prate</p>
<p>Like one i’ the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life</p>
<p>Show’d thy dear mother any courtesy,</p>
<p>When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,</p>
<p>Has cluck’d thee to the wars and safely home,</p>

<p>To his surname Coriolanus ’longs more pride</p>

<p>This is the last: so we will home to Rome,</p>
<p>And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold ’s:</p>
<p>This boy, that cannot tell what he would have</p>
<p>But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,</p>
<p>Does reason our petition with more strength</p>
<p>Than thou hast to deny ’t. Come, let us go:</p>

<p>His wife is in Corioli and his child</p>

<b>VOLUMNIA</b>
<p>No, don’t leave us now. If it were the case that our request was to save the Romans and thereby destroy the Volsces, whom you serve, you might condemn us for poisoning your honor. But no, our appeal is for you to reconcile with them so that the Volsces may say, “We have shown mercy,” and the Romans may say, “We received mercy,” and both sides will salute you and cry, “May you be blessed for making this peace!” You know, great son, that the outcome of war is uncertain. But it’s certain that if you conquer Rome, the benefit you’ll reap in so doing is a name whose repetition will be plagued with curses. You’ll be remembered with these words: “The man was noble, but with his last attack he gave up his nobility, destroyed his country, and his name remains forever hated.” Speak to me, son. You’ve aspired to great honor, to behave like a god, to tear apart the sky with thunder and yet throw your lightning bolt so that it would only split an oak. Why don’t you speak? Do you think it’s honorable for a noble man to always remember how he has been wronged? Daughter, speak—he doesn’t like your weeping. Speak, boy—perhaps your childishness will move him more than our reasons can. There’s no man in the world more tied to his mother, and yet here he lets me prattle on like a common criminal. Never in your life have you done your dear mother any favors, while she, poor woman, who didn’t want to have another child, has cared for you while you were at war and safely home, heaped with honors. If you think my request is unfair, then turn me down. But if it’s not, then you’re a liar and the gods will punish you for failing to give me what you owe me as a son. He turns away. Down, ladies. Let’s shame him by getting on our knees. His surname, Coriolanus, has more pride than pity for our prayers. Down! This is the end. <em>(The women and young Martius kneel)</em> We’ll go home to Rome and die among our neighbors. Wait, look. This boy, who doesn’t know what’s going to happen to him but kneels and holds up his hands for fellowship, lends more strength to our petition than you have strength to deny. Come, let’s go. This fellow has a Volscian mother, his wife is in Corioles, and his child looks just like him by chance. Send us away. I’ll be silent until our city is on fire, and then I’ll speak a little.</p>

<p><em>(crying)</em> Oh, mother, mother! What have you done? Look, the heavens are opening, the gods are looking down and laughing at this unnatural scene. Oh, my mother, mother! Oh! You have won a happy victory for Rome. But for your son—believe it, oh, believe it—because you have convinced him, he’s now in mortal danger. But let it come. Aufidius, though I cannot fight this war for you, I’ll make arrange a peaceful settlement, fair to both sides. Now, good Aufidius, if you were in my place, wouldn’t you have listened to your mother and done as I did, Aufidius?</p>
