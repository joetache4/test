<p>in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard</p>

<p>I could only hear bits and pieces of the conversation. But I could hear the king and Camillo speaking in tones of admiration. They looked at each other so intently and with such astonishment that it seemed as if their eyes might pop out. Even their inability to speak communicated something, and so did their gestures. They looked as if the world had been taken hostage, or destroyed. They were obviously amazed. But even the most astute observer would be unable to say if it was joy or sorrow they felt, though obviously a great deal of one or the other.</p>

<p>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by</p>

<p>of Queen Hermione’s, her jewel about the neck of it,</p>
<p>the letters of Antigonus found with it which they</p>
<p>know to be his character, the majesty of the</p>
<p>creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection</p>
<p>of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,</p>

<b>THIRD GENTLEMAN</b>
<p>It’s very true, if truth was ever proven by evidence. All the stories match up and are consistent. It all shows that Perdita is certainly the king’s daughter— the cloak of Queen Hermione, the jewel that was found around her neck, letters in Antigonus’ handwriting found with her, how much she looks like her mother, her noble bearing, which shows her to be more than a shepherd’s daughter, and many other things. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?</p>

<p>seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their</p>
<p>joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,</p>
<p>holding up of hands, with countenances of such</p>
<p>distraction that they were to be known by garment,</p>
<p>not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of</p>
<p>himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that</p>
<p>joy were now become a loss, cries “O, thy mother,</p>
<p>thy mother!” then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then</p>
<p>embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his</p>
<p>daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old</p>
<p>shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten</p>
<p>conduit of many kings’ reigns. I never heard of such</p>
<p>another encounter, which lames report to follow it</p>

<p>Then you’ve missed something indescribable. You would have seen one joy upon another. It was so emotional that they both wept. They raised their eyes to heaven, clasped hands, and their faces were so contorted with emotion that you could only recognize them by their clothing. Our king, overcome with joy at having found his daughter, cried out, “Oh, your mother, your mother,” as if that joy had become a loss. Then he asked Polixenes for forgiveness, then embraced his son-in-law, and then harassed his daughter with embraces. Then he thanks the old shepherd, who stands there weeping like a stone statue. I’ve never heard of such an event. It’s impossible to tell what happen, or to describe it.</p>

<p>attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one</p>

<p>I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my</p>

<p>One of the most moving things of all, which brought me to tears, was when the king bravely and sadly told his daughter how the queen died. How intently Perdita listened! She went from sorrow to sorrow, and finally said, “Alas,” and seemed to bleed tears. I would say my heart nearly broke. Even the most hardened onlooker was affected. Some fainted, and all mourned. If the world could have seen it, everyone would have felt sorrow.</p>
