    ms: "ORLANDO enters, holding a piece of paper."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love."
      - "And thou, thrice-crownéd queen of night, survey"
      - "With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,"
      - "Thy huntress’ name that my full life doth sway."
      - "O Rosalind, these trees shall be my books,"
      - "And in their barks my thoughts I’ll character,"
      - "That every eye which in this forest looks"
      - "Shall see thy virtue witnessed everywhere."
      - "Run, run, Orlando, carve on every tree"
      - "The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she."
    m:
      - "Hang there on this tree, you lines of poetry, and bear witness to my love. And you, goddess of the moon, queen of the night—with your chaste eye, from your pale home up above—watch your huntress, who has the power to control my life. Oh, Rosalind, these trees will be my books—I’ll write my thoughts down on their bark. That way, everyone who passes through this forest will find your virtues everywhere. Run, run, Orlando, on every tree carve praises of her beauty, her virtue, and her inexpressibility."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."

  - os: "Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE"
    ms: "CORIN and TOUCHSTONE enter."

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?"
    m:
      - "And how are you liking the shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?"

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humor well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?"
    m:
      - "Well, in and of itself, it is a good life, but given that it’s a shepherd’s life, it’s worthless. In the fact that it’s solitary, I enjoy it very much; but in the sense that it’s private, it’s terrible. Now, I’m very pleased with it being outdoors, but in its not being at the court, it is boring. Being a simple life, it suits me very well, but being a life without plenty, it doesn’t suit me at all. Are you any kind of philosopher yourself, shepherd?"

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "No more but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at ease he is, and that he that wants money, means, and content is without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred."
    m:
      - "Only in that I know that the sicker one gets, the worse one feels, and that the man who lacks money, employment, and happiness is without three good friends. I know that rain makes things wet and fire burns things. I know that a good pasture makes sheep fat, that the main cause of night is the absence of sun, and that the man who isn’t smart by nature and hasn’t learned anything from his schooling will complain of his lack of good manners, or he comes from very dull parents indeed."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd?"
    m:
      - "You’re a natural-born philosopher! Were you ever at court, shepherd?"

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "No, truly."
    m:
      - "Honestly, no."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Then thou art damned."
    m:
      - "Then you are damned."

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "Nay, I hope."
    m:
      - "I hope not."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Truly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side."
    m:
      - "Yep, you’re damned like a roasted egg: all on one side."

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "For not being at court? Your reason."
    m:
      - "I’m damned for not having been at court? Explain."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if thou never saw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd."
    m:
      - "Well, if you were never at court, you were never exposed to good manners; if you never witnessed good manners, your manners must be wicked; wickedness is a sin, and committing sins leads to damnation. You are in a perilous state, shepherd."

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands. That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds."
    m:
      - "Not at all, Touchstone. The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court. You told me that you don’t salute at the court but kiss hands. Now, if courtiers were shepherds, that kind of courtesy would be unclean."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Instance, briefly. Come, instance."
    m:
      - "Give a quick example. Come, explain."

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy."
    m:
      - "Why, because we’re always handling our ewes, and their fleece, as you know, is greasy."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say. Come."
    m:
      - "What, don’t courtiers’ hands sweat? And isn’t a sheep’s grease as wholesome as a man’s sweat? That’s a poor example. A better example—come on."

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "Besides, our hands are hard."
    m:
      - "Besides, our hands are hard and calloused."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance. Come."
    m:
      - "Then your lips will feel them more quickly. Shallow thinking, yet again. Come on."

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet."
    m:
      - "Our hands are often covered in tar, from performing surgery on our sheep.Would you have us country folks kiss each other’s tarred hands? Courtiers’ hands are perfumed."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Most shallow man. Thou worms’ meat in respect of a good piece of flesh, indeed. Learn of the wise and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd."
    m:
      - "You shallow thinker! You worthless man! You are about as much of a thinker as worm’s meat is a nice steak. Learn from the wise, and comprehend: the courtier’s perfume is made from cat discharge—much more disgusting than tar. Fix your example, shepherd."

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "You have too courtly a wit for me. I’ll rest."
    m:
      - "Your wit is too courtly for me. I’ll rest now."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man. God make incision in thee; thou art raw."
    m:
      - "You’re going to rest while you’re still damned? God help you, foolish man. Pray God does some surgery on you: you need to be fixed."

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "Sir, I am a true laborer. I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man’s happiness, glad of other men’s good, content with my harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck."
    m:
      - "Sir, I’m a true, simple laborer: I earn what I eat, get what I wear, hate no man, envy no man’s happiness, am happy for other men’s good fortune and satisfied with my own bad fortune, and the source of my greatest pride is watching my ewes graze and my lambs feed."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou be’st not damned for this, the devil himself will have no shepherds. I cannot see else how thou shouldst ’scape."
    m:
      - "That’s another sin arising from your ignorance: you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation. You act as a pimp to a young ewe by forcing her to have sex with a crooked-headed, horny old ram—a totally unreasonable match. If you’re not damned for that, then the devil must be keeping shepherds out of hell; I can’t see how else you can hope to escape."

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress’ brother."
    m:
      - "Here comes young Mr. Ganymede, my new mistress’ brother."

      - "All the most beautiful paintings"
      - "Are black when compared to Rosalind."
      - "Don’t think of any beauty"
      - "But the beauty of Rosalind."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "I’ll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted. It is the right butter-women’s rank to market."
    m:
      - "I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row, excepting meal times and sleeping hours. That awful, plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Out, fool."
    m:

      - "Such a nut is Rosalind."
      - "He that sweetest rose will find"
      - "Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind."
      - "This is the very false gallop of verses. Why do you infect yourself with them?"
    m:
      - "Let me try:"
      - "If there’s a buck who needs a doe"
      - "Tell him Rosalind will do."
      - "A cat in heat will look for a mate,"
      - "And Rosalind certainly will too."
      - "Winter garments need to be filled with something,"
      - "And so does skinny Rosalind."
      - "After you harvest, you have to sheaf and bind"
      - "So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart."
      - "The sweetest nut has the sourest rind"
      - "And Rosalind is that kind of nut."
      - "The man who finds the sweetest rose"
      - "Will be pricked by it, and by Rosalind."
      - "This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along. Why bother with them?"

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Peace, you dull fool. I found them on a tree."
    m:
      - "Quiet, you stupid fool. I found them on a tree."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Truly, the tree yields bad fruit."
    m:
      - "Well, the tree bears rotten fruit."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "I’ll graft it with you, and then I shall graft it with a medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i’ th’ country, for you’ll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that’s the right virtue of the medlar."
    m:
      - "I’ll graft you onto that tree, and when I do I’ll be grafting onto it a medlar. The fruit the tree bears will be the earliest to ripen in the country because, God knows, *you’ll*  be rotten before you’re half-ripe, which is how medlars are."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "You have said, but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge."
    m:

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "That’s no matter. The feet might bear the verses."
    m:
      - "That’s not a problem: the feet can bear the verses."

    m:

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came, for look here what I found on a palm tree. I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras’ time, that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly remember."
    m:
      - "I was working through my wonder when you arrived. Look at what I found on a palm tree. I haven’t been rhymed about like this since my past life, when I was an Irish rat, but I can hardly remember that."

I prithee, tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst stammer, that thou might’st pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow-mouthed bottle—either too much at once, or none at all. I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth, that I may drink thy tidings."
    m:
      - "Good grief, do you think that just because I’m dressed like a man, I have a man’s patience? Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas. I’m begging you, tell me who it is quickly, and speak fast. I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow-necked bottle: either too much at once or none at all. I’m begging you, take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news."

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "Nay, he hath but a little beard."
    m:
      - "No, he has only a little beard."

    o:
      - "Why, God will send more, if the man will be thankful. Let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin."
    m:
      - "Well, eventually God will send him some more hair, if he thanks Him. I’ll wait till his beard grows in, if you’ll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on."

    m:
      - "Oh no! What am I going to do in my man’s clothing? What did he do when you saw him? What did he say? How did he look? Where did he go? What brings him here? Did he ask about me? Where is he staying? How did he say good-bye? And when will you see him again? Answer me in a word."

  - sp: CELIA
    o:

And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in ’t."

When he did, being the changeable boy I am, I’d mope, act effeminate, switch moods, long for him, like him, be proud and standoffish, be dreamy, full of mannerisms, unpredictable, full of tears and then smiles; be passionate about everything, then nothing. Most boys and women act just like this. I’d like him one minute and despise him the next; cry for him, then spit at him—until finally I drove love out and anger in. He abandoned the world, and hid himself away in a monastery. So I cured him, and I’ll cure you just the same, leaving you as clean as a sheep’s heart, without one spot of love in you."
