<p>If by your art, my dearest father, you have</p>
<p>Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.</p>
<p>The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,</p>

<p>Dashed all to pieces. Oh, the cry did knock</p>
<p>Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perished.</p>
<p>Had I been any god of power, I would</p>

<p>Dear father, if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers, please put an end to it. The sky’s so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea weren’t swelling up to the sky to put its fire out. Oh, I suffered along with all the men I watched suffer! A fine ship, with some good people in it, I’m sure, smashed to pieces. Their dying shouts broke my heart! The poor people died. If I’d been a god I would’ve let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying.</p>

With Antonio possessing such powers and wealth, coming not only from my income but also from his ability to take whatever my authority allowed him to take, Antonio started to believe that he was the duke, like some liar who begins to believe in his own lie.
