    o:
      - "Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him."
    m:
      - "If and when he asks for our votes, we shouldn’t deny him."

  - sp: SECOND CITIZEN
    o:
      - "We may, sir, if we will."
    m:
      - "We can deny him, sir, if we want to."

  - sp: THIRD CITIZEN
    o:
      - "We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a"
      - "power that we have no power to do; for if he show us"
      - "his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our"
      - "tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if"
      - "he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him"
      - "our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is"
      - "monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,"
      - "were to make a monster of the multitude: of the"
      - "which we being members, should bring ourselves to be"
      - "monstrous members."
    m:
      - "We have the right to deny him, but it wouldn’t be the right thing to do. If he shows us his wounds and tells us of his deeds, we must honor those wounds with our votes. And if he tells us of his noble deeds, we must then tell him of our gratitude. Ingratitude is monstrous, and for the people to be seen as ungrateful would make us into monsters."

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:
      - "And to make us no better thought of, a little help"
      - "will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he"
      - "himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude."
    m:
      - "And it wouldn’t take much to make us worse thought of.  When we complained about the corn, he didn’t hesitate to call us an unstable mass of people."

  - sp: THIRD CITIZEN
    o:
      - "We have been called so of many; not that our heads"
      - "are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,"
      - "but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and"
      - "truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of"
      - "one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,"
      - "and their consent of one direct way should be at"
      - "once to all the points o’ the compass."
    m:
      - "Many people have called us that. Not because some of us have brown hair, some black, some blond and some bald, but because our opinions are so diverse. I truly think that if all our opinions were to come from one mind, they would go east, west, north, and south. All they could agree on would be to go in different directions."

  - sp: SECOND CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would"
      - "fly?"
    m:
      - "Do you think so? Which way do you think my opinion would go?"

  - sp: THIRD CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man’s"
      - "will; ’tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but"
      - "if it were at liberty, ’twould, sure, southward."
    m:
      - "You’re stubborn, so your opinion will stay stuck inside you until another man’s will expresses itself first. If yours could come out, though, it would surely go south."

  - sp: SECOND CITIZEN
    o:
      - "Why that way?"
    m:
      - "Why that way?"

  - sp: THIRD CITIZEN
    o:
      - "To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts"
      - "melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return"
      - "for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife."
    m:
      - "To lose itself in the plague-ridden air. Three-quarters of it would melt away in the contagious dew, and the remaining quarter would have a conscience and return to help you get a wife."

    o:
      - "You are never without your tricks: you may, you may."

      - "never a worthier man."
    m:
      - "Are you all ready to vote? It doesn’t actually matter, since the majority vote wins. If only he cared about the people, he would be the most deserving man there ever was."

      - "come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and"

    m:
      - "Here he comes, wearing the gown of humility. Watch his behavior. We’re not supposed to all stay together but rather go up to him where he’s standing, either alone or in groups of two or three. He’s supposed to make his request to us individually, and each of us has the separate honor of giving him our own vote in our voice.  Follow me. I’ll show you how to go up to him."

    m:
      - "You should consider me virtuous because I don’t give my love away easily. Sir, I’ll flatter my sworn brothers, the people, so they’ll think well of me. It’s a custom they consider noble. And since they’d rather decide based on what hat I’m wearing than on who I am, I’ll practice taking off my hat and bowing insincerely. That is to say, sir, I’ll pretend to be enchanted by them, as some popular men do, and give my false admiration plentifully to those who desire it. So I ask you, may I be consul?"

      - "The one part suffer’d, the other will I do."
    m:
      - "Most sweet voters! It’s better to die, better to starve, than to beg to be chosen for a position you already deserve. Why must I stand here in this hypocritical toga and beg the commoners for their meaningless approval, which I shouldn’t need? Custom forces me to do it, and what custom requires, we must do. It’s an ancient tradition that has gone on for so long that no one can see that it’s a huge mistake. I wish I didn’t have to play the fool, but the honor of the consulship goes to he who will. I’m halfway done. I’ll do the other half."

    o:
      - "Could you not have told him"
      - "As you were lesson’d, when he had no power,"
      - "But was a petty servant to the state,"
      - "He was your enemy, ever spake against"
      - "Your liberties and the charters that you bear"
      - "I’ the body of the weal; and now, arriving"
      - "A place of potency and sway o’ the state,"
      - "If he should still malignantly remain"
      - "Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might"
      - "Be curses to yourselves? You should have said"
      - "That as his worthy deeds did claim no less"
      - "Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature"
      - "Would think upon you for your voices and"
      - "Translate his malice towards you into love,"
      - "Standing your friendly lord."
    m:
      - "Couldn’t you have told him as you were instructed? When he had no power and was only a petty servant of the state, he was your enemy. He has always spoken against your freedom and the legal privileges you have. Now that he’s arriving in a position of power and influence on the state, if he remains such an evil enemy to the people, you might have cause to curse yourself for giving him your votes. You should have said that while his acts of bravery do entitle him to the consulship, he should also be gracious and think well of you for giving him your approval. He should transform his hatred toward you into love and become your political advocate."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Thus to have said,"
      - "As you were fore-advised, had touch’d his spirit"
      - "And tried his inclination; from him pluck’d"
      - "Either his gracious promise, which you might,"
      - "As cause had call’d you up, have held him to"
      - "Or else it would have gall’d his surly nature,"
      - "Which easily endures not article"
      - "Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,"
      - "You should have ta’en the advantage of his choler"
      - "And pass’d him unelected."
    m:
      - "If you’d said that, as you were advised ahead of time, it would have touched his spirit and changed his inclination. You might have gotten a gracious promise from him, which you could have held him to when you needed it.  Or else it would have provoked his angry nature, which is easily done, and he would have gone into a rage. You could have used his anger as reason not to vote for him."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Did you perceive"
      - "He did solicit you in free contempt"
      - "When he did need your loves, and do you think"
      - "That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,"
      - "When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies"
      - "No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry"
      - "Against the rectorship of judgment?"
    m:
      - "Didn’t you notice that he asked for your vote in blatant contempt even when he needed your approval? So don’t you think that his contempt will harm you when he has power to exercise? Didn’t you have any courage? Couldn’t you cry out against the status quo?"

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Have you"
      - "Ere now denied the asker? and now again"
      - "Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow"
      - "Your sued-for tongues?"
    m:
      - "Haven’t you ever refused to vote for someone? And now you give your vote to someone who didn’t even ask for it but mocked you instead?"

  - sp: THIRD CITIZEN
    o:
      - "He’s not confirm’d; we may deny him yet."
    m:

  - sp: SECOND CITIZEN
    o:
      - "And will deny him:"
      - "I’ll have five hundred voices of that sound."
    m:

  - sp: FIRST CITIZEN
    o:

    m:
      - "I’ll get a thousand people and their friends, too."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,"
      - "They have chose a consul that will from them take"
      - "Their liberties; make them of no more voice"
      - "Than dogs that are as often beat for barking"
      - "As therefore kept to do so."
    m:
      - "Go do it immediately, and tell those friends that they’ve chosen someone for the consul who will take away their freedoms and give them no more voice than dogs have that are repeatedly beaten for barking even though their job is to bark."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Let them assemble,"
      - "And on a safer judgment all revoke"
      - "Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,"
      - "And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not"
      - "With what contempt he wore the humble weed,"
      - "How in his suit he scorn’d you; but your loves,"
      - "Thinking upon his services, took from you"
      - "The apprehension of his present portance,"
      - "Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion"
      - "After the inveterate hate he bears you."
    m:
      - "Let them come together and make a wiser judgment to revoke your ignorant election. Emphasize his pride and his longstanding hatred of you. And don’t forget the contempt with which he wore the gown of humility and how in his quest for your votes, he scorned you. Your admiration of his past service kept you from noticing of his present way of being, which was insulting and inappropriate and reflective of the hatred he feels for you."

      - "No impediment between, but that you must"
      - "Cast your election on him."
    m:
      - "Blame us, your tribunes. Say that we pushed you not to let these obstacles stop you from voting for him, but that you must repeal your election of him."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Say, you chose him"
      - "More after our commandment than as guided"
      - "By your own true affections, and that your minds,"
      - "Preoccupied with what you rather must do"
      - "Than what you should, made you against the grain"
      - "To voice him consul: lay the fault on us."
    m:
      - "Say that you chose him based more on our instructions than on your own true feelings, and that because you were preoccupied with what you thought was expected of you, you went against your own interest by voting him consul. Lay the fault on us."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you."
      - "How youngly he began to serve his country,"
      - "How long continued, and what stock he springs of,"
      - "The noble house o’ the Marcians, from whence came"
      - "That Ancus Martius, Numa’s daughter’s son,"
      - "Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;"
      - "Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,"
      - "That our beat water brought by conduits hither;"
      - "And Censorinus, nobly named so,"
      - "Twice being by the people chosen censor,"
      - "Was his great ancestor."
    m:
      - "Indeed, don’t spare us. Say we told you all about him, about how young he was when he began to serve his country and how long he has done so, about the noble family he comes from—the same family as Ancus Martius, Numa’s daughter’s son, who was king after great Hostilius. He’s from the same family as Publius and Quintus, the ones who built our best water conduits. And his great ancestor, suitably named Censorinus, was chosen twice as censor by the people."

      - "Your sudden approbation."
    m:
      - "We asked you to remember that he’s a man descended from a famous family, who also has earned his own high praise. But you have found, weighing his present behavior against his past, that he’s definitely your enemy, and you repeal your hasty approval."

    o:

      - "With their refusal, both observe and answer"
      - "The vantage of his anger."
    m:
      - "Let them go on their own. Better to risk this mutiny than wait for the undoubtedly bigger one that would come later. If, his nature being what it is, he goes into a rage over their refusal, both watch for and take advantage of his anger."
