    o:
      - "You know since Pentecost the sum is due,"

      - "Nor now I had not, but that I am bound"
      - "To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage."
      - "Therefore make present satisfaction,"
      - "Or I’ll attach you by this officer."
    m:
      - "You’ve owed me this money since the Pentecost holiday. I haven’t pressed you for it, and I wouldn’t now except that I’m going to Persia and I need money for the trip. So pay me now, or I’ll have this officer arrest you."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "Even just the sum that I do owe to you"
      - "Is growing to me by Antipholus."
      - "And in the instant that I met with you,"

      - "I shall receive the money for the same."
      - "Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,"
      - "I will discharge my bond and thank you too."
    m:
      - "Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you. Just before I ran into you, I gave him a necklace. At five o’clock he’s going to pay me for it. Please, come to his house with me. I’ll pay what I owe you then and say thank you as well."

  - sp: COURTESAN’S OFFICER
    o:

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "While I go to the goldsmith’s house, go thou"
      - "And buy a rope’s end. That will I bestow"
      - "Among my wife and her confederates"
      - "For locking me out of my doors by day."
      - "But soft. I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone."
      - "Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me."
    m:
      - "*(to DROMIO)* I’m going to the jeweler’s house. You go buy a piece of rope—I’ll whip my wife and her cohorts for locking me out of my own house. Wait a minute! I see the jeweler. Go, be gone with you. Buy a rope and bring it to me."

      - "I promisèd your presence and the chain,"
      - "But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me."
      - "Belike you thought our love would last too long"
      - "If it were chained together, and therefore came not."
    m:
      - "*(to ANGELO)* Good luck to any man who trusts you. I swore that you would come with the necklace, but neither you nor the necklace showed up. Perhaps you were concerned about being chained to me and so decided not to come."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "Saving your merry humor, here’s the note"
      - "How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,"
      - "The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,"
      - "Which doth amount to three-odd ducats more"
      - "Than I stand debted to this gentleman."
      - "I pray you, see him presently discharged,"
      - "For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it."
    m:
      - "All joking aside, here’s an invoice spelling out exactly how many carats the necklace weighs as well as the quality of the gold and the workmanship. The total due is about three ducats more than I owe this gentleman. Please, pay him immediately. He’s about to leave on a trip and he’s waiting for the money."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "I am not furnished with the present money."
      - "Besides, I have some business in the town."
      - "Good signior, take the stranger to my house,"
      - "And with you take the chain, and bid my wife"
      - "Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof."
      - "Perchance I will be there as soon as you."
    m:
      - "I don’t have the cash right now. Besides, I have some business to take care of in town. Good signior, take this stranger to my house. Bring the necklace with you, and tell my wife to pay you the amount due. I might make it back in time to meet you."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "Then you will bring the chain to her yourself."
    m:
      - "So you’ll bring the necklace to her yourself?"

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "No, bear it with you lest I come not time enough."
    m:
      - "No. You bring it in case I can’t make it."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?"
    m:
      - "All right, sir, I will. Do you have it with you?"

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "An if I have not, sir, I hope you have,"
      - "Or else you may return without your money."
    m:

      - "And I, to blame, have held him here too long."
    m:
      - "Listen, please, give me the necklace. This gentleman’s ready to go. The wind is right and it’s high tide, and I’ve delayed him a long time already."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Good Lord! You use this dalliance to excuse"
      - "Your breach of promise to the Porpentine."
      - "I should have chid you for not bringing it,"
      - "But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl."
    m:
      - "Good Lord! You’re using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised. I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it, but you started fighting with me first."

  - sp: SECOND MERCHANT
    o:
      - "The hour steals on. I pray you, sir, dispatch."
    m:
      - "It’s getting late. Please, sir, hurry up."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "You hear how he importunes me. The chain!"
    m:
      - "Antipholus, you hear how the man pleads with me. Give me the necklace!"

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money."
    m:
      - "Give it to my wife, and get your money."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "Come, come. You know I gave it you even now."
      - "Either send the chain, or send me by some token."
    m:
      - "Come, come. You know I gave it to you just now. Send the necklace to her, or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Fie, now you run this humor out of breath."
      - "Come, where’s the chain? I pray you, let me see it."
    m:
      - "Damn it, this isn’t funny. Where’s the necklace? Let me see it."

  - sp: SECOND MERCHANT
    o:
      - "My business cannot brook this dalliance."
      - "*(to ANTIPHOLUS)* Good sir, say whe’er you’ll answer me or no."
      - "If not, I’ll leave him to the Officer."
    m:
      - "My business cannot wait for this delay. *(to ANTIPHOLUS)* Good sir, tell me if you’re going to pay me. If not, I’ll turn this man over to the officer."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "I answer you? What should I answer you?"
    m:
      - "Pay you? What should I pay you?"

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "The money that you owe me for the chain."
    m:
      - "The money you owe me for the necklace."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "I owe you none till I receive the chain."
    m:
      - "I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "You know I gave it you half an hour since."
    m:
      - "You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "You gave me none. You wrong me much to say so."
    m:
      - "You gave me nothing, and you wrong me by saying you did."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "You wrong me more, sir, in denying it."
      - "Consider how it stands upon my credit."
    m:
      - "You wrong me even more, sir, by denying it. Consider how poorly this reflects on me."

  - sp: SECOND MERCHANT
    o:
      - "Well, officer, arrest him at my suit."
    m:
      - "Well, officer, I charge you to arrest him."

  - sp: OFFICER
    o:
      - "I do, *(to ANGELO)* and charge you in the Duke’s name to obey me."
    m:
      - "I will. *(to ANGELO)* And I order you to obey me, in the name of the duke."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "This touches me in reputation."
      - "Either consent to pay this sum for me,"
      - "Or I attach you by this officer."
    m:
      - "This harms my reputation. Either pay this sum, Antipholus, or I’ll have this officer arrest you."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Consent to pay thee that I never had?—"
      - "Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar’st."
    m:
      - "Pay for something I never got? Go ahead, you fool. Arrest me if you dare."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "Here is thy fee. Arrest him, officer."
      - "I would not spare my brother in this case"
      - "If he should scorn me so apparently."
    m:
      - "Officer, here’s your fee—arrest him. I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly."

  - sp: OFFICER
    o:
      - "I do arrest you, sir. You hear the suit."
    m:
      - "You’re under arrest, sir. You hear the charges."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "I do obey thee till I give thee bail."
      - "But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear"
      - "As all the metal in your shop will answer."
    m:
      - "I’ll obey you until I can make bail. But Angelo, you’ll pay for this, even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop."

  - sp: ANGELO
    o:
      - "Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,"
      - "To your notorious shame, I doubt it not."
    m:
      - "Sir, the laws of Ephesus will be on my side, and you’ll be embarrassed. I’m certain of it."

    o:
      - "Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum"
      - "That stays but till her owner comes aboard,"
      - "And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,"
      - "I have conveyed aboard, and I have bought"
      - "The oil, the balsamum and aqua vitae."
      - "The ship is in her trim; the merry wind"
      - "Blows fair from land. They stay for naught at all"
      - "But for their owner, master, and yourself."
    m:
      - "Master, there’s a ship from Epidamnum that’s going to set sail as soon as its owner gets on board. I’ve left our luggage on the ship, and I bought the oil, balm, and liquor you wanted. The ship is ready, the wind is up, and the sailors are only waiting for their owner and for you."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

      - "And told thee to what purpose and what end."
    m:
      - "You drunken slave, I sent you for a rope, and I told you what to do with it."

  - sp: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "You sent me for a rope’s end as soon."
      - "You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark."
    m:
      - "Yeah, right—you sent me to get whipped. You sent me to the port to find a ship."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "I will debate this matter at more leisure"
      - "And teach your ears to list me with more heed."
      - "To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight."
      - "Give her this key, and tell her in the desk"
      - "That’s cover’d o’er with Turkish tapestry"

Give her this key, and tell her that there’s money in the desk that’s covered with a Turkish tapestry. Have her send it to me. Tell her that I’ve been arrested and the money will be my bail. Hurry, you slave! Go! Officer, take me to prison until the money comes."

      - "She is too big, I hope, for me to compass."
      - "Thither I must, although against my will,"
      - "For servants must their masters’ minds fulfill."
    m:
      - "To Adriana? That’s where we had lunch. Where that “sweetheart” said I was her husband! She’s too much for me to handle. But I must go there, against my will: servants must fulfill their masters’ wishes."
