      - "O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,"
      - "Which have no correspondence with true sight!"
      - "Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,"
      - "That censures falsely what they see aright?"
      - "If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,"
      - "What means the world to say it is not so?"
      - "If it be not, then love doth well denote"
      - "Love’s eye is not so true as all men’s: no,"
      - "How can it? O how can love’s eye be true,"
      - "That is so vexed with watching and with tears?"
      - "No marvel then, though I mistake my view;"
      - "The sun itself sees not till heaven clears."
      - "  O cunning love! With tears thou keep’st me blind,"
      - "  Lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find."
    m:
      - "Oh, me! What kind of eyes has love put into my head that I don’t see anything accurately? Or if my eyes do see correctly, what’s happened to my judgment to make me wrongly criticize what they see? If the woman I love to look at is beautiful, why does the rest of the world say she’s not? If she’s not, then a person in love doesn’t see as accurately as others. No—how can a lover see right? Oh, how can a lover’s eye work properly when it’s so distressed by staying awake and crying? It’s no wonder then that I’m wrong about what I see; the sun itself doesn’t see anything until the sky is clear. Oh, ingenious love, you keep me blind with tears so I won’t discover my lover’s foul faults, as I would if my eyes worked properly."
