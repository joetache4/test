      - "Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,"
      - "And I will comment upon that offense."
      - "Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,"
      - "Against thy reasons making no defense."
      - "Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,"
      - "To set a form upon desired change,"
      - "As I’ll myself disgrace, knowing thy will;"
      - "I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,"
      - "Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue"
      - "Thy sweet belovèd name no more shall dwell,"
      - "Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong"
      - "And haply of our old acquaintance tell."
      - "  For thee against myself I’ll vow debate,"
      - "  For I must ne’er love him whom thou dost hate."

      - "*(Continuing from Sonnet 88)* If you tell people you left me because of some fault of mine, I will expand upon whatever you say I did wrong. Say I’m lame, and I’ll start limping immediately, without trying to defend myself against your accusations. My love, in finding a reason to justify leaving me, you can’t disgrace me half as badly as I’ll disgrace myself, as soon as I know what you want. I’ll pretend I don’t know you and act like a stranger. I won’t go where I might run into you. And I won’t mention your beloved name anymore in case I’d dirty it by reminding people that we used to be acquainted. For your sake, I’ll vow to be my own enemy, because I must not love someone whom you hate."
