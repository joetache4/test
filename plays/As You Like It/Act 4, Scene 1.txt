    ms: "ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES enter."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee."
    m:
      - "Please, pretty young man, I’d like to get to know you better."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "They say you are a melancholy fellow."
    m:
      - "They say you are a melancholy fellow."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "I am so. I do love it better than laughing."
    m:
      - "I am. I like it better than laughing."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards."
    m:
      - "People who are either too serious or too silly are awful. They make themselves targets for ridicule even faster than drunks do."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing."
    m:
      - "Well, I think it’s good to be serious and keep quiet."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Why then, ’tis good to be a post."
    m:
      - "In that case it’s good to be a post."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the musician’s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s, which is politic; nor the lady’s, which is nice; nor the lover’s, which is all these, but it is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness."
    m:
      - "I’m not a scholar’s kind of melancholy, which is all about impressing one’s peers, or a musician’s, which comes from his passion for his art. I don’t have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer. My melancholy is not like a lady’s—which is nothing more than an affectation—nor like a lover’s, which combines all of these qualities. My melancholy is purely my own—a compound made from many ingredients. I’m serious because I’ve traveled so much. When I think about all the things I’ve seen, I sink into deep thoughts."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "A traveler. By my faith, you have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men’s. Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands."
    m:
      - "You’re a traveler. Well then, you have good reason to be sad. I’m afraid you’ve sold your own land to see other men’s. To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "Yes, I have gained my experience."
    m:
      - "Not true. I gained my experience."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad— and to travel for it, too."
    m:
      - "And your experience makes you sad. I’d rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad—and to travel for all that trouble, no less!"

  - os: "Enter ORLANDO"
    ms: "ORLANDO enters."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind."
    m:
      - "Good day and happiness to you, darling Rosalind."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "Nay then, God be wi’ you, an you talk in blank verse."
    m:
      - "No—I’ll say goodbye if you’re going to talk in blank verse."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Farewell, Monsieur Traveler. Look you lisp and wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola."
    m:
      - "Goodbye, Mr. Traveler. Make sure to keep up your foreign accent, wear strange clothes, belittle all the benefits you receive from your native land and fall out of love with it, and nearly curse God for making you look like the Englishman you are, or else I’ll never believe you’ve paddled in a gondola in a Venetian canal, as you say you have."

  - os: "Exit JAQUES"
    ms: "JAQUES exits."

  - o:
      - "*(as Ganymede pretending to be ROSALIND)* Why, how now, Orlando, where have you been all this while? You a lover? An you serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more."
    m:
      - "*(as Ganymede pretending to be ROSALIND)* What’s going on, Orlando? Where have you been all this time? And you call yourself a lover? If you ever insult me like this again, don’t bother coming around here again."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise."
    m:
      - "My beautiful Rosalind, I’m only an hour late."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Break an hour’s promise in love? He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o’ th’ shoulder, but I’ll warrant him heart-whole."
    m:
      - "You’d break a date with your beloved by a whole hour? A man who will dare to meet his lover even a thousandth part of a minute late—well, it’s possible he likes her, but I doubt he really loves the woman."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Pardon me, dear Rosalind."
    m:
      - "Forgive me, darling Rosalind."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as lief be wooed of a snail."
    m:
      - "No, if you’re ever late like this again, I’ll refuse to see you. I’d rather be wooed by a snail."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Of a snail?"
    m:
      - "A snail?"

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Ay, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head—a better jointure, I think, than you make a woman. Besides, he brings his destiny with him."
    m:
      - "Yes, a snail. Because even though he’s slow, he carries his house on his head—a better offer than you can make a woman, I think. Besides, he brings his fate with him."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "What’s that?"
    m:
      - "What fate is that?"

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for. But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife."
    m:
      - "Why, his cuckold’s horns, of course—the kind you men are always blaming on your wives. See, the snail already has its horns, which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife’s infidelity."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Virtue is no hornmaker, and my Rosalind is virtuous."
    m:
      - "A virtuous woman won’t give her husband horns, and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "And I am your Rosalind."
    m:
      - "And I am your Rosalind."

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "*(as Aliena)* It pleases him to call you so, but he hath a"
      - "Rosalind of a better leer than you."
    m:
      - "*(as Aliena)* He likes calling you that, but he’s got another Rosalind out there with a prettier face."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humor, and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I were your very, very Rosalind?"
    m:
      - "Come on, woo me, woo me. I’m in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want. What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind?"

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "I would kiss before I spoke."
    m:
      - "I’d kiss you before I spoke."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were graveled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss."
    m:
      - "No, it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you’ve run out of things to say. When good orators finish talking, they spit; when lovers do (God help us if they ever do), they kiss."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "How if the kiss be denied?"
    m:
      - "What if she won’t kiss me?"

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter."
    m:
      - "Then she’s making you beg, and that gives you a whole new set of things to talk about."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?"
    m:
      - "Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves?"

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Marry, that should you if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit."
    m:
      - "Indeed, you would be out if I were your mistress—if my chastity is worth as much as my wit."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "What, of my suit?"
    m:
      - "Would I be out of my suit?"

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?"
    m:
      - "No, you’d still have your clothes on—but, yes, I wouldn’t think much of you. Aren’t I your Rosalind?"

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her."
    m:
      - "I like to pretend you are, because then it’s almost like actually talking to her."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Well, in her person I say I will not have you."
    m:
      - "Well, on behalf of Rosalind, I’ll tell you I don’t want you."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Then, in mine own person I die."
    m:
      - "Then, on behalf of myself, I’ll tell you I’ll die."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicet, in a love cause. Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night, for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and, being taken with the cramp, was drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies. Men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love."
    m:
      - "No, you won’t die yourself, but only by proxy. This world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love. Troilus may have wanted to die from love, and he’s now considered one of the great, tragic love heroes, but, in fact, a Greek with a club beat his brains out. It had nothing to do with love. Leander would have lived many more years if it hadn’t been for a particularly hot summer night, when he went swimming in the Hellespont, got a cramp, and drowned. The foolish poets of the time insisted he died for love, but they’re lying. All the love stories are lies. Men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not because of love."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frown might kill me."
    m:
      - "I hope Rosalind doesn’t feel as you do. Her frown alone would kill me."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come; now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I will grant it."
    m:
      - "No, her frown wouldn’t kill a fly. But come on, now I’ll play your Rosalind, and in a more friendly state of mind. Whatever you ask for, I’ll give."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Then love me, Rosalind."
    m:
      - "Then love me, Rosalind."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all."
    m:
      - "Okay, I will—on Fridays and Saturdays, and the rest."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "And wilt thou have me?"
    m:
      - "And will you have me?"

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Ay, and twenty such."
    m:
      - "Sure, and twenty others just like you."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "What sayest thou?"
    m:
      - "What’s that?"

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Are you not good?"
    m:
      - "Well, aren’t you a good man?"

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "I hope so."
    m:
      - "I hope so."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?— Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?"
    m:
      - "And can a person ever have too much of a good thing?—Come on, sister, you can be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?"

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Pray thee, marry us."
    m:
      - "Please, marry us."

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "I cannot say the words."
    m:
      - "I can’t say the words."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "You must begin “Will you, Orlando—”"
    m:
      - "You just have to say, “Do you, Orlando—”"

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "Go to.—Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?"
    m:
      - "Oh, stop it.—Do you, Orlando, take Rosalind to be your lawfully wedded wife?"

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "I will."
    m:
      - "I do."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Ay, but when?"
    m:
      - "Okay, but when?"

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Why, now, as fast as she can marry us."
    m:
      - "Right now; as fast as she can say the vows."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Then you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.”"
    m:
      - "Then you have to say, “I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.”"

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "I take thee, Rosalind, for wife."
    m:
      - "I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "I might ask you for your commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband. There’s a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a woman’s thought runs before her actions."
    m:
      - "Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me, but I’ll take you, Orlando, to be my husband. Look, I’ve sped ahead of the priest and answered the question before he even asked. A woman’s thoughts are always running ahead of her actions."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "So do all thoughts. They are winged."
    m:
      - "So do all thoughts. They have wings."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her."
    m:
      - "Now tell me how long you intend to keep her."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Forever and a day."
    m:
      - "Forever and a day."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Say “a day” without the “ever.” No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo, December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock- pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more newfangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry. I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou art inclined to sleep."
    m:
      - "You might as well just say for “a day,” and forget the “ever” part. No, Orlando, men are like April when they’re wooing a girl—young, and passionate—but like December once they’re married and their passions have cooled. Women are as sweet and temperate as springtime when they’re single, but the climate changes once they’re married. I’ll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain; more fond of new things than an ape; more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey. I’ll cry at nothing, and I’ll always do it when you’re in a good mood. And when you want to go to sleep, I’ll be up laughing like a hyena."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "But will my Rosalind do so?"
    m:
      - "But will my Rosalind do this, too?"

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "By my life, she will do as I do."
    m:
      - "Indeed, she’ll act just like me."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Oh, but she is wise."
    m:
      - "But she is wise."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the casement. Shut that, and ’twill out at the keyhole. Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney."
    m:
      - "Right. If she weren’t wise, she wouldn’t be smart enough to behave badly. The wiser the woman, the wilder. If you close the doors on a woman’s wit, it’ll fly out the window. If you shut the windows, it will pour out the keyhole. If you stop up the keyhole, it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say “Wit, whither wilt?”"
    m:
      - "A man with a wife like that might ask, “Hey, wandering wit, where are you off to?”"

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your wife’s wit going to your neighbor’s bed."
    m:
      - "Nah, better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor’s bed."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "And what wit could wit have to excuse that?"
    m:
      - "And what wit could excuse *that*?"

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue. Oh, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool."
    m:
      - "She’ll say she was at the neighbor’s looking for you. You’ll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue. A woman who doesn’t know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband’s fault is hardly a woman. And she’s hardly fit to be a mother—her child will turn out to be a fool."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee."
    m:
      - "Rosalind, I have to leave you for two hours."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours."
    m:
      - "Oh, no! Darling, I can’t live without you for two hours."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "I must attend the duke at dinner. By two o’clock I will be with thee again."
    m:
      - "I must join the duke for lunch. I’ll be back here with you by two o’clock."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would prove. My friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering tongue of yours won me. ’Tis but one cast away, and so, come, death. Two o’clock is your hour?"
    m:
      - "Oh, go, leave me. I knew you’d turn out this way. My friends told me as much, and I knew it, too. But I was won over by your flattering words. I’m just another girl whom you’ve cast aside. So, take me, death! You’ll be back at two o’clock?"

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Ay, sweet Rosalind."
    m:
      - "Yes, sweet Rosalind."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise."
    m:
      - "Honestly, truly, in God’s name, and by all those little girly oaths that don’t actually have any power, if you break even a little bit of your promise, or if you come even a minute after two o’clock, I’ll think you the most pathetic promise breaker, the most lying lover, and the most unworthy partner for Rosalind that could be found anywhere. So beware of my contempt, and keep your promise."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind."
      - "So, adieu."
    m:
      - "I’ll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind. So, goodbye."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Well, time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let time try. Adieu."
    m:
      - "Well, time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal. Time will tell what kind of a man you are. Goodbye."

  - os: "Exit ORLANDO"
    ms: "ORLANDO exits."

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate. We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest."
    m:
      - "You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours. We should rip off your man’s clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love. But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal."
    m:
      - "Oh cousin, cousin, cousin, my sweet little cousin, I wish you knew how deep in love I am. The bottom of my love is so deep it can’t be reached. It’s as deep as the bay of Portugal."

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "Or rather bottomless, that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out."
    m:
      - "Or it’s bottomless, at least: pour affection in one end, and it runs out the other."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love. I’ll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I’ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come."
    m:
      - "Cupid—that blind bastard son of Venus, conceived from a thought and anger, born from insanity, that blind, naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can’t see himself—let Cupid judge how deep my love runs. I’m telling you, Aliena, I can’t stand being apart from Orlando. I’m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns."

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "And I’ll sleep."
    m:
      - "And I’m going to sleep."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
