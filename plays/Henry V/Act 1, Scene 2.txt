    m:
      - "Thank you, I’m sure. My learned lord, kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this French Salic law either should or shouldn’t bar me in my claim. And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord, that you should invent, twist, or distort your interpretation, or burden your conscience by subtly arguing for false claims. For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do. So think carefully before you incite me to wage war. I charge you, in the name of God, be careful what you say. For mighty kingdoms such as England and France have never gone to war with one another without much bloodshed, every innocent drop of which cries out against the wrongdoer who caused such loss of life without good reason. With this in mind, speak, my lord. And I will listen, consider, and earnestly believe that what you say is spoken with a conscience as pure as a newly baptized soul."

      - "Was reunited to the crown of France."
      - "So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun,"
      - "King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim,"
      - "King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear"
      - "To hold in right and title of the female."
      - "So do the kings of France unto this day,"
      - "Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law"
      - "To bar your Highness claiming from the female"
      - "And rather choose to hide them in a net"
      - "Than amply to imbar their crooked titles"
      - "Usurped from you and your progenitors."
    m:
      - "Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne. There is no legal obstacle to your Highness’ claim to France except the following rule, which the French cite from King Pharamond: *In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant* (No woman shall inherit property in the Salic land). The French wrongly interpret “the Salic land” to mean France, and they cite Pharamond as the founder of this law that bars female succession to the throne. But their own authors assert that the Salic land is in Germany, between the Sala and the Elbe rivers, where Charles the Great left behind certain French settlements after conquering the Saxons. The French settlers despised the German women because they were unfaithful to their husbands, so the settlers passed this law that no woman should have right of inheritance in Salic land. And the Salic land—the region between the Elbe and the Sala, in Germany, as I said—is now called Meissen. It is clear, then, that the Salic law was not intended for the realm of France. Nor did the French possess the Salic land until four hundred twenty-one years after the death of King Pharamond, incorrectly thought to be the founder of the law. He died in the year 426, and Charles the Great conquered the Saxons and settled Frenchmen in the region beyond the river Sala in the year 805. Besides, according to the French historians, King Pepin, who deposed Childeric, based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild, the daughter of King Clothair. Another case: Hugh Capet, who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine—sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great—passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare, daughter of Charlemagne, who was the son of Lewis the Emperor (who was the son of Charles the Great), in order to give his claim to the throne more validity (though, in fact, the claim was completely false and worthless). Another case: King Lewis the Tenth, who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel, his grandmother, was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare, daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine, by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France. Thus, it should be clear as day that King Pepin’s title, Hugh Capet’s claim, and the resolution of King Lewis’ doubts all plainly derive from the female. To this day, the kings of France follow this unspoken rule, even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line. They prefer to obscure matters rather than reveal how corrupt their own claims to the French crown are. They usurped that crown from you and your ancestors."

    o:
      - "May I with right and conscience make this claim?"

      - "Can I justifiably and in good conscience make this claim?"

  - sp: CANTERBURY
    o:
      - "The sin upon my head, dread sovereign,"
      - "For in the Book of Numbers is it writ:"
      - "“When the man dies, let the inheritance"
      - "Descend unto the daughter.” Gracious lord,"
      - "Stand for your own, unwind your bloody flag,"
      - "Look back into your mighty ancestors."
      - "Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire’s tomb,"
      - "From whom you claim. Invoke his warlike spirit"
      - "And your great-uncle’s, Edward the Black Prince,"
      - "Who on the French ground played a tragedy,"
      - "Making defeat on the full power of France"
      - "Whiles his most mighty father on a hill"
      - "Stood smiling to behold his lion’s whelp"
      - "Forage in blood of French nobility."
      - "O noble English, that could entertain"
      - "With half their forces the full pride of France"
      - "And let another half stand laughing by,"
      - "All out of work and cold for action!"
    m:
      - "If not, mighty sovereign, let the blame be mine. For it is written in the book of Numbers: “When the man dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.” Gracious lord, claim what is yours. Unfurl your banners of war. Take your mighty ancestors as models. Go to the tomb of your great-grandfather, from whom your own title to the crown derives. Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince, your great-uncle, who fought a tragic battle on French soil, routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop, smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen. O noble English, who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces, leaving the other half to stand by, idle and laughing."

      - "Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises."
    m:
      - "Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again. You are their heir and sit on their throne, and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins. You, my most powerful sovereign, are in the very prime of youth, ripe for glorious deeds and great enterprises."

      - "And lie pavilioned in the fields of France."
    m:
      - "They know your Grace has justification, as well as the money and military strength. And so you do. No king of England was ever backed by wealthier nobles or more loyal subjects. Their bodies may remain here in England, but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already."

      - "As never did the clergy at one time"
      - "Bring in to any of your ancestors."
    m:
      - "Oh, let their bodies follow, my dear king, to win back what’s rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire. And to that end, we, the clergy, will raise your Highness a sum greater than your ancestors were ever given at any one time."

    o:

      - "But lay down our proportions to defend"
      - "Against the Scot, who will make road upon us"
      - "With all advantages."

      - "Shall be a wall sufficient to defend"
      - "Our inland from the pilfering borderers."

      - "Your subjects in the north, gracious sovereign, will provide a wall of defense against Scottish thieves across the border."

  - sp: KING HENRY
    o:
      - "We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,"
      - "But fear the main intendment of the Scot,"
      - "Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us."
      - "For you shall read that my great-grandfather"
      - "Never went with his forces into France"
      - "But that the Scot on his unfurnished kingdom"
      - "Came pouring like the tide into a breach"
      - "With ample and brim fullness of his force,"
      - "Galling the gleanèd land with hot assays,"
      - "Girding with grievous siege castles and towns,"
      - "That England, being empty of defense,"
      - "Hath shook and trembled at th’ ill neighborhood."
    m:
      - "I don’t mean merely bands of thieves. What we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from Scotland—always an unreliable neighbor. You’ll find that my great-grandfather never went to war with France without Scotland making an attack on his undefended kingdom, pouring in full force like the tide through a gap in a dyke, troubling the depleted country with violent attacks, and laying siege to towns and castles. The whole of England, being unprotected, trembled with fear."

  - sp: CANTERBURY
    o:
      - "She hath been then more feared than harmed, my liege,"
      - "For hear her but exampled by herself:"
      - "When all her chivalry hath been in France"
      - "And she a mourning widow of her nobles,"
      - "She hath herself not only well defended"
      - "But taken and impounded as a stray"
      - "The king of Scots, whom she did send to France"
      - "To fill King Edward’s fame with prisoner kings"
      - "And make her chronicle as rich with praise"
      - "As is the ooze and bottom of the sea"
      - "With sunken wrack and sumless treasuries."
    m:
      - "But the country was more frightened than hurt, my liege. Take this example: when all its knights have been in France and all its noblemen absent, England has not only defended itself well, but actually seized the Scottish king and penned him up like a stray dog. Then he was sent off to France. He enhanced King Edward’s fame, adding royalty to his captives and thus making England’s own history as rich with glory as the muddy floor of the sea is rich with sunken ships and innumerable treasures."

  - sp: ELY
    o:
      - "But there’s a saying very old and true:"
      - "“If that you will France win,"
      - "Then with Scotland first begin.”"
      - "For once the eagle England being in prey,"
      - "To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot"
      - "Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,"
      - "Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,"
      - "To ’tame and havoc more than she can eat."
    m:
      - "But here’s an old, true saying: “If you want to win France, start with Scotland.” For when the eagle England leaves her nest to seek prey, the weasel Scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and, like the mouse when the cat’s away, destroy more than she can actually eat."

  - sp: EXETER
    o:
      - "It follows, then, the cat must stay at home."
      - "Yet that is but a crushed necessity,"
      - "Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries"
      - "And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves."
      - "While that the armèd hand doth fight abroad,"
      - "Th’ advisèd head defends itself at home."
      - "For government, though high and low and lower,"
      - "Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,"
      - "Congreeing in a full and natural close,"
      - "Like music."
    m:
      - "It would follow from this that the cat should stay home. But that is a false conclusion, since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves. While the armed hand fights in foreign lands, the wise head defends itself at home. For though the state is divided into different levels and functions, it all works in agreement for a unified purpose, a natural and perfect end such as we find in music."

    o:
      - "  Therefore doth heaven divide"

      - "Who, busied in his majesty, surveys"
      - "The singing masons building roofs of gold,"
      - "The civil citizens kneading up the honey,"
      - "The poor mechanic porters crowding in"
      - "Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,"
      - "The sad-eyed justice with his surly hum"
      - "Delivering o’er to executors pale"
      - "The lazy yawning drone. I this infer:"
      - "That many things, having full reference"
      - "To one consent, may work contrariously,"
      - "As many arrows loosèd several ways"
      - "Come to one mark, as many ways meet in one town,"
      - "As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea,"
      - "As many lines close in the dial’s center,"
      - "So may a thousand actions, once afoot,"
      - "End in one purpose, and be all well borne"
      - "Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege!"
      - "Divide your happy England into four,"
      - "Whereof take you one quarter into France,"
      - "And you withal shall make all Gallia shake."
      - "If we, with thrice such powers left at home,"
      - "Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,"
      - "Let us be worried, and our nation lose"
      - "The name of hardiness and policy."
    m:
      - "That is why God divided humanity into various functions, so as to keep human endeavor moving ever forward, the one single fixed element—the aim—being obedience. Honey bees operate in just such a communal way. In fact, you can learn a lot about how to run a well-ordered kingdom from these creatures. They have a king and officers of sorts. Some, like magistrates, dole out punishment at home, while others venture forth for commerce, like merchants. Still others, armed like soldiers with stingers, pillage the summer flowers, bringing the booty triumphantly home to the royal tent of their emperor, who is preoccupied with governing. The emperor supervises the masons as they build gold roofs, the ordinary citizens as they process the honey, the humble laborers as they crowd through the city’s narrow gate with their heavy burdens, and the solemn-looking judge (with his grouchy hum) as he delivers lazy, unproductive drones to pale executioners. From this, I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end—just as many arrows, shot from different points, converge on a single target; just as many roads meet in a single town; just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea; just as the many radiuses of a sundial unite at its center. Just so, a thousand actions, once set in motion, will result in one desired object, and all will be well carried out and have a successful end. Therefore, head to France, my liege! Divide your lucky England into four. If you take even one quarter with you to France, you will nevertheless make the whole country shake. If we cannot defend our country with three times such a power left at home, then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation."

    o:
      - "Thus, then, in few:"
      - "Your Highness, lately sending into France,"
      - "Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right"
      - "Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third;"
      - "In answer of which claim, the prince our master"
      - "Says that you savor too much of your youth"
      - "And bids you be advised there’s naught in France"
      - "That can be with a nimble galliard won."
      - "You cannot revel into dukedoms there."
      - "He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,"
      - "This tun of treasure, and, in lieu of this,"
      - "Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim"
      - "Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks."
    m:
      - "Here it is then, in as few words as possible. Your Highness recently sent word to France claiming certain dukedoms as your own, in the name of your great ancestor, King Edward the Third. By way of answer, the prince our master says that you’re acting like the immature youth that you are. He warns you to take note: there’s nothing in France that you can win by dancing. You can’t party your way into dukedoms there. He therefore sends you this casket of treasure as a gift more suited to your character. And in return for this gift, he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms. This is the Dauphin’s message."

      - "That all the courts of France will be disturbed"

      - "So get you hence in peace. And tell the Dauphin"
      - "His jest will savor but of shallow wit"
      - "When thousands weep more than did laugh at it."
      - "—Convey them with safe conduct.—Fare you well."
    m:
      - "I’m happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor. Thank you for his present and your trouble. Once I’ve put my rackets to these balls, I’ll play a set in France, God willing, that will knock his father’s crown right out of the court. Tell him he’s got himself such a willing opponent that we’ll be chasing balls all over France. And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days. He doesn’t realize how useful they were to me. For a long time, I didn’t value this humble throne of England, and therefore lived at some remove and gave myself over to riotous living. Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they’re away from home. But tell the Dauphin I will retain the dignity of kingship and appear all the more royal and glorious on the throne of France. Precisely for this purpose I went about like a commoner and experienced the life of the ordinary man. Now I’ll rise there with such glory that I’ll dazzle all the eyes of France. I’ll shine so brightly that even the Dauphin will be struck blind. And tell the laughing prince that this joke of his has transformed his tennis balls into cannon balls, and the destructive vengeance they bring with them will be his responsibility. His mocking will mock many thousands of widows out of their husbands. It will mock mothers out of their sons, and mock castles down. There are people yet unborn and unconceived who will have reason to curse the Dauphin’s scorn. But all this lies with God, to whom I do appeal. In God’s name, inform the Dauphin I am coming, to avenge myself and to put forth my rightful hand in a sanctified cause. So go in peace. And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it. *(to attendants)* Give them safe conduct.—Farewell."

For, with God on our side, we’ll chastise this prince on his father’s own doorstep. Therefore, let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken."
