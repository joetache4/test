<p>The blessed gods</p>
<p>Purge all infection from our air whilst you</p>
<p>Do climate here! You have a holy father,</p>
<p>A graceful gentleman; against whose person,</p>
<p>So sacred as it is, I have done sin:</p>
<p>For which the heavens, taking angry note,</p>
<p>Have left me issueless; and your father’s blest,</p>
<p>As he from heaven merits it, with you</p>
<p>Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,</p>
<p>Might I a son and daughter now have look’d on,</p>
<p>Such goodly things as you!</p>

<p>May the gods keep the air fresh and healthy while you are here! You have a great and graceful father, against whom I have committed a sin. In return, the angry heavens have left me childless, while your father is blessed by heaven with you, as he deserves. What might my life have been like if I had a son and daughter as lovely as you two to look at!</p>

<b>LORD</b>
<p>Most noble sir, if I didn’t have such firm proof you wouldn’t believe what I’m about to tell you. Sir, Polixenes himself greets you through me. He asks you to hold his son, who has abandoned his royal status and responsibilities, and who has fled from his father and his hope of the throne with a shepherd’s daughter.</p>
