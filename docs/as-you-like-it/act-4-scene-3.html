<p>And mark what object did present itself:</p>
<p>Under an old oak, whose boughs were mossed with age</p>
<p>And high top bald with dry antiquity,</p>
<p>A wretched, ragged man, o’ergrown with hair,</p>
<p>Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck</p>
<p>A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,</p>
<p>Who with her head, nimble in threats, approached</p>
<p>The opening of his mouth. But suddenly,</p>
<p>Seeing Orlando, it unlinked itself</p>
<p>And, with indented glides, did slip away</p>
<p>Into a bush, under which bush’s shade</p>
<p>A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,</p>
<p>Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch</p>
<p>When that the sleeping man should stir—for ’tis</p>
<p>The royal disposition of that beast</p>
<p>To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.</p>

<p>When young Orlando left you last, he promised to return within an hour. He was pacing through the forest, thinking bittersweet thoughts of love, and listen what happened! He looked to the side, and pay attention to what he saw then: under an oak tree—whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle—he saw a wretched beggar, with overgrown hair and beard, asleep on his back. A green and gold snake had wound itself around this man’s neck and was slowly making its way toward the man’s mouth. However, when it saw Orlando, it unwound itself and slunk away into a bush. But there happened to be a lioness crouching under that bush. Her cubs had nursed from her until she was dry, so she was ravenously hungry, and she was lying with her head on the ground, watching the man as cats do and waiting to see if he would wake up—a lion won’t prey on anything that seems dead. Seeing the lioness, Orlando approached the sleeping man. He discovered that the man was his older brother.</p>
