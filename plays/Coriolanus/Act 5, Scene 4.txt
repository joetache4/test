  - os: "Rome. A public place."
    ms: "A public place in Rome."

  - os: "Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS"
    ms: "MENENIUS and SICINIUS enter."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "See you yond coign o’ the Capitol, yond"
      - "corner-stone?"
    m:
      - "Do you see, beyond the corner of the capitol, beyond the cornerstone?"

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Why, what of that?"
    m:
      - "What is that?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "If it be possible for you to displace it with your"
      - "little finger, there is some hope the ladies of"
      - "Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him."
      - "But I say there is no hope in’t: our throats are"
      - "sentenced and stay upon execution."
    m:
      - "If you can block it with your little finger, there is some hope that the ladies of Rome, especially his mother, might prevail with him. But I don’t think there is any hope. Our fate is sealed. Our throats wait to be slit."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Is’t possible that so short a time can alter the"
      - "condition of a man!"
    m:
      - "Is it possible that a man can change so much in so short a time?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;"
      - "yet your butterfly was a grub. This Martius is grown"
      - "from man to dragon: he has wings; he’s more than a"
      - "creeping thing."
    m:
      - "There’s a difference between a caterpillar and a butterfly, but butterflies were once caterpillars. This Martius has grown from man to dragon: he has wings—he’s more than a creeping thing."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "He loved his mother dearly."
    m:
      - "He loved his mother dearly."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother"
      - "now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness"
      - "of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he"
      - "moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before"
      - "his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with"
      - "his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a"
      - "battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for"
      - "Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with"
      - "his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity"
      - "and a heaven to throne in."
    m:
      - "He also loved me. He won’t remember his mother any more than an eight-year-old horse would. The tartness of his face makes ripe grapes go sour. When he walks, he moves like a war machine, and the ground sinks beneath his feet. He’s able to pierce armor with his eye, he talks like a death knell, and his voice itself is an assault. He sits on his throne, looking like a statue of Alexander the Great. His orders are carried out as soon as he gives them. All that he lacks to be a god is immortality and a heaven to rule."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Yes, mercy, if you report him truly."
    m:
      - "He lacks the mercy of a god, if you’re telling the truth."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his"
      - "mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy"
      - "in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that"
      - "shall our poor city find: and all this is long of"
      - "you."
    m:
      - "I’m giving a sketch of his character. Let’s see how much mercy his mother gets out of him. There’s no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger. Our poor city will soon find this out, and it’s all because of you."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "The gods be good unto us!"
    m:
      - "May the gods be good to us!"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto"
      - "us. When we banished him, we respected not them;"
      - "and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us."
    m:
      - "No, in this case the gods won’t be good to us. When we banished him, we dishonored them. And now he’s returning to break our necks, which shows that they don’t respect us."

  - os: "Enter a Messenger"
    ms: "A Messenger enters."

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "Sir, if you’ld save your life, fly to your house:"
      - "The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune"
      - "And hale him up and down, all swearing, if"
      - "The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,"
      - "They’ll give him death by inches."
    m:
      - "Sir, if you want to save your life, go home immediately. The people have taken custody of your fellow tribune and are hauling him up and down the street, all swearing that if the Roman ladies don’t return with a peaceful resolution, they’ll torture him to death."

  - os: "Enter a second Messenger"
    ms: "A second Messenger enters."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "What’s the news?"
    m:
      - "What’s the news?"

  - sp: SECOND MESSENGER
    o:
      - "Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail’d,"
      - "The Volscians are dislodged, and Martius gone:"
      - "A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,"
      - "No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins."
    m:
      - "Good news, good news! The ladies have prevailed, the Volsces have retreated, and Martius is gone! Rome has never had a happier day. Not even the expulsion of the Tarquins tops this."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Friend,"
      - "Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?"
    m:
      - "Friend, are you certain this is true? Is it absolutely certain?"

  - sp: SECOND MESSENGER
    o:
      - "As certain as I know the sun is fire:"
      - "Where have you lurk’d, that you make doubt of it?"
      - "Ne’er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,"
      - "As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!"
    m:
      - "As certain as I know the sun is fire. Where have you been that you doubt it? The tide has never blown more quickly through an arch as this reassuring news has blown through the gates. Why, look here!"

  - os: "Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together"
    ms: "Trumpets and pipes sound, drums beat, all together."

  - o:
      - "The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,"
      - "Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,"
      - "Make the sun dance. Hark you!"
    m:
      - "The trumpets, trombones, strings and pipes, drums and cymbals, and the shouting Romans sparkle in the sun. Listen!"

  - os: "A shout within"
    ms: "A shout comes from offstage."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "This is good news:"
      - "I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia"
      - "Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,"
      - "A city full; of tribunes, such as you,"
      - "A sea and land full. You have pray’d well to-day:"
      - "This morning for ten thousand of your throats"
      - "I’d not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!"
    m:
      - "This is good news. I’ll go meet the ladies. This Volumnia is worth of a city full of consuls, senators, and patricians, and she’s worth a sea and land full of tribunes. You have prayed well today. This morning I thought the chance that you’d live was one in ten thousand. Look how happy they are!"
