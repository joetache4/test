<p>Mine eye hath played the painter and hath steeled</p>
<p>Thy beauty’s form in table of my heart.</p>
<p>My body is the frame wherein ’tis held,</p>
<p>And pérspective it is best painter’s art.</p>
<p>For through the painter must you see his skill</p>
<p>To find where your true image pictured lies,</p>
<p>Which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,</p>
<p>That hath his windows glazèd with thine eyes.</p>
<p>Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:</p>
<p>Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me</p>
<p>Are windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun</p>
<p>Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee.</p>
<p>Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;</p>
<p>They draw but what they see, know not the heart.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<p>My eye has acted like a painter and engraved your beautiful image on the canvas of my heart. My body is the frame that holds this picture; to draw that picture with perspective, realistically representing depth, is the highest skill a painter could have. Only via this painter—my eye—can you find the image of you that dwells continually in my heart: Your own eyes are the windows into my heart. Now look at the favors our eyes have done for each other: My eyes have drawn your shape, and your eyes are windows into which I can look to see my own heart, into which the sun also likes to look, taking a peep at your reflection. Yet my eyes lack a certain skill that would grace the others they already have: They can only draw what they see; they don’t see into your heart.</p>
