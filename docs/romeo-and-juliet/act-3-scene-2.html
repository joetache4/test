<b>JULIET</b>
<p>Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,</p>
<p>Toward Phoebus’ lodging. Such a wagoner</p>
<p>As Phaeton would whip you to the west</p>
<p>And bring in cloudy night immediately.</p>
<p>Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,</p>
<p>That runaways’ eyes may wink, and Romeo</p>
<p>Leap to these arms, untalked of and unseen.</p>
<p>Lovers can see to do their amorous rites</p>
<p>By their own beauties, or, if love be blind,</p>
<p>It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,</p>
<p>Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,</p>
<p>And learn me how to lose a winning match</p>
<p>Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.</p>
<p>Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks,</p>
<p>With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,</p>
<p>Think true love acted simple modesty.</p>
<p>Come, night. Come, Romeo. Come, thou day in night,</p>
<p>For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night</p>
<p>Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.</p>
<p>Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-browed night,</p>
<p>Give me my Romeo. And when I shall die,</p>
<p>Take him and cut him out in little stars,</p>
<p>And he will make the face of heaven so fine</p>
<p>That all the world will be in love with night</p>
<p>And pay no worship to the garish sun.</p>
<p>Oh, I have bought the mansion of a love,</p>
<p>But not possessed it, and though I am sold,</p>
<p>Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day</p>
<p>As is the night before some festival</p>
<p>To an impatient child that hath new robes</p>
<p>And may not wear them.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>JULIET</b>
<p>I wish the sun would hurry up and set and night would come immediately. When the night comes and everyone goes to sleep, Romeo will leap into my arms, and no one will know. Beauty makes it possible for lovers to see how to make love in the dark. Or else love is blind, and its best time is the night. I wish night would come, like a widow dressed in black, so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity. Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed. In the darkness, let me, a shy virgin, learn the strange act of sex so that it seems innocent, modest, and true. Come, night. Come, Romeo. You’re like a day that comes during the night. You’re whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven. Come, gentle night. Come, loving, dark night. Give me my Romeo. And when I die, turn him into stars and form a constellation in his image. His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun. Oh, I have bought love’s mansion, but I haven’t moved in yet.I belong to Romeo now, but he hasn’t taken possession of me yet. This day is so boring that I feel like a child on the night before a holiday, waiting to put on my fancy new clothes.</p>

He’s a villain who seemed honorable. Oh nature, what were you doing in hell? Why did you put the soul of a criminal in the perfect body of a man?

<p>“Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banishèd.”</p>
<p>That “banishèd,” that one word “banishèd”</p>

<p>Was woe enough, if it had ended there.</p>
<p>Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship</p>

<p>“Romeo is banishèd.” To speak that word,</p>
<p>Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,</p>
<p>All slain, all dead. “Romeo is banishèd.”</p>

<b>JULIET</b>
<p>Am I supposed to say bad things about my own husband? Ah, my poor husband, who will sing your praises when I, your wife of three hours, have been saying awful things about you? But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin? Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband. I’m not going to cry any tears. I would cry with joy that Romeo is alive, but I should cry tears of grief because Tybalt is dead. My husband, whom Tybalt wanted to kill, is alive. Tybalt, who wanted to kill my husband, is dead. All this is comforting news. Why, then, should I cry? There is news worse than the news that Tybalt is dead, news that makes me want to die. I would be glad to forget about it, but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds. “Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.” That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death would be bad enough if that was all. Maybe pain likes to have company and can’t come without bringing more pain. It would have been better if, after she said, “Tybalt’s dead,” she told me my mother or my father, or both, were gone. That would have made me make the normal cries of sadness. But to say that Tybalt’s dead and then say, “Romeo has been banished.” To say that is like saying that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet have all been killed, they’re all dead. “Romeo has been banished.” That news brings infinite death. No words can express the pain. Where are my father and my mother, Nurse?</p>
