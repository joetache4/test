  - os: "Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome. Two Sentinels on guard."
    ms: "An advanced post of the Volscian camp, outside Rome. Two guards at their station."

  - os: "Enter to them, MENENIUS"
    ms: "MENENIUS enters."

  - sp: FIRST SENTINEL
    o:
      - "Stay: whence are you?"
    m:
      - "Stop there. Who are you?"

  - sp: SECOND SENTINEL
    o:
      - "Stand, and go back."
    m:
      - "Stop and go back."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "You guard like men; ’tis well: but, by your leave,"
      - "I am an officer of state, and come"
      - "To speak with Coriolanus."
    m:
      - "You’re good guards, but I assure you that I’m an officer of the state, and I’ve come to speak with Coriolanus."

  - sp: FIRST SENTINEL
    o:
      - "From whence?"
    m:
      - "Where are you from?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "From Rome."
    m:
      - "From Rome."

  - sp: FIRST SENTINEL
    o:
      - "You may not pass, you must return: our general"
      - "Will no more hear from thence."
    m:
      - "You may not pass. You must return. Our general won’t listen to Romans anymore."

  - sp: SECOND SENTINEL
    o:
      - "You’ll see your Rome embraced with fire before"
      - "You’ll speak with Coriolanus."
    m:
      - "You’ll see your Rome consumed with fire before you’ll speak with Coriolanus."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Good my friends,"
      - "If you have heard your general talk of Rome,"
      - "And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,"
      - "My name hath touch’d your ears. It is Menenius."
    m:
      - "Good men, if you’ve heard your general talk of Rome and of his friends there, you’ve undoubtedly heard my name: Menenius."

  - sp: FIRST SENTINEL
    o:
      - "Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name"
      - "Is not here passable."
    m:
      - "Even if that’s true, go back. You can’t get in here by virtue of your name."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "I tell thee, fellow,"
      - "The general is my lover: I have been"
      - "The book of his good acts, whence men have read"
      - "His name unparallel’d, haply amplified;"
      - "For I have ever verified my friends,"
      - "Of whom he’s chief, with all the size that verity"
      - "Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,"
      - "Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,"
      - "I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise"
      - "Have almost stamp’d the leasing: therefore, fellow,"
      - "I must have leave to pass."
    m:
      - "I tell you, fellow, the general is my close friend. I’ve recorded his brave acts and proclaimed, perhaps exaggeratedly, his greatness as unparalleled. I’ve always supported my friends, of whom he’s the closest, with the highest possible praise I could give without slipping into lies. Although it’s true that sometimes, like bowling on an uneven surface, I’ve thrown the ball too far and nearly praised him beyond his actual accomplishments. So you see, fellow, you must let me pass."

  - sp: FIRST SENTINEL
    o:
      - "Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his"
      - "behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you"
      - "should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous"
      - "to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back."
    m:
      - "Sir, if you’ve told as many lies on his behalf as you’ve spoken words that benefit yourself, you should not pass here. You act as if it were as virtuous to lie as it is to live honestly. Go back."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,"
      - "always factionary on the party of your general."
    m:
      - "Please, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, and I’ve always been on your general’s side."

  - sp: SECOND SENTINEL
    o:
      - "Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you"
      - "have, I am one that, telling true under him, must"
      - "say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back."
    m:
      - "Even if you’ve lied for him, as you say you have, I must follow his orders truthfully and say that you cannot pass. So go back."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not"
      - "speak with him till after dinner."
    m:
      - "Has he eaten yet, could you tell me? Because I wouldn’t want to speak with him until after dinner."

  - sp: FIRST SENTINEL
    o:
      - "You are a Roman, are you?"
    m:
      - "You’re a Roman, are you?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "I am, as thy general is."
    m:
      - "I am, just as your general is."

  - sp: FIRST SENTINEL
    o:
      - "Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,"
      - "when you have pushed out your gates the very"
      - "defender of them, and, in a violent popular"
      - "ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to"
      - "front his revenges with the easy groans of old"
      - "women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with"
      - "the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as"
      - "you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the"
      - "intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with"
      - "such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;"
      - "therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your"
      - "execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn"
      - "you out of reprieve and pardon."
    m:
      - "Then you should hate Rome the way he does. You’ve banished your greatest hero from your gates and, in a violent popular ignorance, given your best defender to your enemy. So how can you think to counteract his plan for revenge with the meaningless groans of old women, the prayers of your virgin daughters, or the crippled pleas of a decayed, senile old man such as yourself? You think you can blow out the fire that is about to engulf your city in flames with such weak breath as this? If so, you’re mistaken. Go back to Rome and prepare for your execution. You’re condemned, and our general has sworn to grant you no reprieve or pardon."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would"
      - "use me with estimation."
    m:
      - "Sirs, if your captain knew that I were here, he would treat me with respect."

  - sp: SECOND SENTINEL
    o:
      - "Come, my captain knows you not."
    m:
      - "Come, my captain doesn’t know you."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "I mean, thy general."
    m:
      - "I mean, your general."

  - sp: FIRST SENTINEL
    o:
      - "My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest"
      - "I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,—that’s"
      - "the utmost of your having: back."
    m:
      - "My general doesn’t care about you. Go back, I say, before I spill a half pint of your blood. Back, this is as far you get. Back!"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Nay, but, fellow, fellow,—"
    m:
      - "No, but, fellow, fellow—"

  - os: "Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS"
    ms: "CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS enter."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "What’s the matter?"
    m:
      - "What’s going on?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Now, you companion, I’ll say an errand for you:"
      - "You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall"
      - "perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from"
      - "my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment"
      - "with him, if thou standest not i’ the state of"
      - "hanging, or of some death more long in"
      - "spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now"
      - "presently, and swoon for what’s to come upon thee."
    m:
      - "Now, you fellow, I’ll give my version of what just happened here. You’ll know now that I’m well regarded by your general and that a lowly guard such as yourself can’t keep me from Coriolanus, he who is like a son to me. I wonder if after I talk with him, whether you’ll be hanged or killed more cruelly in some prolonged and public way. Watch now and worry for what’s going to happen to you."

  - os: "To CORIOLANUS"
    ms: "To CORIOLANUS"

  - o:
      - "The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy"
      - "particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than"
      - "thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!"
      - "thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here’s"
      - "water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to"
      - "thee; but being assured none but myself could move"
      - "thee, I have been blown out of your gates with"
      - "sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy"
      - "petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy"
      - "wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet"
      - "here,—this, who, like a block, hath denied my"
      - "access to thee."
    m:
      - "The glorious gods sit in hourly discussions about your personal prosperity, and they love you no less than your old father Menenius does! Oh, my son, my son! You’re preparing fire for us. Look, here’s water to quench it. I was grudgingly persuaded to come to you, but because they assured me that no one other than myself could convince you, I’ve been sent here from the gates with sighs and beg you to pardon Rome and your pleading countrymen. May the good gods calm your anger and turn the remains of it upon this villain here, who, like a block, has kept me from seeing you."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Away!"
    m:
      - "Away!"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "How! away!"
    m:
      - "What do you mean, away?"

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs"
      - "Are servanted to others: though I owe"
      - "My revenge properly, my remission lies"
      - "In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,"
      - "Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather"
      - "Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone."
      - "Mine ears against your suits are stronger than"
      - "Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,"
      - "Take this along; I writ it for thy sake"
    m:
      - "I have neither wife, nor mother, nor child. My personal life is now eclipsed by other matters. Though I seek my own revenge, the power to pardon belongs to the Volsces. We had a friendship, but your ungrateful failure to defend me has poisoned it. Pity will not remind me of what great friends we used to be. So go away. My ears rebuff your pleas with greater force than your gates will have against my army.  But because I did care for you, take this. I wrote it for your sake."

  - os: "Gives a letter"
    ms: "He gives Menenius a letter."

  - o:
      - "And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,"
      - "I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,"
      - "Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold’st!"
    m:
      - "And would have sent it. I won’t hear you speak another word, Menenius. This man was my dearest friend in Rome, Aufidius. But look at him!"

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "You keep a constant temper."
    m:
      - "You never change."

  - os: "Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS"
    ms: "CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS exit."

  - sp: FIRST SENTINEL
    o:
      - "Now, sir, is your name Menenius?"
    m:
      - "Now, sir, is your name Menenius?"

  - sp: SECOND SENTINEL
    o:
      - "’Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the"
      - "way home again."
    m:
      - "You see, it’s like a spell with great power. You know the way home again."

  - sp: FIRST SENTINEL
    o:
      - "Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your"
      - "greatness back?"
    m:
      - "Did you hear how they scolded us for keeping your greatness back?"

  - sp: SECOND SENTINEL
    o:
      - "What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?"
    m:
      - "Why, do you think, I swoon?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "I neither care for the world nor your general: for"
      - "such things as you, I can scarce think there’s any,"
      - "ye’re so slight. He that hath a will to die by"
      - "himself fears it not from another: let your general"
      - "do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and"
      - "your misery increase with your age! I say to you,"
      - "as I was said to, Away!"
    m:
      - "I don’t care about the world or about your general. I can barely think of things such as yourselves, you’re so insignificant. A suicidal man doesn’t fear being killed by someone else. Let your general do his worst. May you live long and may your misery increase with age! I say to you what was said to me: Away!"

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "Exit"

  - sp: FIRST SENTINEL
    o:
      - "A noble fellow, I warrant him."
    m:
      - "He’s a noble fellow, I say."

  - sp: SECOND SENTINEL
    o:
      - "The worthy fellow is our general: he’s the rock, the"
      - "oak not to be wind-shaken."
    m:
      - "The worthy fellow is our general. He’s like a rock or an oak that the wind can’t shake."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
