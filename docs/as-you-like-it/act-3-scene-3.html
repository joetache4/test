<p>Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt, for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage. As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, “Many a man knows no end of his goods.” Right: many a man has good horns and knows no end of them.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>TOUCHSTONE</b>
<p>Amen. You know, some men, who have fear in their hearts, might falter at this point. After all, these woods aren’t a proper church, and there’s no congregation here but horned animals. But who cares? I’ll be brave. Horns may be hateful, but they’re also necessary. They say, “Many a man doesn’t know the full extent of what he owns.” Exactly: many a man will see no end to the horns his wife furnishes him with.</p>

<td class="left">
<p>Well, that is the dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no. The noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No. As a walled town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor. And by how much defense is better than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to want.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<p>Well, that’s what the wife brings to the marriage. He didn’t do anything to get them. Horns? Well, there they are. Only for poor men? No, no. The nobleman’s are as huge as the underfed villager’s. Is the single man lucky, then? No. Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village, a married man’s horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor’s bare forehead. Just as it’s better to be skilled at self-defense than it is to avoid fighting, it’s better to risk a horn by marrying. Here comes Sir Oliver.</p>
