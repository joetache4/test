    ms: "The KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, Sir Walter BLUNT and others enter."

  - sp: KING
    o:
      - "My blood hath been too cold and temperate,"
      - "Unapt to stir at these indignities,"
      - "And you have found me, for accordingly"
      - "You tread upon my patience. But be sure"
      - "I will from henceforth rather be myself,"
      - "Mighty and to be feared, than my condition,"
      - "Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,"
      - "And therefore lost that title of respect"
      - "Which the proud soul ne’er pays but to the proud."
    m:
      - "I’ve been too calm and even-tempered, unwilling to react angrily to these indignities. You have discovered this, and so you’ve walked all over my patience. Know this: from now on, I’m going to be my royal self again, powerful and frightening. My natural condition, which was as smooth as oil and soft as feathers, has lost me the respect that powerful people only pay to the similarly powerful."

  - sp: WORCESTER
    o:
      - "Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves"
      - "The scourge of greatness to be used on it,"
      - "And that same greatness too which our own hands"
      - "Have holp to make so portly."
    m:
      - "My lord, the Percy family does not deserve to bear the brunt of your anger and power, especially since we helped you become so powerful in the first place."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "  My lord—"
    m:
      - "Your Highness —"

  - sp: KING
    o:
      - "Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see"
      - "Danger and disobedience in thine eye."
      - "O sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,"
      - "And majesty might never yet endure"
      - "The moody frontier of a servant brow."
      - "You have good leave to leave us. When we need"
      - "Your use and counsel, we shall send for you."
    m:
      - "Worcester, get out. I see danger and disobedience in your eyes. You carry yourself too boldly and proudly, and royalty should never have to endure a servant’s frowning face. You have my permission to leave now. When I need you or your advice, I’ll call for you."

  - os: "Exit WORCESTER"
    ms: "WORCESTER exits."

  - o:
      - "*(to NORTHUMBERLAND)* You were about to speak."
    m:
      - "*(to NORTHUMBERLAND)* You were about to speak."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "  Yea, my good lord."
      - "Those prisoners in your Highness’ name demanded,"
      - "Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,"
      - "Were, as he says, not with such strength denied"
      - "As is delivered to your Majesty:"
      - "Either envy, therefore, or misprison"
      - "Is guilty of this fault, and not my son."
    m:
      - "Yes, my Lord. The prisoners you asked for, which my son Harry Percy captured at Holmedon, were not kept from you in anger. He’s already told you that. Whoever told you my son meant to defy you was either mistaken or trying to make trouble. He’s done nothing wrong."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "My liege, I did deny no prisoners."
      - "But I remember, when the fight was done,"
      - "When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,"
      - "Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,"
      - "Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dressed,"
      - "Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reaped"
      - "Showed like a stubble land at harvest home."
      - "He was perfumèd like a milliner,"
      - "And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held"
      - "A pouncet box, which ever and anon"
      - "He gave his nose and took ’t away again,"
      - "Who therewith angry, when it next came there,"
      - "Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talked."
      - "And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,"
      - "He called them untaught knaves, unmannerly,"
      - "To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse"
      - "Betwixt the wind and his nobility."
      - "With many holiday and lady terms"
      - "He questioned me; amongst the rest demanded"
      - "My prisoners in your Majesty’s behalf."
      - "I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,"
      - "To be so pestered with a popinjay,"
      - "Out of my grief and my impatience"
      - "Answered neglectingly I know not what—"
      - "He should, or he should not; for he made me mad"
      - "To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet"
      - "And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman"
      - "Of guns, and drums, and wounds—God save the mark!—"
      - "And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth"
      - "Was parmacety for an inward bruise,"
      - "And that it was great pity, so it was,"
      - "This villanous saltpeter should be digged"
      - "Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,"
      - "Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed"
      - "So cowardly, and but for these vile guns"
      - "He would himself have been a soldier."
      - "This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,"
      - "I answered indirectly, as I said,"
      - "And I beseech you, let not his report"
      - "Come current for an accusation"
      - "Betwixt my love and your high Majesty."
    m:
      - "Sir, I didn’t hold back any prisoners. But I remember this: when the battle ended, I was exhausted with rage and exertion. I was out of breath, dizzy and bent over. All of a sudden a man approached me, neat, clean, and tidily dressed, like a bridegroom. His beard was freshly shaven, like a newly plowed field. He wore fancy cologne and he carried a perfume box, which he kept raising to his nose as he smiled and talked on. Whenever soldiers walked past, bearing dead bodies, he called them rude hoodlums for bringing a foul, disgusting corpse within breathing distance of him. He interrogated me, with his fancy language, and demanded that I give him my prisoners, to be taken on your behalf. There I was, with the cold aggravating all my wounds, being pestered by this idiot. In my grief and impatience, I gave him some kind of answer. I don’t even remember what I said—he could take them, or he couldn’t. I was so angry, looking at him all shiny and sweet-smelling, and speaking like a squeamish woman about guns and battle drums and wounds—God almighty! —and telling me the best thing for an injury is parmaceti, and that it was a shame that the blameless earth had to be dug up to find saltpeter for the gunpowder, when so many good, brave men had been cowardly destroyed by guns, and that if it hadn’t been for those disgusting guns, he would have been a soldier himself. All this trivial, incoherent talk I answered offhandedly, as I’ve already told you. So I beg you: please don’t take his word as evidence that there’s anything wrong between you and me, your Majesty."

  - sp: BLUNT
    o:
      - "The circumstance considered, good my lord,"
      - "Whate’er Lord Harry Percy then had said"
      - "To such a person and in such a place,"
      - "At such a time, with all the rest retold,"
      - "May reasonably die and never rise"
      - "To do him wrong or any way impeach"
      - "What then he said, so he unsay it now."
    m:
      - "Given the circumstances, my lord, whatever Harry Percy may have said to a man like that, in a place and time like that, should be allowed to die and never be spoken of again. It should never be used against Harry in any way, since he has taken it all back now."

  - sp: KING
    o:
      - "Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,"
      - "But with proviso and exception"
      - "That we at our own charge shall ransom straight"
      - "His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,"
      - "Who, on my soul, hath willfully betrayed"
      - "The lives of those that he did lead to fight"
      - "Against that great magician, damned Glendower,"
      - "Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March"
      - "Hath lately married. Shall our coffers then"
      - "Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?"
      - "Shall we buy treason and indent with fears"
      - "When they have lost and forfeited themselves?"
      - "No, on the barren mountains let him starve,"
      - "For I shall never hold that man my friend"
      - "Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost"
      - "To ransom home revolted Mortimer."
    m:
      - "But he still won’t turn over his prisoners unless he can add these stipulations and exceptions. He wants me, at my own cost, to pay ransom for his brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer, a man who, on my life, willfully betrayed his own men, whom he had led in fighting against that great magician, the damned Glendower. And now we hear that Mortimer has married Glendower’s daughter! Should the treasury be emptied to ransom a traitor? Should I pay for treason, and bargain for a coward, when it was Mortimer who lost himself? No. Let him starve in the wilderness. No man who asks me to spend one penny on that traitor Mortimer can ever be a friend of mine."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "Revolted Mortimer!"
      - "He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,"
      - "But by the chance of war. To prove that true"
      - "Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,"
      - "Those mouthèd wounds, which valiantly he took"
      - "When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank"
      - "In single opposition hand to hand"
      - "He did confound the best part of an hour"
      - "In changing hardiment with great Glendower."
      - "Three times they breathed, and three times did they drink,"
      - "Upon agreement, of swift Severn’s flood,"
      - "Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,"
      - "Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds"
      - "And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,"
      - "Bloodstainèd with these valiant combatants."
      - "Never did bare and rotten policy"
      - "Color her working with such deadly wounds,"
      - "Nor could the noble Mortimer"
      - "Receive so many, and all willingly."
      - "Then let not him be slandered with revolt."
    m:
      - "“That traitor Mortimer!” He never faltered, my lord, except through an accident of war. I’ll prove it, by speaking about the many wounds he heroically suffered when he spent an hour in brutal hand-to-hand combat against Glendower on the grassy banks of the Severn River. They broke three times from fighting, and they drank three times from the Severn. The river itself was frightened by their horrible looks. Its water became discolored with the blood of these brave fighters, and the Severn ran off, as if to hide itself in the weeds on its banks. Treachery has never used deadly wounds to cover its operations, and Mortimer could never have willingly suffered so many injuries. Do not let him be slandered by calling him a traitor."

  - sp: KING
    o:
      - "Thou dost belie him, Percy; thou dost belie him."
      - "He never did encounter with Glendower."
      - "I tell thee, he durst as well have met the devil alone"
      - "As Owen Glendower for an enemy."
      - "Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth"
      - "Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer."
      - "Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,"
      - "Or you shall hear in such a kind from me"
      - "As will displease you.—My lord Northumberland,"
      - "We license your departure with your son.—"
      - "Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it."
    m:
      - "You speak wrongly about him, Percy, you speak wrongly! He never fought Glendower. I tell you, he would just as soon dare to meet the devil himself as fight Glendower. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? Don’t ever let me hear you speak of Mortimer again. Send me your prisoners as quickly as possible, or you’ll hear about it from me, and you won’t like what I have to say. Northumberland, I give you and your son permission to leave now. Send your prisoners, or you’ll hear about it."

  - os: "Exit KING Henry, BLUNT, and train"
    ms: "KING Henry, BLUNT, and the attendants exit."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "An if the devil come and roar for them,"
      - "I will not send them. I will after straight"
      - "And tell him so, for I will ease my heart,"
      - "Albeit I make a hazard of my head."
    m:
      - "Even if the devil himself comes screaming for them, I won’t send those prisoners. I’m going to go after him and tell him so; it will ease my heart, though it might cost me my head."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile."
      - "Here comes your uncle."
    m:

  - os: "Enter WORCESTER"
    ms: "WORCESTER enters."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "  Speak of Mortimer?"
      - "Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul"
      - "Want mercy if I do not join with him."
      - "Yea, on his part I’ll empty all these veins"
      - "And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,"
      - "But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer"
      - "As high in the air as this unthankful King,"
      - "As this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke."
    m:
      - "Talk about Mortimer? God damn, I will talk about him. And damn my soul if I don’t join him! I’ll empty out my veins for him, and I’ll pour my precious blood onto the ground, drop by drop! And I’ll lift this put-upon Mortimer as high up as this ungrateful King, this ungenerous, rotten Bolingbroke!"

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "*(to WORCESTER)* Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad."
    m:
      - "*(toWORCESTER)* Brother, the King’s driven your nephew crazy."

  - sp: WORCESTER
    o:
      - "Who struck this heat up after I was gone?"
    m:
      - "Who started this trouble after I left?"

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "He will forsooth have all my prisoners,"
      - "And when I urged the ransom once again"
      - "Of my wife’s brother, then his cheek looked pale,"
      - "And on my face he turned an eye of death,"
      - "Trembling even at the name of Mortimer."
    m:
      - "He wants all my prisoners, for God’s sake! And when I asked again for him to ransom my brother-in-law, he looked pale, and he shot me a look that could kill. Just the mention of Mortimer’s name makes him shake."

  - sp: WORCESTER
    o:
      - "I cannot blame him. Was not he proclaimed"
      - "By Richard, that dead is, the next of blood?"
    m:
      - "I don’t blame him. Didn’t the late King Richard II proclaim that Mortimer should be next in line for the throne?"

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "He was; I heard the proclamation."
      - "And then it was when the unhappy King—"
      - "Whose wrongs in us God pardon!—did set forth"
      - "Upon his Irish expedition;"
      - "From whence he, intercepted, did return"
      - "To be deposed and shortly murderèd."
    m:
      - "He did; I heard the proclamation. That was when the wretched King Richard (may God forgive us for wronging him!) set out to invade Ireland. When that was interrupted, he returned to England, only to be deposed and then murdered."

  - sp: WORCESTER
    o:
      - "And for whose death we in the world’s wide mouth"
      - "Live scandalized and foully spoken of."
    m:
      - "And for our part in his death, the whole world is scandalized by us, and speaks ill of us."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "But soft, I pray you. Did King Richard then"
      - "Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer"
      - "Heir to the crown?"
    m:
      - "Stop a moment, please. Did King Richard really proclaim that my brother-in-law Edmund Mortimer was next in line for the throne?"

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "  He did; myself did hear it."
    m:
      - "He did. I heard it myself."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "Nay then, I cannot blame his cousin King"
      - "That wished him on the barren mountains starve."
      - "But shall it be that you that set the crown"
      - "Upon the head of this forgetful man"
      - "And for his sake wear the detested blot"
      - "Of murderous subornation—shall it be"
      - "That you a world of curses undergo,"
      - "Being the agents or base second means,"
      - "The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?"
      - "O, pardon me that I descend so low"
      - "To show the line and the predicament"
      - "Wherein you range under this subtle King."
      - "Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,"
      - "Or fill up chronicles in time to come,"
      - "That men of your nobility and power"
      - "Did gage them both in an unjust behalf"
      - "(As both of you, God pardon it, have done)"
      - "To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,"
      - "An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?"
      - "And shall it in more shame be further spoken"
      - "That you are fooled, discarded, and shook off"
      - "By him for whom these shames you underwent?"
      - "No, yet time serves wherein you may redeem"
      - "Your banished honors and restore yourselves"
      - "Into the good thoughts of the world again,"
      - "Revenge the jeering and disdain’d contempt"
      - "Of this proud King, who studies day and night"
      - "To answer all the debt he owes to you"
      - "Even with the bloody payment of your deaths."
      - "Therefore I say—"
    m:
      - "Then I can’t blame King Henry for wishing for him to starve in the wilderness. But is it right that you—who put the crown on Henry’s forgetful head, and who carry the accusations of murder for Henry’s sake—should be the target of the world’s curses? When you were only accomplices and instruments? Is it right to blame the ropes, the ladder, or the hangman for a man’s death? Forgive me for mentioning that you two are like those sordid objects, having been exploited by this conniving King. But will you stand by while people today speak of your shame? While history books record that men of your nobility and power dedicated themselves to as unjust a cause (which, God forgive you, you both did) as the overthrowing of Richard, that sweet lovely rose, and the planting of this thorn, this weed, Bolingbroke in Richard’s place? Will you listen as people say that you are fools, and that you’ve been tossed away by the very person you shamed yourselves to help? No. There is still time for you to redeem your reputations and restore your good names in the eyes of the world. Take revenge against this King who mocks and scorns you. He thinks constantly about how to repay you for all you did—by putting you to death. So I say—"

  - sp: WORCESTER
    o:
      - "  Peace, cousin, say no more."
      - "And now I will unclasp a secret book,"
      - "And to your quick-conceiving discontents"
      - "I’ll read you matter deep and dangerous,"
      - "As full of peril and adventurous spirit"
      - "As to o’erwalk a current roaring loud"
      - "On the unsteadfast footing of a spear."
    m:
      - "Quiet, nephew; don’t say any more. I have a secret for you, which is hidden like a book with a lock. I will open the book and read you a dark, dangerous story that will appeal to your righteous anger. It’s full of peril and adventure, as risky as walking across a churning, thundering river while balanced unsteadily on a spear."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "If he fall in, good night, or sink or swim!"
      - "Send danger from the east unto the west,"
      - "So honor cross it from the north to south,"
      - "And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs"
      - "To rouse a lion than to start a hare!"
    m:
      - "If he falls in, then it’s all over, whether he sinks or swims. The honor of the struggle is all that counts, no matter what the danger is or where it comes from. It takes more courage to wake a sleeping lion than to frighten a rabbit!"

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "Imagination of some great exploit"
      - "Drives him beyond the bounds of patience."
    m:
      - "Dreaming about this heroic exploit is driving him past his patience."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap"
      - "To pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon,"
      - "Or dive into the bottom of the deep,"
      - "Where fathom line could never touch the ground,"
      - "And pluck up drownèd honor by the locks,"
      - "So he that doth redeem her thence might wear"
      - "Without corrival all her dignities."
      - "But out upon this half-faced fellowship!"
    m:
      - "By God, I think it would be easy to jump up and grab honor off of the moon’s pale face, or to dive into the deepest ocean and pull up honor by its hair. Then the man who rescues honor can wear her glory alone, without rivals. To hell with sharing the glory!"

  - sp: WORCESTER
    o:
      - "*(to NORTHUMBERLAND)* He apprehends a world of figures here,"
      - "But not the form of what he should attend.—"
      - "*(to HOTSPUR)* Good cousin, give me audience for a while."
    m:
      - "*(to NORTHUMBERLAND)* He sees a world built by his imagination, but that world is not the one he should be paying attention to. *(to HOTSPUR)* Nephew, listen to me a minute."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "  I’ll keep them all."
      - "By God, he shall not have a Scot of them."
      - "No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not."
      - "I’ll keep them, by this hand!"
    m:
      - "I’ll keep them all. By God, the King won’t get a single Scot, even if having a Scot would save his soul! I’ll keep them, I swear."

  - sp: WORCESTER
    o:
      - "  You start away"
      - "And lend no ear unto my purposes:"

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "  Nay, I will. That’s flat!"
      - "He said he would not ransom Mortimer,"
      - "Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer."
      - "But I will find him when he lies asleep,"
      - "And in his ear I’ll hollo “Mortimer.”"
      - "Nay,"
      - "I’ll have a starling shall be taught to speak"
      - "Nothing but “Mortimer,” and give it him"
      - "To keep his anger still in motion."
    m:
      - "Yes, I will; there’s no doubt about it. The King said he would not pay ransom for Mortimer. He forbid me from speaking of Mortimer. But I’ll find him when he’s sleeping, and I’ll shout “Mortimer!” into his ears. No; I’ll get a bird and teach it to say nothing but “Mortimer,” and I’ll give it to the King to anger him forever."

  - sp: WORCESTER
    o:
      - "Hear you, cousin, a word."
    m:

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "All studies here I solemnly defy,"
      - "Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke."
      - "And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales—"
      - "But that I think his father loves him not"
      - "And would be glad he met with some mischance—"
      - "I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale."
    m:
      - "From now on, all other pursuits I’ll cast aside, except for scheming how to aggravate this Bolingbroke and his son, the lowlife Prince of Wales. If it weren’t for the fact that I suspect Henry doesn’t love his son, and that he’d be glad to see misfortune befall him, I’d poison the Prince’s ale."

  - sp: WORCESTER
    o:

    o:
      - "*(to HOTSPUR)* Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool"
      - "Art thou to break into this woman’s mood,"
      - "Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!"
    m:
      - "*(to HOTSPUR)* You are an impatient and short-tempered fool to start nattering on like a woman, not listening to any voice but your own!"

    o:
      - "Why, look you, I am whipped and scourged with rods,"
      - "Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear"
      - "Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke."
      - "In Richard’s time—what do you call the place?"
      - "A plague upon it! It is in Gloucestershire."
      - "’Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,"
      - "His uncle York; where I first bowed my knee"
      - "Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke."

    m:
      - "Listen, I feel like I’m being whipped with sticks and stung by ants when I hear about this vile politician, Bolingbroke. When Richard was alive—what is that place called? Damn, it’s in Gloucestershire; it’s where that crazy duke’s uncle lived, his uncle York. It’s where I first met this lying Bolingbroke, and bowed to him.—Shoot!—It happened when you and Bolingbroke came back from Ravenspurgh."

      - "O, the devil take such cozeners!—God forgive me!"
      - "Good uncle, tell your tale. I have done."
    m:
      - "Right. What great courtesy that flattering dog paid me! “The promise of his childhood has come true,” he said. “Gentle Harry Percy,” he called me, and “kind kinsman.” To hell with liars like him! — I’m sorry. Uncle, go on. I’m done."

      - "Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,"
      - "The Archbishop."
    m:
      - "Then go back to your Scottish prisoners. Release them at once, without ransom. Make friends with Douglas, and use his influence to gather an army in Scotland. He’ll gladly help you for many reasons, which I’ll write you about soon. *(to NORTHUMBERLAND)* Now you, sir. While your son is busy in Scotland, you will strike up a close alliance with the Archbishop, that noble, well-beloved churchman."

    m:
      - "Yes, and he’s sorely upset about his brother, Lord Scroop, whom Bolingbroke put to death in Bristol. I’m not merely speculating; I’m telling you what I know for a fact has been considered, plotted, and set into motion. They’re only waiting now for the right moment to strike."

      - "To make us strangers to his looks of love."
    m:
      - "And we’ve got good reasons to hurry and save ourselves by raising an army. No matter how hard we try to look like everything’s fine, the King will always think he owes us for having helped him take the throne, and he’ll worry that we don’t feel we’ve been properly compensated. Until he finds a way to pay us for good—by killing us. You can see that he’s already begun to distance himself from us."

    m:
      - "Nephew, farewell. Don’t do any more than I tell you to do in the letters I’ll write you. When the time comes, which will be soon, I’ll sneak off to Glendower and Mortimer. I’ll plan it so that you, Douglas and all our armies will arrive together. Then we can face our future with strength instead of the uncertainty we feel now."
