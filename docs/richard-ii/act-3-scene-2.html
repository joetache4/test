Instead, let your venomous spiders and your toads get in their way. Put stinging nettles in their path. And when they pick a flower from the ground, let a poisonous snake bite and kill them.

<b>KING RICHARD II</b>
<p>You are so discouraging, cousin! Don’t you know that at nighttime, when the sun has set, thieves roam the earth unseen, boldly committing murder and other crimes? But when the sun comes up and lights the treetops and every dark hole, then those same criminals stand trembling with no way to hide. So when this thief, this traitor Bolingbroke, who has been committing all these crimes during the nighttime, sees us coming up with the sun, he’ll be ashamed and will tremble at the light of day. All the water in an ocean can’t wash away a king’s right to the throne. Mere mortals can’t get rid of someone who has been appointed by God. For every solider Bolingbroke has enlisted to fight against me, God has given me an angel. And when angels fight, the weak men fall, since heaven always guards those who are right.</p>

<b>KING RICHARD II</b>
<p>It doesn’t matter where he is. Let’s not try to cheer ourselves up. We must talk about graves and worms and epitaphs. We’ll make the dust our paper and use our tears to write a message of sorrow on the earth. Let’s choose our executors and talk of wills. And, yet, what can we bequeath to anyone other than leaving our rotting bodies to the ground? Our lands and our lives now belong to Bolingbroke, and we can call nothing our own except for our deaths and that little patch of earth that will cover our buried bodies. For God’s sake, let’s sit on the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings, how some were overthrown and others killed in war. Some were haunted by the ghosts of the kings they had overthrown. Still others were poisoned by their wives, while others were killed in their sleep. All of them, however, were murdered. There is always death around kings, and there’s no way to escape it. Death laughs at the king’s reign and mocks his great ceremonies, allowing him to live a little while and play the monarch. Death fills him with pride as if the king’s body were immortal, and at the end death comes and with little effort kills the body. Then goodbye, king! So stop treating me so respectfully. There’s no need to pretend that I am any different than you. You’ve been wrong about me all this time. I feel all the same things that you do. I have desires and feel sad and need friends, just like you. How, then, can you say that I’m a king?</p>

<p>That bids me be of comfort any more.</p>
<p>Go to Flint castle: there I’ll pine away;</p>
<p>A king, woe’s slave, shall kingly woe obey.</p>
<p>That power I have, discharge; and let them go</p>
<p>To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,</p>
<p>For I have none: let no man speak again</p>
<p>To alter this, for counsel is but vain.</p>

<p>I curse you, cousin, for convincing me not to be sad anymore. What do you have to say now? What comforts us now? I swear to God, I will forever hate the man who tells me not to despair now. Go to Flint Castle. That’s where I will wait. I am a king, but I am a slave of sorrow, and I will follow sorrow’s orders. Tell my army that they may leave and go work for some cause that has hope, since I have none. I don’t want to hear anyone trying to change my mind. Any advice is pointless.</p>
