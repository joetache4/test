<b>MACBETH</b>
<p>Time, thou anticipat’st my dread exploits.</p>
<p>The flighty purpose never is o’ertook</p>
<p>Unless the deed go with it. From this moment</p>
<p>The very firstlings of my heart shall be</p>
<p>The firstlings of my hand. And even now,</p>
<p>To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:</p>
<p>The castle of Macduff I will surprise,</p>
<p>Seize upon Fife, give to th’ edge o’ th’ sword</p>
<p>His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls</p>
<p>That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool.</p>
<p>This deed I’ll do before this purpose cool.</p>
<p>But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?</p>
<p>Come, bring me where they are.</p>

<b>MACBETH</b>
<p>Time, you thwart my dreadful plans. Unless a person does something the second he thinks of it, he’ll never get a chance to do it. From now on, as soon as I decide to do something I’m going to act immediately. In fact, I’ll start following up my thoughts with actions right now. I’ll raid Macduff’s castle, seize the town of Fife, and kill his wife, his children, and anyone else unfortunate enough to stand in line for his inheritance. No more foolish talk. I will do this deed before I lose my sense of purpose. But no more spooky visions!—Where are the messengers? Come, bring me to them.</p>
