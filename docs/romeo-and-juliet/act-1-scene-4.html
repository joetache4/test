<p>It’s out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that.

Nor are we going to recite a memorized speech to introduce ourselves. Let them judge us however they please. We’ll give them a dance and then hit the road.</p>

<p>She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes</p>
<p>In shape no bigger than an agate stone</p>
<p>On the forefinger of an alderman,</p>
<p>Drawn with a team of little atomi</p>
<p>Over men’s noses as they lie asleep.</p>
<p>Her wagon spokes made of long spinners’ legs,</p>
<p>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,</p>
<p>Her traces of the smallest spider’s web,</p>
<p>Her collars of the moonshine’s watery beams,</p>
<p>Her whip of cricket’s bone, the lash of film,</p>
<p>Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,</p>
<p>Not half so big as a round little worm</p>
<p>Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.</p>
<p>Her chariot is an empty hazelnut</p>
<p>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,</p>
<p>Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.</p>
<p>And in this state she gallops night by night</p>
<p>Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;</p>
<p>On courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;</p>
<p>O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;</p>
<p>O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,</p>
<p>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,</p>
<p>Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.</p>
<p>Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,</p>
<p>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.</p>
<p>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail</p>
<p>Tickling a parson’s nose as he lies asleep,</p>
<p>Then he dreams of another benefice.</p>
<p>Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,</p>
<p>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</p>
<p>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,</p>
<p>Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon</p>
<p>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</p>
<p>And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two</p>
<p>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</p>
<p>That plaits the manes of horses in the night</p>
<p>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,</p>
<p>Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes.</p>
<p>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</p>
<p>That presses them and learns them first to bear,</p>
<p>Making them women of good carriage.</p>
<p>This is she—</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>MERCUTIO</b>
<p>She’s the fairies’ midwife. She’s no bigger than the stone on a city councilman’s ring. She rides around in a wagon drawn by tiny little atoms, and she rides over men’s noses as they lie sleeping. The spokes of her wagon are made of spiders’ legs. The cover of her wagon is made of grasshoppers’ wings. The harnesses are made of the smallest spiderwebs. The collars are made out of moonbeams. Her whip is a thread attached to a cricket’s bone. Her wagon driver is a tiny bug in a gray coat; he’s not half the size of a little round worm that comes from the finger of a lazy young girl. Her chariot is a hazelnut shell. It was made by a carpenter squirrel or an old grubworm; they’ve made wagons for the fairies as long as anyone can remember. In this royal wagon, she rides every night through the brains of lovers and makes them dream about love. She rides over courtiers’ knees, and they dream about curtsying. She rides over lawyers’ fingers, and right away, they dream about their fees. She rides over ladies’ lips, and they immediately dream of kisses. Queen Mab often puts blisters on their lips because their breath smells like candy, which makes her mad. Sometimes she rides over a courtier’s lips, and he dreams of making money off of someone. Sometimes she tickles a priest’s nose with a tithe-pigs tail, and he dreams of a large donation. Sometimes she rides over a soldier’s neck, and he dreams of cutting the throats of foreign enemies, of breaking down walls, of ambushes, of Spanish swords, and of enormous cups of liquor. And then, drums beat in his ear and he wakes up. He’s frightened, so he says a couple of prayers and goes back to sleep. She is the same Mab who tangles the hair in horses’ manes at night and makes the tangles hard in the dirty hairs, which bring bad luck if they’re untangled. Mab is the old hag who gives false sex dreams to virgins and teaches them how to hold a lover and bear a child. She’s the one—</p>
