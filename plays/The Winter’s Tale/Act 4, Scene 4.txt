    o:
      - "These your unusual weeds to each part of you"
      - "Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora"
      - "Peering in April’s front. This your sheep-shearing"
      - "Is as a meeting of the petty gods,"
      - "And you the queen on’t."
    m:
      - "Your festival clothes give you a new look. No longer a shepherdess, but the goddess of flowers appearing at the beginning of April. Your sheep-shearing is like a meeting of minor gods, and you are the queen of them."

  - sp: PERDITA
    o:
      - "Sir, my gracious lord,"
      - "To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:"
      - "O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,"
      - "The gracious mark o’ the land, you have obscured"
      - "With a swain’s wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,"
      - "Most goddess-like prank’d up: but that our feasts"
      - "In every mess have folly and the feeders"
      - "Digest it with a custom, I should blush"
      - "To see you so attired, swoon, I think,"
      - "To show myself a glass."
    m:
      - "My gracious lord, it doesn’t suit me to rebuke you for exaggerations. Oh, pardon me for naming them! You, the one whose charms make him admired by the public, have hidden yourself in rustic clothing, while I, just a poor lowly girl, am made up like a goddess. If there weren’t foolishness at every table during our feasts, and if people weren’t accustomed to such foolishness by now, I’d feel embarrassed to see you dressed like that and would faint to see myself in the mirror."

  - sp: FLORIZEL
    o:
      - "I bless the time"
      - "When my good falcon made her flight across"
      - "Thy father’s ground."
    m:
      - "I bless the day when my hunting bird flew across your father’s land."

  - sp: PERDITA
    o:
      - "Now Jove afford you cause!"
      - "To me the difference forges dread; your greatness"
      - "Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble"
      - "To think your father, by some accident,"
      - "Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!"
      - "How would he look, to see his work so noble"
      - "Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how"
      - "Should I, in these my borrow’d flaunts, behold"
      - "The sternness of his presence?"
    m:
      - "Now may Jove give you reason to be glad! For me the difference in rank between us fills me with dread, though you in your greatness aren’t used to fear. Even now I tremble to think that your father might by some accident pass this way, like you did. Oh, the Fates! How would he look when he discovered that his noble son was so humbly dressed! What would he say? How should I, in this borrowed finery, look upon his stern presence?"

  - sp: FLORIZEL
    o:
      - "Apprehend"
      - "Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,"
      - "Humbling their deities to love, have taken"
      - "The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter"
      - "Became a bull, and bellow’d; the green Neptune"
      - "A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,"
      - "Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,"
      - "As I seem now. Their transformations"
      - "Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,"
      - "Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires"
      - "Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts"
      - "Burn hotter than my faith."
    m:
      - "Imagine only happiness. The gods themselves have taken on the form of beasts when they’re in love. Jupiter became a bull and bellowed; Neptune became a ram and bleated. And the god of the sun, golden Apollo, became a humble shepherd just as I appear today. But their transformations were never for someone so beautiful, and neither were their loves as chaste as mine, because my desires are secondary to my honor, and my faith burns hotter than my lusts."

  - sp: PERDITA
    o:
      - "O, but, sir,"
      - "Your resolution cannot hold, when ’tis"
      - "Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:"
      - "One of these two must be necessities,"
      - "Which then will speak, that you must"
      - "change this purpose,"
      - "Or I my life."
    m:
      - "But sir, your feelings toward me might falter when they are opposed, as they must be, by the power of the king. Then one of the two must happen: either you will change your feelings or I will lose my life."

  - sp: FLORIZEL
    o:
      - "Thou dearest Perdita,"
      - "With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not"
      - "The mirth o’ the feast. Or I’ll be thine, my fair,"
      - "Or not my father’s. For I cannot be"
      - "Mine own, nor any thing to any, if"
      - "I be not thine. To this I am most constant,"
      - "Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;"
      - "Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing"
      - "That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:"
      - "Lift up your countenance, as it were the day"
      - "Of celebration of that nuptial which"
      - "We two have sworn shall come."
    m:
      - "Dearest Perdita, don’t let these farfetched thoughts dampen the high-spirits of the feast. I’ll be yours, my fair love, and not my father’s. I can’t be myself, or anything to anyone, if I’m not yours. My feelings won’t change, even if destiny says we are not to be together. Be happy, dearest. Get rid of these thoughts by busying yourself with something else. Your guests are coming. Look happy, as if it were the day we’re getting married, as we’ve sworn we will."

  - sp: PERDITA
    o:
      - "O lady Fortune,"
      - "Stand you auspicious!"
    m:

      - "See, your guests approach:"
      - "Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,"
      - "And let’s be red with mirth."
    m:
      - "See, your guests are approaching. Prepare yourself to entertain them in a lively manner, and let’s be red-faced from all our laughter."

    ms: "The SHEPHERD, YOKEL, MOPSA, DORCAS, and others enter. POLIXENES and CAMILLO, who are in disguise, also enter."

    o:
      - "Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon"
      - "This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,"
      - "Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;"
      - "Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,"
      - "At upper end o’ the table, now i’ the middle;"
      - "On his shoulder, and his; her face o’ fire"
      - "With labour and the thing she took to quench it,"
      - "She would to each one sip. You are retired,"
      - "As if you were a feasted one and not"
      - "The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid"
      - "These unknown friends to’s welcome; for it is"
      - "A way to make us better friends, more known."
      - "Come, quench your blushes and present yourself"
      - "That which you are, mistress o’ the feast: come on,"
      - "And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,"
      - "As your good flock shall prosper."
    m:
      - "Oh, daughter, when my old wife was still alive, on this day she was a pantry maid, butler, cook, mistress of the house, and servant. She welcomed all, served all, would sing her song and dance her share. She would sit first at the head of the table, then in the middle. She’d be on this man’s shoulder, and then on that one’s. Her face would be red from work and what she drank to quench her thirst, and she would drink a toast to each person. You are withdrawn, as if you were a guest and not the hostess of this party. Please, welcome these strangers so that we can become better acquainted. Come, stop blushing and present yourself as that which you are: the mistress of the feast. Come on and welcome us to your sheep-shearing, so that your flock will prosper."

  - sp: PERDITA
    o:
      - "*(to POLIXENES)* Sir, welcome:"

    ms: "To Camillo"

  - o:
      - "You’re welcome, sir."
      - "Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,"
      - "For you there’s rosemary and rue; these keep"
      - "Seeming and savour all the winter long:"
      - "Grace and remembrance be to you both,"
      - "And welcome to our shearing!"
    m:
      - "You are welcome here, sir. Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Honored sirs, for you there are rosemary and rue, which keep their appearance and scent all through the winter. May you both have grace and remembrance, and welcome to our shearing!"

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "Shepherdess,"
      - "A fair one are you—well you fit our ages"
      - "With flowers of winter."
    m:
      - "Fair shepherdess, since we are old, you do well to pair us with winter flowers."

  - sp: PERDITA
    o:
      - "Sir, the year growing ancient,"
      - "Not yet on summer’s death, nor on the birth"
      - "Of trembling winter, the fairest"
      - "flowers o’ the season"
      - "Are our carnations and streak’d gillyvors,"
      - "Which some call nature’s bastards: of that kind"
      - "Our rustic garden’s barren; and I care not"
      - "To get slips of them."
    m:
      - "Sir, the year is growing old, with the summer not yet over and the winter not yet starting. The fairest flowers of this season are carnations and two-toned gillyflowers, which some call nature’s bastards. But we don’t have any of those flowers in our garden, and I don’t care to get any cuttings of them."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "Wherefore, gentle maiden,"
      - "Do you neglect them?"
    m:
      - "Kind maiden, why do you reject them?"

  - sp: PERDITA
    o:
      - "For I have heard it said"
      - "There is an art which in their piedness shares"
      - "With great creating nature."
    m:
      - "Because I’ve heard that their many colors are due as much to cross-breeding as to nature."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "Say there be;"
      - "Yet nature is made better by no mean"
      - "But nature makes that mean: so, over that art"
      - "Which you say adds to nature, is an art"
      - "That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry"
      - "A gentler scion to the wildest stock,"
      - "And make conceive a bark of baser kind"
      - "By bud of nobler race: this is an art"
      - "Which does mend nature, change it rather, but"
      - "The art itself is nature."
    m:
      - "Perhaps that’s true. But any technique used to improve nature is itself made by nature, so any form of artifice that adds to nature is really a natural artifice. You see, sweet maid, we marry a more noble stem to a wild stem, so that a lesser plant produces one that is superior. This is an art that improves nature, or rather changes it, but the art itself is natural."

  - sp: PERDITA
    o:
      - "So it is."
    m:
      - "So it is."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,"
      - "And do not call them bastards."
    m:
      - "Then fill your garden with gillyflowers, and don’t call them bastards."

  - sp: PERDITA
    o:
      - "I’ll not put"
      - "The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;"
      - "No more than were I painted I would wish"
      - "This youth should say ’twere well and only therefore"
      - "Desire to breed by me. Here’s flowers for you;"
      - "Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;"
      - "The marigold, that goes to bed wi’ the sun"
      - "And with him rises weeping: these are flowers"
      - "Of middle summer, and I think they are given"
      - "To men of middle age. You’re very welcome."
    m:
      - "I won’t put a shovel in the dirt to plant a single one of them, just as I wouldn’t want this youth here to think I’m attractive and want to sleep with me only because I’m wearing makeup. Here are flowers for you: lavender, mint, savory, marjoram, and the marigold, which sets with the sun and rises with it filled with dew. These are flowers that bloom in the middle of summer, and I think they should be given to men of middle age. You’re very welcome here. *(She gives them flowers.)*"

    o:
      - "I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,"
      - "And only live by gazing."
    m:

  - sp: PERDITA
    o:
      - "Out, alas!"
      - "You’d be so lean, that blasts of January"
      - "Would blow you through and through."
      - "Now, my fair’st friend,"
      - "I would I had some flowers o’ the spring that might"
      - "Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,"
      - "That wear upon your virgin branches yet"
      - "Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,"
      - "For the flowers now, that frighted thou let’st fall"
      - "From Dis’ waggon! daffodils,"
      - "That come before the swallow dares, and take"
      - "The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,"
      - "But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes"
      - "Or Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses"
      - "That die unmarried, ere they can behold"
      - "Bight Phoebus in his strength—a malady"
      - "Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and"
      - "The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,"
      - "The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,"
      - "To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,"
      - "To strew him o’er and o’er!"
    m:
      - "Oh, not at all! You’d be so skinny that the icy winds of January would blow right through you. *(to Florizel)* Now, my fairest friend, I wish I had flowers of the spring that would match your age, *(to Mopsa and Dorcas)* and yours, and yours, who are still in your adolescence. Oh, Proserpina, if only we had the flowers that you, frightened, let fall from Dis’ chariot! Daffodils that bloom before the swallows dare return from the south, and that charm the winds of March with their beauty. Modest violets that are sweeter than Juno’s eyes or Cytherea’s breath. Pale primroses that die unmarried, before they can see the bright sun at full strength—a sickness that often affects young women. Bold oxlips and the crown imperial lily, lilies of all kinds, the flower-de-luce being one! Oh, if only I had these flowers to make garlands and to throw over my sweet friend!"

    o:
      - "What, like a corse?"
    m:
      - "What, like a corpse?"

  - sp: PERDITA
    o:
      - "No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;"
      - "Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,"
      - "But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:"
      - "Methinks I play as I have seen them do"
      - "In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine"
      - "Does change my disposition."
    m:
      - "No, like a riverbank for love to lie and play on. Not like a corpse—or, if so, not one to be buried, but one alive and in my arms. Come, take your flowers. I think I am playing as I’ve seen them do during Whitsun festivities. This outfit I’m wearing certainly changes my attitude."

  - sp: FLORIZEL
    o:
      - "What you do"
      - "Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet."
      - "I’ld have you do it ever: when you sing,"
      - "I’ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,"
      - "Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,"
      - "To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you"
      - "A wave o’ the sea, that you might ever do"
      - "Nothing but that; move still, still so,"
      - "And own no other function: each your doing,"
      - "So singular in each particular,"
      - "Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,"
      - "That all your acts are queens."
    m:
      - "What you do is always better than what is normally done. When you speak, sweet, I’d have you do it forever. When you sing, I’d have you buy and sell with songs, and give alms, pray, and arrange your affairs with singing. When you dance, I wish you were a wave in the sea, so that you would only ever do that and have no other purpose in life. Everything you do is so perfect that whatever you do is the best."

    o:
      - "O Doricles,"

      - "And the true blood which peepeth fairly through’t,"
      - "Do plainly give you out an unstain’d shepherd,"
      - "With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,"
      - "You woo’d me the false way."
    m:
      - "Oh, Doricles, you praise me too much. If your youth and your noble character didn’t shine through your disguise and reveal your purity, I might worry that you were trying to lead me astray."

  - sp: FLORIZEL
    o:
      - "I think you have"
      - "As little skill to fear as I have purpose"
      - "To put you to’t. But come; our dance, I pray:"
      - "Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,"
      - "That never mean to part."
    m:
      - "I think you have as little cause to fear as I have intention to make you feel afraid. But come, dance with me please. Give me your hand, my Perdita, just as turtledoves pair for life and never part from one another."

      - "But smacks of something greater than herself,"
      - "Too noble for this place."
    m:
      - "She is the prettiest common girl that’s ever run across the lawn. Everything she does has an air of something greater than herself, something too noble for this place."

      - "That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is"

      - "I think so too; for never gazed the moon"
      - "Upon the water as he’ll stand and read"
      - "As ’twere my daughter’s eyes: and, to be plain,"
      - "I think there is not half a kiss to choose"
      - "Who loves another best."
    m:
      - "They call him Doricles and say he has a valuable pasture. He’s told me so himself, and I believe him. He looks honest. He says he loves my daughter, and I think he does. He gazes into my daughter’s eyes as intently as the moon shines onto water. And, to be blunt, I don’t think there’s a way to tell from their kiss who loves the other more."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:

      - "Which he not dreams of."
    m:

    o:
      - "O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the"
      - "door, you would never dance again after a tabour and"
      - "pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings"
      - "several tunes faster than you’ll tell money; he"
      - "utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men’s"
      - "ears grew to his tunes."
    m:
      - "Oh, master, if you had heard the peddler at the door, you’d never again dance to a tambourine and a pipe, and a bagpipe wouldn’t tempt you. He sings several songs faster than you can count money. He sings them as readily as if he had digested them completely, and all men can’t help but listen."

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "He could never come better; he shall come in. I"
      - "love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful"
      - "matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing"
      - "indeed and sung lamentably."
    m:
      - "He couldn’t have come at a better time. Let him in. I love a ballad almost too much, especially a sad subject set to a happy tune, or a pleasant subject sung mournfully."

    o:

      - "her;” and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,"
      - "as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into"
      - "the matter, he makes the maid to answer “Whoop, do me"
      - "no harm, good man;” puts him off, slights him, with"
      - "“Whoop, do me no harm, good man.”"
    m:
      - "He has songs for all men and women. He fits them to his customers closer than gloves. He has pretty love songs for the maid, without any lewdness, which is unusual, and with delicate refrains full of dildos and orgasms, like “jump her and thump her.” And if an obscene rascal would try to make mischief and interrupt the song, the peddler makes the maid answer, “Hey, do me no harm, good man,” and puts him off that way."

They crowded around me to see who could buy first, as if my trinkets were blessed and brought grace to the buyer. It let me know who had the fullest purse, and what I saw I remembered to put to use later. The yokel, who lacks just one quality to be a reasonable man, loved the girls’ song so much that he wouldn’t leave until he had bought both the tune and the words. And all the others were so entranced that it was as though all their other senses were committed to hearing. You could have stolen a skirt because no one could feel anything. It was easy to strip a purse from a codpiece, and I could have used a file to take keys off a chain. There was no hearing or feeling anything except for that song, and admiration for it. So while they were spellbound I stole most of their purses, which were filled with money for the festival. If the old man hadn’t come in wailing about his daughter and the king’s son and scared my little birds from the feed, I would have taken purses from every one."

It’s a great pity, but it’s necessary. That an old shepherd and rogue would act as a broker and offer to have his daughter marry into the royal family! Some say he’ll be stoned, but that manner of death is too soft for someone who tried to drag the throne into a sheep’s pen! He can’t die too many times, or in too painful a way."

Then, raw as his flesh is, on the hottest day that can be predicted he’ll be set against a brick wall with the sun beating down upon him, and where he will be swarmed with flies. But why are we talking about these traitors, whose offences are so terrible that their misery should cause us happiness? Tell me, since you seem to be honest, ordinary men, what business do you have with the king? Since I’m well-respected at court, I’ll take you to his ship, bring you into his presence, and whisper to him a recommendation on your behalf. If there is any man beside the king who can help your case, that’s me."

If he thinks their complaint to the king has nothing to do with him and wants to put them back on shore again, let him call me a rogue for being so interfering.
