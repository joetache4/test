    ms: "CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS enter."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "My desolation does begin to make"
      - "A better life. ’Tis paltry to be Caesar."
      - "Not being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave,"
      - "A minister of her will. And it is great"
      - "To do that thing that ends all other deeds,"
      - "Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,"
      - "Which sleeps and never palates more the dung,"
      - "The beggar’s nurse, and Caesar’s."
    m:
      - "Being alone has helped me better understand my life. It’s pathetic to be Caesar. He can’t be Fortune; he’s only Fortune’s errand boy. It would be a great deed to commit suicide—that act which ends all other things, which makes all accidents and changes stop. Which causes you to sleep, and takes you away from earthly concerns."

  - os: "Enter PROCULEIUS"
    ms: "PROCULEIUS enters."

  - sp: PROCULEIUS
    o:
      - "Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt,"
      - "And bids thee study on what fair demands"
      - "Thou mean’st to have him grant thee."
    m:
      - "Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    What’s thy name?"
    m:
      - "What’s your name?"

  - sp: PROCULEIUS
    o:

    m:

      - "Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but"
      - "I do not greatly care to be deceived,"
      - "That have no use for trusting. If your master"
      - "Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,"
      - "That majesty, to keep decorum, must"
      - "No less beg than a kingdom. If he please"
      - "To give me conquered Egypt for my son,"
      - "He gives me so much of mine own as I"
      - "Will kneel to him with thanks."
    m:
      - "Antony told me about you. He said you were a man I could trust. But I don’t worry about being deceived because I don’t need to trust. If your master wants a queen to beg from him, you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom. If he will grant me conquered Egypt, so that I may give it to my son, I will kneel to him with thanks."

  - sp: PROCULEIUS
    o:
      - "    Be of good cheer."
      - "You’re fall’n into a princely hand. Fear nothing."
      - "Make your full reference freely to my lord,"
      - "Who is so full of grace that it flows over"
      - "On all that need. Let me report to him"
      - "Your sweet dependency, and you shall find"
      - "A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness"
      - "Where he for grace is kneeled to."
    m:
      - "Be content. You’re in the charge of an honorable man. Don’t be afraid. You can ask for anything from my lord. His generosity flows to anyone in need. If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly, he’ll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    Pray you, tell him"
      - "I am his fortune’s vassal, and I send him"
      - "The greatness he has got. I hourly learn"
      - "A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly"
      - "Look him i’ th’ face."
    m:
      - "Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune. I give up to him the glory he has won. I’m learning every hour how to be subservient. I’d be happy to meet with him in person."

  - sp: PROCULEIUS
    o:
      - "    This I’ll report, dear lady."
      - "Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied"

    m:

      - "Relieved but not betrayed."
    m:

      - "His nobleness well acted, which your death"
      - "Will never let come forth."
    m:
      - "Don’t insult my master’s generosity by killing yourself. The world will see how noble he is by the way he treats you. Your death would prevent that."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    Where art thou, Death?"
      - "Come hither, come! Come, come and take a queen"
      - "Worth many babes and beggars!"
    m:
      - "Where are you, Death? Come here. Come, and you can have a queen. One queen is worth more than a whole number of babies and beggars, your cheapest conquests."

  - sp: PROCULEIUS
    o:
      - "    Oh, temperance, lady!"
    m:
      - "Oh, control yourself, lady!"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA

      - "Nor once be chastised with the sober eye"
      - "Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up"
      - "And show me to the shouting varletry"
      - "Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt"
      - "Be gentle grave unto me. Rather on Nilus’ mud"
      - "Lay me stark naked and let the waterflies"
      - "Blow me into abhorring. Rather make"
      - "My country’s high pyramides my gibbet"
      - "And hang me up in chains!"
    m:
      - "Sir, I won’t eat. I won’t drink. And don’t expect me to talk. I won’t sleep either. I’ll destroy my body. Let Caesar do whatever he wants. You’d better understand that I won’t wait till I’m chained up in your master’s court, and I won’t let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia. Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome? I’d rather die in a ditch in Egypt, and make it my gentle grave. I’d rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me, making me disgusting. I’d rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids!"

  - sp: PROCULEIUS
    o:
      - "    You do extend"
      - "These thoughts of horror further than you shall"
      - "Find cause in Caesar."
    m:

      - "If you’ll employ me to him."
    m:
      - "So be it, Dolabella. Caesar’s thanks are my greatest reward. Be kind to her. *(to CLEOPATRA)* I’ll relay to Caesar any request you want to give me."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "I cannot tell."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "No matter, sir, what I have heard or known."
      - "You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams."
      - "Is ’t not your trick?"
    m:
      - "It doesn’t matter what I’ve heard or known. You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams. Isn’t that your habit?"

  - sp: DOLABELLA
    o:
      - "    I understand not, madam."
    m:
      - "I don’t know what you mean, madam."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:

      - "Oh, such another sleep, that I might see"
      - "But such another man!"
    m:
      - "I dreamed about an emperor called Antony. Oh, I wish I could sleep again, so I could have another dream like that!"

  - sp: DOLABELLA
    o:
      - "    If it might please ye—"
    m:
      - "If you’d like—"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "His face was as the heavens, and therein stuck"
      - "A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted"
      - "The little “O,” the earth."
    m:
      - "Authority radiated from his face, and his presence brought knowledge and order to the people of earth."

  - sp: DOLABELLA
    o:
      - "    Most sovereign creature—"
    m:
      - "Your majesty—"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "His legs bestrid the ocean. His reared arm"
      - "Crested the world. His voice was propertied"
      - "As all the tunèd spheres, and that to friends."
      - "But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,"
      - "He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,"
      - "There was no winter in ’t, an autumn ’twas"
      - "That grew the more by reaping. His delights"
      - "Were dolphinlike; they showed his back above"
      - "The element they lived in. In his livery"
      - "Walked crowns and crownets. Realms and islands were"
      - "As plates dropped from his pocket."
    m:
      - "His power extended from one shore to the other, as if he straddled the ocean with his legs. When he raised his arm in command, the world trembled. He spoke exquisitely to his friends, but when he wanted to terrify the world, his voice was like thunder. There was no end to his generosity. The more he gave, the more he wanted to give. His amusements showed another side of him, one detached from his world of responsibility and duty. Kings and noblemen served him. Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change."

  - sp: DOLABELLA
    o:
      - "    Cleopatra—"
    m:
      - "Cleopatra—"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Think you there was or might be such a man"
      - "As this I dreamt of?"
    m:
      - "Do you think there ever was, or could there ever be, a man such as the one I dreamed about?"

  - sp: DOLABELLA
    o:
      - "    Gentle madam, no."
    m:
      - "No, gentle madam."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "You lie up to the hearing of the gods."
      - "But if there be nor ever were one such,"
      - "It’s past the size of dreaming. Nature wants stuff"
      - "To vie strange forms with fancy, yet t’ imagine"
      - "An Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy,"
      - "Condemning shadows quite."
    m:
      - "The gods can hear you lying! But if there ever were such a man, simple dreams could never contain his greatness. When it comes to creating fantastical things, the natural world cannot compete with imagination. And yet, if the natural world could create something like Antony, it would have a masterpiece to rival anything fantasy might construct. Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings."

  - sp: DOLABELLA
    o:
      - "    Hear me, good madam."
      - "Your loss is as yourself, great, and you bear it"
      - "As answering to the weight. Would I might never"
      - "O’ertake pursued success, but I do feel,"
      - "By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites"
      - "My very heart at root."
    m:
      - "Listen to me, madam. You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable. You are responding appropriately to the greatness of that loss. I hope I never achieve success if I don’t feel some of your heartbroken grief right now."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    I thank you, sir. Know you what Caesar means to do with me?"
    m:
      - "Thank you, sir. Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me?"

  - sp: DOLABELLA
    o:
      - "I am loath to tell you what I would you knew."
    m:
      - "I’m reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Nay, pray you, sir."
    m:
      - "Please, sir—"

    m:
      - "Though he is honorable—"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "He’ll lead me, then, in triumph."
    m:
      - "He’ll still parade me through Rome as a trophy of war."

  - sp: DOLABELLA
    o:

    o:

      - "I pray you, rise. Rise, Egypt."
    m:
      - "Arise. You need not kneel to me. Please rise, Queen."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA

      - "Been laden with like frailties which before"
      - "Have often shamed our sex."
    m:
      - "You are now the sole lord of the entire world. I can’t explain my cause very clearly. I must admit to having the weaknesses that all women are accused of."

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "    Cleopatra, know"
      - "We will extenuate rather than enforce."
      - "If you apply yourself to our intents,"

      - "Of my good purposes and put your children"
      - "To that destruction which I’ll guard them from"
      - "If thereon you rely. I’ll take my leave."
    m:
      - "Cleopatra, understand that, rather than emphasize our power over you, we will soften if you accept our intentions, which are very compassionate toward you. Your acceptance will benefit you, but if you try to make me look cruel by committing suicide as Antony did, I won’t be so generous. Your children will be destroyed, a fate your submission will save them from. I’ll leave you now."

    m:

      - "    What, goest thou back? Thou shalt"
      - "Go back, I warrant thee! But I’ll catch thine eyes,"

    m:
      - "Look around you, Caesar. Oh, just see what happens after the pageantry is over! What is mine will be yours now. If we were to change places, what is yours would be mine. Seleucus’ ingratitude makes me wild. *(to SELEUCUS)* Oh, you slave! I can’t trust you any more than a prostitute. What are you doing? Cringing away? I’ll give you a good reason to cringe, I promise you. I’ll scratch out your eyes, even if they could fly. You slave! Soulless villain! Dog! Oh, that was unbelievably low!"

    m:
      - "Oh, Caesar, I am so ashamed. You condescended to visit me here, honoring my humble self with your lordly presence. And one of my own servants increases my disgrace by adding his envy!

      - "Bravest at the last,"
      - "She leveled at our purposes and, being royal,"
      - "Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?"
      - "I do not see them bleed."
    m:
      - "She was bravest at the end. She knew what I intended to do with her and, being royal, she took her own way out. How did they die? I don’t see any blood."

    o:
      - "    Who was last with them?"
    m:
      - "Who was with them last?"

  - sp: FIRST GUARD
    o:
      - "A simple countryman that brought her figs."
      - "This was his basket."
    m:
      - "A simple country farmer who brought her figs. This was the basket."

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "    Poisoned, then."
    m:
      - "They were poisoned, then."

  - sp: FIRST GUARD
    o:
      - "    Oh, Caesar,"
      - "This Charmian lived but now. She stood and spake."
      - "I found her trimming up the diadem"
      - "On her dead mistress. Tremblingly she stood"
      - "And on the sudden dropped."
    m:
      - "Oh, Caesar, this Charmian lived until a moment ago. She stood and spoke. I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress. She stood trembling, then suddenly dropped dead."

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "    Oh, noble weakness!"
      - "If they had swallowed poison, ’twould appear"
      - "By external swelling, but she looks like sleep,"
      - "As she would catch another Antony"
      - "In her strong toil of grace."
    m:
      - "Oh, noble weakness! If they had swallowed poison, it would be evident by external swelling. But she looks like she’s asleep, as if she would charm another Antony."

  - sp: DOLABELLA
    o:
      - "    Here on her breast"
      - "There is a vent of blood, and something blown."
      - "The like is on her arm."
    m:
      - "Here on her breast there’s a little bloody mark. There’s a similar mark on her arm."

  - sp: FIRST GUARD
    o:
      - "This is an aspic’s trail, and these fig leaves"
      - "Have slime upon them, such as th’ aspic leaves"
      - "Upon the caves of Nile."
    m:
      - "This is an asp’s trail, and these fig leaves have slime on them, just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile."

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "    Most probable"
      - "That so she died, for her physician tells me"
      - "She hath pursued conclusions infinite"
      - "Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed"
      - "And bear her women from the monument."
      - "She shall be buried by her Antony."
      - "No grave upon the earth shall clip in it"
      - "A pair so famous. High events as these"
      - "Strike those that make them, and their story is"
      - "No less in pity than his glory which"
      - "Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall"
      - "In solemn show attend this funeral,"
      - "And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see"
      - "High order in this great solemnity."
    m:
      - "That’s probably how she died. Her doctor told me she had searched for an infinite number of easy ways to die. Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb. She shall be buried next to her Antony. No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous. Momentous events like these strike those that cause them. Antony and Cleopatra’s story is as pitiable as my military exploits are glorious. Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome. Come, Dolabella. See that there is a dignified splendor to this great solemnity."

  - os: "Exeunt, bearing the dead bodies"
    ms: "They exit, with the GUARDS carrying CLEOPATRA’s bed and the two ladies."
