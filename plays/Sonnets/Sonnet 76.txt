      - "Why is my verse so barren of new pride,"
      - "So far from variation or quick change?"
      - "Why with the time do I not glance aside"
      - "To new-found methods and to compounds strange?"
      - "Why write I still all one, ever the same,"
      - "And keep invention in a noted weed,"
      - "That every word doth almost tell my name,"
      - "Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?"
      - "O know, sweet love, I always write of you,"
      - "And you and love are still my argument."
      - "So all my best is dressing old words new,"
      - "Spending again what is already spent:"
      - "  For as the sun is daily new and old,"
      - "  So is my love still telling what is told."
    m:
      - "Why is my poetry so lacking in new ornaments, so determined in avoiding variation and change? Why don’t I, like everyone else these days, take a look at the new literary styles and weird combinations of other writers? Why do I always write the same thing, always the same, and always in the same distinctive style, so that almost every word I write tells you who wrote it, where it was born, and where it comes from? Oh, you should know, sweet love, I always write about you, and you and love are continually my subjects. So the best I can do is find new words to say the same thing, spending again what I’ve already spent: Just as the sun is new and old every day, my love for you keeps making me tell what I’ve already told."
