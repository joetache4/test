<p>And so have I addressed me. Fortune now</p>
<p>To my heart’s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead.</p>
<p>“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”</p>
<p>You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.</p>
<p>What says the golden chest? Ha, let me see.</p>
<p>“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”</p>
<p>“What many men desire”—that “many” may be meant</p>
<p>By the fool multitude that choose by show,</p>
<p>Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;</p>
<p>Which pries not to th’ interior, but like the martlet</p>
<p>Builds in the weather on the outward wall,</p>
<p>Even in the force and road of casualty.</p>
<p>I will not choose what many men desire</p>
<p>Because I will not jump with common spirits</p>
<p>And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.</p>
<p>Why then, to thee, thou silver treasure house.</p>
<p>Tell me once more what title thou dost bear.</p>
<p>“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”</p>
<p>And well said too—for who shall go about</p>
<p>To cozen fortune and be honorable</p>
<p>Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume</p>
<p>To wear an undeservèd dignity.</p>
<p>Oh, that estates, degrees and offices</p>
<p>Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honor</p>
<p>Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!</p>
<p>How many then should cover that stand bare!</p>
<p>How many be commanded that command!</p>
<p>How much low peasantry would then be gleaned</p>
<p>From the true seed of honor! And how much honor</p>
<p>Picked from the chaff and ruin of the times</p>
<p>To be new varnished! Well, but to my choice.</p>
<p>“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”</p>
<p>I will assume desert.—Give me a key for this,</p>
<p>And instantly unlock my fortunes here.</p>

<b>ARRAGON</b>
<p>Okay, I’m ready. I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for! Gold, silver, and common lead. “He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” You’d have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you. What does the golden box say? Hmm, let me see: “He who chooses me will get what many men want.” What many men want—that “many” could mean that most people are fools and choose by whatever is flashy. They don’t go beyond what their eyes see. They don’t bother to find out what’s on the inside. Just like those birds called martins who build their nests on the outside of walls, people pay too much attention to what’s on the outside. So I won’t choose what many men desire, because I won’t jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population. So I guess it’s you, you silver treasure house. Tell me once more what you say. “He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” That’s nicely put—because who’s going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves? No one should have an honor he doesn’t deserve. Oh, wouldn’t it be great if property, rank, official positions, and other honors were earned only by merit, not by corruption? There wouldn’t be too many important men then. How many people who are humble now would be great then? How many people who give orders now would have to take orders? How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants? And how many common people would suddenly shine with nobility? Well, let me get back to my choice. “He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” I’ll assume I deserve the very best.—Give me a key for this one. I’ll unlock my fate here in a second.</p>
