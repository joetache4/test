<p>You’re hitting close to home there. I’d rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio. But I don’t think it’ll hurt him to tell the truth. This is what happened, General. Montano and I were talking when a man came running, crying for help. Cassio was chasing him with his sword out, trying to kill the guy. This gentleman stopped Cassio and told him to put away his sword. I followed the guy who was crying for help, to keep him from scaring the public. But he was fast and outran me. When I got back, I heard the swords clinking and Cassio swearing. I’d never heard him swear before. They were nearly killing each other, as you saw when you pulled them apart. I can’t tell you anything else. But nobody’s perfect, and even the best man sometimes loses control and strikes out in rage. Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano, who was only trying to help him, but I’m sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way, and Cassio couldn’t let it pass.</p>

<p>Who can say I’m evil when my advice is so good? That’s really the best way to win the Moor back again. It’s easy to get Desdemona on your side. She’s full of good intentions.

How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what’ll do him good? That’s the kind of argument you’d expect from Satan! When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces, just like I’m doing now. And while this fool is begging Desdemona to help him, and while she’s pleading his case to the Moor, I’ll poison the Moor’s ear against her, hinting that she’s taking Cassio’s side because of her lust for him. The more she tries to help Cassio, the more she’ll shake Othello’s confidence in her. And that’s how I’ll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all.</p>

<p>Does’t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.</p>
<p>And thou, by that small hurt, hath cashiered Cassio.</p>
<p>Though other things grow fair against the sun,</p>
<p>Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.</p>
<p>Content thyself awhile. In troth, ’tis morning.</p>
<p>Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.</p>
<p>Retire thee, go where thou art billeted.</p>
<p>Away, I say, thou shalt know more hereafter.</p>
<p>Nay, get thee gone.</p>

<p>You’re a poor man if you’re this impatient! If you get hurt, does your wound heal immediately? No, it heals gradually. We achieve things with our intelligence, not by magic, and intelligent planning takes time. Aren’t things going well? Cassio’s beaten you up, but with that tiny sacrifice on your part, you got Cassio discharged! If we’re patient, we’ll be rewarded with the fruits of our labors. My God, it’s morning. All this excitement has made the time fly by. Go back to where you’re staying and go to sleep. Go on, I’m telling you. You’ll understand better later. Go.</p>

<p>Two things are to be done:</p>
<p>My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.</p>
<p>I’ll set her on.</p>
<p>Myself, the while, to draw the Moor apart</p>
<p>And bring him jump when he may Cassio find</p>
<p>Soliciting his wife. Ay, that’s the way.</p>

<p>Now two things still need to be done. My wife has to help make Desdemona take Cassio’s side. I’ll put her on that. And I need to take the Moor aside right at the moment when Cassio’s talking to Desdemona, so he’ll see them together. Yes, that’s the way I’ll do it. Let’s not ruin a brilliant plan by being slow to act.</p>
