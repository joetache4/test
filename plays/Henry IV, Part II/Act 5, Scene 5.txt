    m:
      - "I know you not, old man. Get down on your knees and pray, for white hair doesn’t sit well on a fool and a clown. I have dreamed about such a man for a long time: a man so swollen with excess, so old and so obscene. But now that I have awakened, I despise that dream. Let your body lessen, and your manners increase; leave behind your overindulgence, and know that the grave gapes three times as wide for you than any other man. Don’t answer me with a foolish joke. Do not assume that I am what I was; for God knows, I have turned my back on my former self, and I will do the same to those who were my companions. When you hear that I am as I was, then come to me, and you will once again be what you were: the teacher and nurse to my wild, riotous ways. Until then, I banish you, on pain of death, as I have done to the other men who once misled me. Do not come within ten miles of me. I’ll grant you a modest allowance to live on, so that poverty will not lead you into evil. When I hear that you have reformed your ways, I will promote you as you deserve. *(to CHIEF JUSTICE)* It’s your job to see this order carried out. Let’s go."

    m:
      - "Yes, indeed, Sir John. And I’d like to take it home with me."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you grieve at"
      - "this. I shall be sent for in private to him. Look you, he must"
      - "seem thus to the world. Fear not your advancements. I will"
      - "be the man yet that shall make you great."
    m:
      - "That can’t happen, Master Shallow. Don’t let this upset you; I’ll get a private invitation to see him. Look, he has to appear this way to the world. Don’t worry about your good fortunes: I’m still the man who will make you great."

  - sp: SHALLOW
    o:
      - "I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give me your"

      - "John, let me have five hundred of my thousand."
    m:
      - "I don’t know how you’re going to do that, unless you give me your jacket and fill me out with stuffing. Please, Sir John, let me have five hundred of my thousand."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Sir, I will be as good as my word. This that you heard was"
      - "but a color."
    m:
      - "Sir, I’m as good as my word. What you heard here a minute ago was just a color; it was a pretense."

  - sp: SHALLOW
    o:
      - "A color that I fear you will die in, Sir John."
    m:
      - "A color that I fear you’ll be buried in, Sir John."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Fear no colors. Go with me to dinner.—Come, Lieutenant"
      - "Pistol.—Come, Bardolph.—I shall be sent for soon at night."
    m:

      - "He hath intent his wonted followers"
      - "Shall all be very well provided for,"
      - "But all are banished till their conversations"
      - "Appear more wise and modest to the world."
    m:
      - "The King’s fair dealings please me. He wants to ensure that his old companions are provided for, but he banishes them until they can behave more properly and presentably."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "And so they are."
    m:

    m:

  - sp: LANCASTER
    o:
      - "I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,"
      - "We bear our civil swords and native fire"
      - "As far as France: I beard a bird so sing,"
      - "Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the King."
      - "Come, will you hence?"
    m:
      - "I’ll bet that, before the year ends, we’ll launch an invasion of France. I heard a little bird singing about it, and I think the music pleased the King. Come, will you leave with me?"

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."

  - os: "Enter the EPILOGUE."
    ms: "The EPILOGUE enters."

  - o:
      - "First my fear; then my curtsy, last my speech. My fear is your"
      - "displeasure my curtsy my duty; and my speech, to beg your"
      - "pardons. If you look for a good speech now, you undo me,"
      - "for what I have to say is of mine own making, and what"
      - "indeed I should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring."
      - "But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it known to you,"
      - "as it is very well, I was lately here in the end of a displeasing"
      - "play to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better."
      - "I meant indeed to pay you with this, which, if like an ill"
      - "venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle"
      - "creditors, lose. Here I promised you I would be, and here I"
      - "commit my body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I will"
      - "pay you some, and, as most debtors do, promise you"
      - "infinitely. And so I kneel down before you, but, indeed, to"
      - "pray for the Queen."
      - "If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you"
      - "command me to use my legs? And yet that were but light"
      - "payment, to dance out of your debt. But a good conscience"
      - "will make any possible satisfaction, and so would I. All the"
      - "gentlewomen here have forgiven me; if the gentlemen will"
      - "not, then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen,"
      - "which was never seen before in such an assembly."
      - "One word more, I beseech you: if you be not too much"
      - "cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will continue the"
      - "story, with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair"
      - "Katherine of France, where, for anything I know, Falstaff"
      - "shall die of a sweat, unless already he be killed with your"
      - "hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not"
      - "the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are too, I will"
      - "bid you good night."
    m:
      - "First, I’ll tell you what I’m afraid of. Then, I’ll bow, and finally, I’ll make a speech. I fear that this play displeased you; I bow to you out of duty; and finally, I make this speech to ask you for forgiveness. If you’re expecting a good speech now, then I’m in trouble. For I wrote the words I’m about to say, and I’m sure that what I’m about to say will end up getting me in trouble. But I’ll get to the point, and thus I’ll get to the danger. You should know—as you seem to—that I recently came on this stage at the end of some other lousy play, to ask you to be patient and to promise you a better play the next time. I had intended to pay you back for that play with this one. If you didn’t like this play, then—like a businessman who has gambled on a risky venture—I am bankrupt; and you, my sweet creditors, are out of luck. I promised you I would be here, and here I stand to submit myself to your mercy. Give me some mercy and I’ll promise to pay you back again another time. That’s how debtors do it: they always promise to repay. If my talking can’t convince you to let me off the hook, then would you like me to dance? And yet, that would be a cheap payment, to dance myself out of debt. But a person with a good conscience will always seek to pay his debts, and I would do the same. All the women here have forgiven me: if the men won’t, then the men don’t agree with the women, which has never happened in a theater audience before. Just one more thing, if you don’t mind. If fatty meat hasn’t clogged you up yet, our playwright will continue the story with Sir John in it, and entertain you with the beautiful Princess Katharine of France. And speaking of France, as far as I know, Falstaff will die there of the sweating disease—unless, that is, he’s already been killed by your low opinions of him. Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not him. My mouth is tired; when my legs are, too, I’ll say goodnight and take a bow."
