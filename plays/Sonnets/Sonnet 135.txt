      - "Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,"
      - "And Will to boot, and Will in overplus;"
      - "More than enough am I, that vex thee still,"
      - "To thy sweet will making addition thus."
      - "Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,"
      - "Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?"
      - "Shall will in others seem right gracious,"
      - "And in my will no fair acceptance shine?"
      - "The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,"
      - "And in abundance addeth to his store;"
      - "So thou, being rich in Will, add to thy Will"
      - "One will of mine, to make thy large Will more."
      - "  Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;"
      - "  Think all but one, and me in that one Will."

      - "Other women may have their little desires, but you have your Will, and another Will as well, and more Will than you need. I, who am constantly pestering you for sex, am more than enough to satisfy you, adding another willing penis to the Will you already have. Since your sexual desires (and vagina) are both so enormous, won’t you agree just once to let me put my desire inside yours? Are you going to be attracted to everyone else’s will (penis), but reject mine? The sea is entirely made of water, but it still accepts additional water whenever it rains. So you, who already have a William, should in addition to your lover William accept my will (penis), making your sexual appetite (or vagina), which is already huge, even huger. Don’t kill an eager seducer by being unkind to him. Treat all your lovers as a single lover, and accept me (and my part) as part of that lover."
