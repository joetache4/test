<p>Then are we all undone.</p>
<p>It is not possible, it cannot be</p>
<p>The King should keep his word in loving us.</p>
<p>He will suspect us still and find a time</p>
<p>To punish this offense in other faults.</p>
<p>Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes,</p>
<p>For treason is but trusted like the fox,</p>
<p>Who, never so tame, so cherished and locked up,</p>
<p>Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.</p>

<p>My nephew’s trespass may be well forgot;</p>
<p>It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,</p>
<p>And an adopted name of privilege—</p>
<p>A hairbrained Hotspur governed by a spleen:</p>
<p>All his offenses live upon my head</p>
<p>And on his father’s. We did train him on,</p>
<p>And, his corruption being ta’en from us,</p>
<p>We as the spring of all shall pay for all.</p>
<p>Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know</p>
<p>In any case the offer of the King.</p>

<b>WORCESTER</b>
<p>It will be the end of all of us! There is absolutely no way that the King will keep his word and trust us again. He will always be wary of us. He’ll find other reasons to punish us for this rebellion. For the rest of our lives he and his loyalists will look on us with suspicion. Treason is like a fox: you can tame it, care for it, and put it in a cage, but it will always have the wild instincts it inherited from its ancestors. No matter how we look—sad or happy—people will interpret our looks in the worst possible light. We’ll be like oxen in a stall: the better they’re fed, the closer they are to being slaughtered. My nephew’s disloyalty might be forgiven: his young age and hot temper will excuse it. Plus, his nickname gives him permission: Hotspur the Harebrain, always flaring up. All his offenses will be blamed on me and his father. After all, we encouraged him, and since we taught him to be angry at the King, we’ll pay for it. So cousin, don’t by any means let Harry know what the King offered.</p>

<p>No, by my soul. I never in my life</p>
<p>Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,</p>
<p>Unless a brother should a brother dare</p>
<p>To gentle exercise and proof of arms.</p>
<p>He gave you all the duties of a man,</p>
<p>Trimmed up your praises with a princely tongue,</p>
<p>Spoke your deservings like a chronicle,</p>
<p>Making you ever better than his praise</p>
<p>By still dispraising praise valued in you,</p>
<p>And, which became him like a prince indeed,</p>
<p>He made a blushing cital of himself,</p>
<p>And chid his truant youth with such a grace</p>
<p>As if he mastered there a double spirit</p>
<p>Of teaching and of learning instantly.</p>
<p>There did he pause: but let me tell the world:</p>
<p>If he outlive the envy of this day,</p>
<p>England did never owe so sweet a hope,</p>
<p>So much misconstrued in his wantonness.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>VERNON</b>
<p>No, I swear; I never heard a challenge issued more gracefully. It was like a brother asking a brother to a little friendly competition. He paid you all due respect, and he summed up your good qualities in the most princely language. He spoke of how deserving you are, as though he were your biographer. He claimed you were even above praise, for simple praise could never measure up to your true merits. And he gave a modest account of himself, as well, which made him seem like a true prince indeed. He berated himself for having behaved wildly, but he said this so gracefully that he sounded like a teacher giving a lesson and a student learning one at the same time. There he stopped, but let me say this: if he survives this battle, then England never had a sweeter hope, nor one so misunderstood in his recklessness.</p>

<p>But be he as he will, yet once ere night</p>
<p>I will embrace him with a soldier’s arm,</p>
<p>That he shall shrink under my courtesy.—</p>
<p>Arm, arm with speed, and, fellows, soldiers, friends,</p>
<p>Better consider what you have to do</p>
<p>Than I that have not well the gift of tongue</p>
<p>Can lift your blood up with persuasion.</p>

<b>HOTSPUR</b>
<p>I think you’ve been charmed by his foolishness. I’ve never heard of a Prince who was so wild and loose. But however he wants to seem, before night falls I will embrace him with these soldier’s arms, and he will tremble at my affection. Get ready, get ready quickly! And friends, partners, soldiers, take a moment to think for yourselves about what you have to do. I’m not a good enough speaker to motivate you.</p>
