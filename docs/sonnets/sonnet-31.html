<p>Thy bosom is endearèd with all hearts</p>

<p>And all those friends which I thought burièd.</p>

<p>But things removed that hidden in thee lie.</p>
<p>Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,</p>
<p>Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,</p>
<p>Who all their parts of me to thee did give;</p>
<p>That due of many now is thine alone.</p>
<p>Their images I loved I view in thee,</p>

<p>You have the love of everyone who used to love me, people who I supposed were dead because I didn’t have their love anymore. Love reigns in your heart—both everything belonging to love and all those friends who I thought were dead and buried. How many tears of devoted love have I shed at funerals, in payment to the dead, when now it appears they had only gone to hide in your heart. You’re like a grave where dead lovers come alive again, decorated with mementos of those lost loves who gave you all the love I owed to each of them. All the love I owed to many is now yours alone. I see these lovers in you, and you, who contain everyone I have ever loved or was loved by, have all of me.</p>
