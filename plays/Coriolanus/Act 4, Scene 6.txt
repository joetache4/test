      - "About their functions friendly."
    m:
      - "We haven’t heard about him, so we don’t need to fear him. It would be easy to deal with him now, given the peace and quietness of the people, who were in such chaos before. Now we’re making his friends blush because things are going so smoothly. His friends are the ones who would’ve chosen—to their own detriment—to see people arguing in the streets rather than have our tradesmen back in their shops and happily doing their jobs."

    m:
      - "Coriolanus is not missed much by anyone but his friends now. The people would rise up against him if he were still angry at them."

      - "All’s well; and might have been much better, if"

    m:

    o:
      - "’Tis Aufidius,"
      - "Who, hearing of our Martius’ banishment,"

      - "And durst not once peep out."
    m:
      - "It’s Aufidius. Hearing of Martius’ banishment, he’s thrusting his horns into the world again. When Martius defended Rome, Aufidius was contained and didn’t once dare to strike out."

      - "Of what is to be dreaded."
    m:
      - "They can’t? We’ve seen many times that they very well can, three times within my own lifetime in fact. Talk with the prisoner before you beat him. Find out where he heard this. Don’t run the risk of punishing the informant who warns you of dreaded news."

    m:

      - "The slave’s report is seconded; and more,"
      - "More fearful, is deliver’d."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "What more fearful?"
    m:
      - "What could be worse?"

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "It is spoke freely out of many mouths—"
      - "How probable I do not know—that Martius,"
      - "Join’d with Aufidius, leads a power ’gainst Rome,"
      - "And vows revenge as spacious as between"
      - "The young’st and oldest thing."
    m:
      - "Many people, though I don’t know how much they actually know, are openly declaring that Martius has joined with Aufidius and is leading an army against Rome and that he vows revenge on everyone alive."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "This is most likely!"
    m:
      - "This is highly likely!"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:

      - "Good Martius home again."
    m:
      - "The weak common people have only been incited in order to welcome Martius home again."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "The very trick on’t."
    m:
      - "It’s a trick."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "This is unlikely:"
      - "He and Aufidius can no more atone"
      - "Than violentest contrariety."
    m:
      - "That’s unlikely. He and Aufidius can’t agree on anything other than to fight each other."

      - "Upon our territories; and have already"
      - "O’erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took"
      - "What lay before them."
    m:
      - "You’ve been called to the Senate. A frightening army, led by Caius Martius and in conjunction with Aufidius, rages in our territories. They’ve already overcome everything in their way, burned it, and took whatever was left."

    m:
      - "What’s the news? What’s the news?"

    o:

      - "Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined"
      - "Into an auger’s bore."
    m:
      - "Your temples have been burned down to their foundations, and your political power reduced to the size of a pinhole."

    o:
      - "If!"

      - "Made by some other deity than nature,"
      - "That shapes man better; and they follow him,"
      - "Against us brats, with no less confidence"
      - "Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,"
      - "Or butchers killing flies."
    m:
      - "If? Then he is their god. He leads them as if he were a thing made by some other deity than nature, one that makes stronger men. And they follow him, against us children, with the confidence of boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "You have made good work,"
      - "You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much"
      - "on the voice of occupation and"
      - "The breath of garlic-eaters!"
    m:
      - "*(to the tribunes)* This is all your doing, you and the tradesmen you represent. You that built your power on the workmen’s votes and the wishes of the lower class!"

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:

      - "Your Rome about your ears."
    m:

      - "You have made fair work!"
    m:
      - "The city is ready to fall like the ripe fruits Hercules had to shake down from the trees. You are responsible for all of this!"

    o:
      - "But is this true, sir?"
    m:
      - "But is this true, sir?"

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:
      - "Ay; and you’ll look pale"
      - "Before you find it other. All the regions"
      - "Do smilingly revolt; and who resist"
      - "Are mock’d for valiant ignorance,"
      - "And perish constant fools. Who is’t can blame him?"
      - "Your enemies and his find something in him."
    m:
      - "Yes, and you’ll be dead before it’s otherwise. All the regions are revolting. Whoever resists is mocked for their ignorant courage and then killed as a loyal fool. Who can blame Martius? Your enemies and his find something in him."

    o:
      - "We are all undone, unless"

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:
      - "Who shall ask it?"

      - "Deserve such pity of him as the wolf"
      - "Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they"
      - "Should say “Be good to Rome,” they charged him even"
      - "As those should do that had deserved his hate,"
      - "And therein show’d like enemies."
    m:
      - "Who will ask him for mercy? The tribunes are too ashamed, the people deserve his pity like the wolf deserves the shepherds’, and as for his best friends, if they were to ask him to “be good to Rome,” they would be asking of him what his enemies ought to ask, and that would make them appear to be his enemies."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "’Tis true:"
      - "If he were putting to my house the brand"
      - "That should consume it, I have not the face"
      - "To say “Beseech you, cease.” You have made fair hands,"
      - "You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!"
    m:
      - "It’s true. If he were about to burn my house, I wouldn’t be bold enough to say, “I beg you, stop.” You and your crafty ways! You’ve crafted a real mess here!"

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:
      - "You have brought"
      - "A trembling upon Rome, such as was never"

  - sp: BOTH TRIBUNES
    o:
      - "Say not we brought it."
    m:

    o:
      - "How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts"
      - "And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,"
      - "Who did hoot him out o’ the city."
    m:
      - "What? How is it our fault? We supported him but, like beasts and cowardly nobles, we gave way into your crowds of people who drove him out of the city."

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:
      - "But I fear"
      - "They’ll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,"
      - "The second name of men, obeys his points"
      - "As if he were his officer: desperation"
      - "Is all the policy, strength and defence,"
      - "That Rome can make against them."
    m:
      - "But I fear the crowds will roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius, the second most famous warrior, obeys Martius’ orders as if he were his officer. Desperation is the only defense that Rome can make against them."

    ms: "A troop of Citizens enter."

    o:

      - "Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at"
      - "Coriolanus’ exile. Now he’s coming;"
      - "And not a hair upon a soldier’s head"
      - "Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs"
      - "As you threw caps up will he tumble down,"
      - "And pay you for your voices. ’Tis no matter;"
      - "if he could burn us all into one coal,"
      - "We have deserved it."
    m:
      - "Here come the crowds. Is Aufidius with him? You’re the ones that made the air unwholesome when you tossed up your stinking greasy caps, hooting at Coriolanus’ exile. Now he’s coming, and there’s not a hair on a soldier’s head that won’t become a whip. He’ll cut off every fool’s head that had tossed up a hat to repay you for your votes. If he could burn us all into one coal, we would deserve it."

      - "it was against our will."
    m:
