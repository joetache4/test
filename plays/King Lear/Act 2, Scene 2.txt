    o:
      - "Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this house?"
    m:
      - "Good morning to you, friend. Do you work in this house?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Ay."
    m:
      - "Yes, I do."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "Where may we set our horses?"
    m:
      - "Where should we stable our horses?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "I’ th’ mire."
    m:
      - "In the mud."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me."
    m:
      - "Please, sir, be kind to me and tell me."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "I love thee not."
    m:
      - "I won’t be kind to you."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "Why, then, I care not for thee."
    m:
      - "In that case, I don’t much care for you either."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee care for me."
    m:
      - "If I could get my hands on you, I’d make you care."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not."
    m:
      - "Why are you talking to me like this? I don’t even know you."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Fellow, I know thee."
    m:
      - "Ah, but I know you."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "What dost thou know me for?"
    m:
      - "Who am I then?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "A knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking knave; a whoreson, glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue; one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good service; and art nothing but the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch; one whom I will beat into clamorous whining if thou deniest the least syllable of thy addition."
    m:
      - "You’re a lowlife, a rascal who eats leftover scraps. You’re an ignoble, arrogant, shallow, vulgar, pretentious, conceited, filthy third-rate servant who thinks he’s something special. You’re a cowardly lawyer-loving bastard; a vain, brown-nosing, prissy scoundrel who’d pimp himself out to advance his career; a bag lady. You’re nothing but a lowlife, a beggar, a coward, and a pimp, the son and heir of a mutt bitch. I’ll beat you until you whine and cry if you deny the least bit of this."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!"
    m:
      - "What an ogre you are to slander someone you don’t know, and who doesn’t know you!"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "What a brazen-faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king? Draw, you rogue, for though it be night yet the moon shines. I’ll make a sop o’ th’ moonshine of you. *(draws his sword)* Draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw!"
    m:
      - "What a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don’t know me! It was just two days ago that I tripped you and beat you up in front of the king. Draw your sword, scoundrel. It may be nighttime, but there’s enough moonlight to fight by. I’ll make ground beef out of you. *(he draws his sword)* Draw, you affected, preening son of a bitch! Draw your sword!"

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "Away! I have nothing to do with thee."
    m:
      - "Get away from me! I’ve got nothing to do with you."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Draw, you rascal. You come with letters against the king and take Vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her father. Draw, you rogue, or I’ll so carbonado your shanks. Draw, you rascal! Come your ways."
    m:
      - "Draw your sword, you jerk! You come here with letters against the king, and you take his conceited daughter’s side against his royal highness. Draw your sword, scoundrel, or I’ll slice your thighs like flank steak. Draw your sword! Come on!"

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "Help, ho! Murder! Help!"
    m:
      - "Help! Murderer! Help!"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Strike, you slave. Stand, rogue. Stand, you neat slave, strike! *(strikes OSWALD)*"
    m:
      - "Fight, peasant. Don’t run away, scoundrel. Stand and fight, you overdressed servant, fight! *(he hits OSWALD)*"

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "Help, ho! Murder, murder!"
    m:
      - "Help! Murder, murder!"

    ms: "EDMUND enters with his sword drawn, followed by the Duke of CORNWALL, the Duchess REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and servants."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "How now? What’s the matter? Part."
    m:
      - "What’s going on here? Get away from each other."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "*(to EDMUND)* With you, goodman boy, if you please. Come,"
      - "I’ll flesh ye. Come on, young master."
    m:
      - "*(to EDMUND)* Well, kid, let’s see you fight. Come on, I’ll show you how."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "Weapons, arms? What’s the matter here?"
    m:
      - "You have weapons? What’s going on here?"

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "Keep peace, upon your lives."
      - "He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?"
    m:
      - "Stop it, I order you. The next person to strike again dies. What’s going on here?"

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "The messengers from our sister and the king."
    m:
      - "These are the messengers from my sister and the king."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "What is your difference? Speak."
    m:
      - "What are you fighting about? Tell me."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "I am scarce in breath, my lord."
    m:
      - "I’m out of breath, sir."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "No marvel, you have so bestirred your valor. You cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee. A tailor made thee."
    m:
      - "No wonder, with all your exertions, you cowardly rascal. You’re not worth being called a man. The only thing manly about you are your clothes. A tailor made you."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man?"
    m:
      - "That’s an odd thing to say. How can a tailor make a person?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Ay, a tailor, sir. A stone-cutter or painter could not have made him so ill though they had been but two years o’ th’ trade."
    m:
      - "Definitely a tailor, sir. A sculptor or a painter couldn’t have screwed him up as bad as that, even as an apprentice."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "Speak yet. How grew your quarrel?"
    m:
      - "But tell me what you’re fighting about."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared at suit of his gray beard—"
    m:
      - "This old ruffian here, whom I didn’t kill because he’s so old—"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Thou whoreson zed, thou unnecessary letter!—My lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall of a jakes with him.—Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?"
    m:
      - "You useless bastard—you’re like the letter “z,” a totally unnecessary addition to the alphabet.—My lord, please let me grind this lumpy lowlife into a powder and use it to plaster up the bathroom walls.—You didn’t kill me because I’m so old, you fawning dog?"

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "Peace, sirrah!"
      - "You beastly knave, know you no reverence?"
    m:
      - "Calm down. Don’t you have any manners, you savage?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege."
    m:
      - "Yes, sir, but not when I’m enraged."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "Why art thou angry?"
    m:
      - "Why are you enraged?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "That such a slave as this should wear a sword,"
      - "Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,"
      - "Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain"
      - "Which are too intrinse t’ unloose, smooth every passion"
      - "That in the natures of their lords rebel,"
      - "Bring oil to fire, snow to the colder moods;"
      - "Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks"
      - "With every gale and vary of their masters,"
      - "Knowing naught, like dogs, but following.—"
      - "A plague upon your epileptic visage!"
      - "Smile you my speeches as I were a fool?"
      - "Goose, an I had you upon Sarum plain,"
      - "I’d drive ye cackling home to Camelot."
    m:
      - "I’m angry that a dishonorable lowlife like this wears a sword like a gentleman. Smiling swindlers such as he undo the sacred bonds that unite people together, and only encourage the unreasonable passions of their masters. They foster both rage and apathy. They say “Yes” and “No,” turning their noses whichever way the wind blows without taking a firm stance on anything. They blindly follow their masters’ impulses, like dogs.—Damn your ugly stinking face! Are you laughing at what I say, as if I were a fool? If I had my way with you right now, I’d send you to back to where you came from."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "Why, art thou mad, old fellow?"
    m:
      - "Are you insane, old man?"

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "*(to KENT)*      How fell you out?"
      - "Say that."
    m:
      - "*(to KENT)* What did you start quarreling over? Just tell us."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "No contraries hold more antipathy"
      - "Than I and such a knave."
    m:
      - "I couldn’t hate that jerk over there any more than I do."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "Why dost thou call him “knave”? What’s his offense?"
    m:
      - "Why are you calling him a jerk? What did he do to you?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "His countenance likes me not."
    m:
      - "I don’t like his face."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "No more perchance does mine, nor his, nor hers."
    m:
      - "But maybe you don’t like mine, or his, or hers either."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Sir, ’tis my occupation to be plain."
      - "I have seen better faces in my time"
      - "Than stands on any shoulder that I see"
      - "Before me at this instant."
    m:
      - "I’m used to telling the truth, sir, and I have to say that I’ve seen better faces than those I see here."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "  This is some fellow,"
      - "Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect"
      - "A saucy roughness and constrains the garb"
      - "Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he."
      - "An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth."
      - "An they will take it, so. If not, he’s plain."
      - "These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness"
      - "Harbor more craft and more corrupter ends"
      - "Than twenty silly-ducking observants"
      - "That stretch their duties nicely."
    m:
      - "This is a guy who’s been praised for his honest bluntness, and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words. No flattery for him, no sir! He’s honest, he’s got to speak the truth. If people take what he says, fine. If not, he’s got truth on his side! I know his type. He’s sneaky behind all his so-called bluntness, sneakier than twenty brown-nosing bootlickers who only tell you what you want to hear."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Sir, in good faith, or in sincere verity,"
      - "Under th’ allowance of your great aspect,"
      - "Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire"
      - "On flickering Phoebus’ front—"
    m:
      - "Dearest, kindest, most honorable sir, may I say, with your esteemed approval, which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun-god Phoebus, that—"

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "    What mean’st by this?"
    m:
      - "What do you mean by that?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave, which for my part I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to ’t."
    m:
      - "I tried to stop speaking plainly, since you dislike plain speech so much. Sir, I know I’m not a flatterer. The guy who tricked you with plain language was just a plain crook—which I’m not, however much I may displease you by not being one."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "*(to OSWALD)* What was th’ offense you gave him?"
    m:
      - "*(to OSWALD)* How did you offend him?"

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "    I never gave him any."
      - "It pleased the king his master very late"
      - "To strike at me upon his misconstruction"
      - "When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,"
      - "Tripped me behind; being down, insulted, railed,"
      - "And put upon him such a deal of man"
      - "That worthied him, got praises of the king"
      - "For him attempting who was self-subdued."
      - "And in the fleshment of this dread exploit"
      - "Drew on me here again."
    m:
      - "I never offended him at all. Recently, the king hit me because of a misunderstanding. This man took sides with the king and tripped me. When I was down on the ground he insulted me, and then started acting tough to seem courageous in front of the king. The king praised him, even though I had never offered any resistance at all. Now he pulled out his sword on me again, still riled up from our first encounter."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "  None of these rogues and cowards"
      - "But Ajax is their fool."
    m:
      - "These cowards manage to make fools of brave men."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "  Fetch forth the stocks, ho!—"
      - "You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,"
      - "We’ll teach you."
    m:
      - "Bring out the stocks !—We’ll teach you, you stubborn old bastard, you arrogant show-off."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "  Sir, I am too old to learn."
      - "Call not your stocks for me. I serve the king,"
      - "On whose employment I was sent to you."
      - "You shall do small respect, show too bold malice"
      - "Against the grace and person of my master,"
      - "Stocking his messenger."
    m:
      - "Sir, I’m too old to be taught anything. Don’t put me in the stocks. I serve the king, who sent me here. If you put me in the stocks you’ll insult him both as a king and as a man."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "  Fetch forth the stocks!"
      - "As I have life and honor, there shall he sit till noon."
    m:
      - "Bring out the stocks! I swear on my life and honor, he’ll sit here in the stocks until noon."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too."
    m:
      - "Only until noon, my lord? No, the whole day, and all night too."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog,"
      - "You should not use me so."
    m:
      - "Ma’am, you wouldn’t treat me like this if I were your father’s dog."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "  Sir, being his knave, I will."
    m:
      - "But since you’re his scoundrel servant, I will."

  - os: "Stocks brought out"
    ms: "The stocks are brought out."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "This is a fellow of the selfsame color"
      - "Our sister speaks of.—Come, bring away the stocks!"
    m:
      - "This guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about.—Come on, bring in the stocks, now!"

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "Let me beseech your grace not to do so."
      - "His fault is much, and the good king his master"
      - "Will check him for ’t. Your purposed low correction"
      - "Is such as basest and contemned’st wretches"
      - "For pilferings and most common trespasses"
      - "Are punished with."
      - "The king his master needs must take it ill,"
      - "That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,"
      - "Should have him thus restrained."
    m:
      - "I beg you not to do this, my lord. He’s done wrong, and his master the king will punish him for it. But the kind of punishment you propose is more suited to petty shoplifters than to royal attendants. The king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "    I’ll answer that."
    m:
      - "I’ll take responsibility for that."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "My sister may receive it much more worse"
      - "To have her gentleman abused, assaulted"
      - "For following her affairs.—Put in his legs."
    m:
      - "My sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders.—Put his legs in the stocks."

  - os: "KENT is put in the stocks"
    ms: "KENT is put in the stocks."

  - sp: CORNWALL
    o:
      - "*(to GLOUCESTER)* Come, my good lord, away."
    m:
      - "*(to GLOUCESTER)* Let’s go, my lord."

  - os: "Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT"
    ms: "Everyone exits except GLOUCESTER and KENT."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "I am sorry for thee, friend. ’Tis the duke’s pleasure,"
      - "Whose disposition, all the world well knows,"
      - "Will not be rubbed nor stopped. I’ll entreat for thee."
    m:
      - "I’m sorry, my friend. The duke always gets it his way, and everyone knows you can’t budge him once he’s made up his mind. I’ll try talking to him again."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Pray you do not, sir. I have watched and traveled hard."
      - "Some time I shall sleep out. The rest I’ll whistle."
      - "A good man’s fortune may grow out at heels."
      - "Give you good morrow."
    m:
      - "Please don’t, sir. I’ve been up for a long time and have done a lot of traveling recently. This punishment will be a good chance to catch up on my sleep. The rest of the time I’ll whistle to entertain myself. Even good men have bad luck. Have a good morning."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "The duke’s to blame in this. ’Twill be ill taken."
    m:
      - "It’s wrong for the duke to do this. The king will be angry with him."

  - os: "Exit GLOUCESTER"
    ms: "GLOUCESTER exits."

      - "*(takes out a letter)*"
      - "Approach, thou beacon to this underglobe,"
      - "That by thy comfortable beams I may"
      - "Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles"
      - "But misery. I know ’tis from Cordelia,"
      - "Who hath most fortunately been informed"
      - "Of my obscurèd course and *(reads the letter)* “shall find time"
      - "From this enormous state, seeking to give"
      - "Losses their remedies.” All weary and o’erwatched,"
      - "Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold"
      - "This shameful lodging."
      - "Fortune, good night. Smile once more. Turn thy wheel."
      - "*(sleeps)*"
    m:
      - "Oh, good King Lear, you’re proving that, just as they say, everything goes from good to bad. *(he takes out a letter)* Rise and shine, sun, so I can read this letter. Only those who are truly miserable see miracles. I know this letter is from Cordelia, who knows that I’m serving the king in disguise. *(looking at the letter)* She says that she will have time, now that she’s away from the monstrous conditions here, to find a way to fix things. I’m exhausted. I’ve been awake too long. This fatigue gives me an excuse to shut my eyes so I can’t see myself humiliated in the stocks. Good night, Lady Luck. Smile and spin your wheel of fortune again. *(he sleeps)*"
