      - "Julia, farewell!"
    m:
      - "Here is my hand to show my fidelity. And if an hour in the day passes when I don’t sigh when thinking of you, Julia, then may some disaster torment me in the next hour to punish my love’s forgetfulness! My father is waiting for me. Don’t say anything. The tide is right for me to set out—no, not your tide of tears. Those tears will keep me here longer than I should stay. Farewell, Julia!"

  - o:
      - "What, gone without a word?"

      - "For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it."
    m:
      - "What, she’s gone without saying a word? Yes, that’s how it should be with true love. It cannot speak, because truth is best expressed through action, not words."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
