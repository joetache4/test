<p>Orsino, sir, please don’t call me those names. I was never a thief or a pirate, though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons. I came here because someone put a spell on me. I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning. He was a wreck, almost past hope. I saved his life and gave him my love, without reservation. I dedicated myself to him. For his sake I ran the risk of revisiting this unfriendly town, and I drew my sword to defend him when he was in trouble. But when the police caught us, he was clever and treacherous enough to pretend he’d never met me before. He acted like someone who barely knew me. He refused to give me my own wallet, which I had lent him only half an hour before.</p>

<p><em>(handing a paper)</em></p>
<p>Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.</p>
<p>You must not now deny it is your hand.</p>
<p>Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase;</p>
<p>Or say ’tis not your seal, not your invention:</p>
<p>You can say none of this. Well, grant it then</p>
<p>And tell me, in the modesty of honor,</p>
<p>Why you have given me such clear lights of favor,</p>
<p>Bade me come smiling and cross-gartered to you,</p>
<p>To put on yellow stockings, and to frown</p>
<p>Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people?</p>
<p>And, acting this in an obedient hope,</p>
<p>Why have you suffered me to be imprisoned,</p>
<p>Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,</p>
<p>And made the most notorious geck and gull</p>
<p>That e’er invention played on? Tell me why.</p>

<b>MALVOLIO</b>
<p><em>(he hands OLIVIA a paper)</em> You did. Please have a look at this letter. You can’t deny that it’s your handwriting. Go ahead and try to write differently, and try to pretend that’s not your seal with your design on it. You can’t. So just admit it. And tell me honestly, why did you show me such fondness and asked me to smile at you, wear yellow stockings and crisscrossed laces for you, and be rude to Sir Toby and the servants? And then tell me why you imprisoned me in a dark house after I followed your instructions perfectly. You made me look like the biggest fool that anybody ever tricked. Tell me why you did it.</p>

<p>Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,</p>
<p>Though, I confess, much like the character.</p>
<p>But out of question, ’tis Maria’s hand.</p>
<p>And now I do bethink me, it was she</p>
<p>First told me thou wast mad, then camest in smiling,</p>
<p>And in such forms which here were presupposed</p>
<p>Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content.</p>
<p>This practice hath most shrewdly passed upon thee;</p>
<p>But when we know the grounds and authors of it,</p>
<p>Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge</p>
<p>Of thine own cause.</p>

<b>OLIVIA</b>
<p>I’m sorry, Malvolio, but this isn’t my writing, though I admit it looks like mine. It’s definitely Maria’s handwriting. Now that I think about it, Maria was the one who first told me you were insane. That’s when you came in smiling at me, dressed up like the letter said, and acting just like it told you to act. Someone has played a very mean trick on you, but when we find out who’s responsible, you won’t just be the victim, but the judge who sentences the culprit. I promise.</p>

<p>Good madam, hear me speak,</p>
<p>And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come</p>
<p>Taint the condition of this present hour,</p>
<p>Which I have wonder’d at. In hope it shall not,</p>
<p>Most freely I confess, myself and Toby</p>
<p>Set this device against Malvolio here,</p>
<p>Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts</p>
<p>We had conceived against him. Maria writ</p>
<p>The letter at Sir Toby’s great importance,</p>
<p>In recompense whereof he hath married her.</p>
<p>How with a sportful malice it was followed,</p>
<p>May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,</p>
<p>If that the injuries be justly weighed</p>
<p>That have on both sides passed.</p>

<b>FABIAN</b>
<p>Madam, let me say something. Please don’t let squabbles ruin this beautiful and miraculous moment. I confess that Toby and I were the ones who tricked Malvolio because we hated his strict and heavy-handed ways. Sir Toby had Maria wrote that letter, and he married her as a reward. We should just laugh about the whole thing rather than get upset about it, especially if we consider that each of the two parties offended the other equally.</p>

<p>Well, you know, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.” Anyway, I was part of the trick, sir. I pretended to be a priest named Sir Topas. But what does it matter? <em>(he imitates MALVOLIO)</em> “I swear, fool, I’m not crazy.”—But do you remember what he said about me before? “I’m surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker—unless he’s got somebody laughing at him, he can’t think of anything to say.” What goes around comes around.</p>
