<p>Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ’rayed? Was ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they are coming after to warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself. For, considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold.—Holla, ho! Curtis!</p>

<p>To hell with all worn-out horses, all crazy masters, and all bad roads. Was a man ever beaten as much as me? Was a man ever as dirty as me? Was a man ever so tired? I have been sent on ahead to light a fire, and they are coming after to warm themselves. It’s a good thing I’m like a little pot and warm up quickly, or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, and my heart would freeze in my belly, before I managed to get thawed out. I’ll warm myself by blowing on the fire. A taller man than I would catch cold in weather like this. Hey! Curtis! Hello!</p>

<p>It’s burnt. The whole thing is burnt. You bastards! Where is that moron of a cook? You devils! How dare you serve it to me this way!

<p>And I’m telling you it was burnt and dried out. I’m not allowed to eat overcooked meat. It gives me indigestion and that makes me irritable. Very, very irritable.Better for us to go hungry, since we’re both hotheaded, than for us to eat meat that’s been cooked too long. But don’t worry, tomorrow it will get straightened out. Tonight we’ll go without food. Come, I’ll show you your bridal chamber.</p>

<p>Thus have I politicly begun my reign,</p>

<p>Well, I’ve begun my reign with a carefully thought-out plan, and I have every hope of succeeding. My falcon is now hungry and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me, for if her hunger is satisfied, she’ll pay no attention to the bait. I have another plan to make my bird come to me and recognize her owner’s call is to keep her from sleeping—</p>

<p>That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites</p>
<p>That bate and beat and will not be obedient.</p>
<p>She ate no meat today, nor none shall eat.</p>
<p>Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not.</p>
<p>As with the meat, some undeservèd fault</p>
<p>I’ll find about the making of the bed,</p>
<p>And here I’ll fling the pillow, there the bolster,</p>
<p>This way the coverlet, another way the sheets.</p>
<p>Ay, and amid this hurly I intend</p>
<p>That all is done in reverend care of her.</p>
<p>And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night,</p>
<p>And if she chance to nod I’ll rail and brawl,</p>
<p>And with the clamor keep her still awake.</p>
<p>This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,</p>
<p>And thus I’ll curb her mad and headstrong humor.</p>
<p>He that knows better how to tame a shrew,</p>
<p>Now let him speak; ’tis charity to show.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>PETRUCHIO</b>
<p>the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey. She had no food today and will have none. Last night she got no sleep, and she won’t get any tonight. Just as I did with the meat, I’ll make up some problem with the way the bed is made, and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other, and the blanket over here and the sheets over there. And through all the shouting and fuss, I’ll swear that it’s all out of love for her. The end result will be that she’ll sit up all night. And if she starts to drop off, I’ll rant and yell until I wake her up. This is how to kill a wife with kindness. And this way I’ll cure her wild and willful nature. If anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew, speak up, please. It would be much appreciated.</p>
