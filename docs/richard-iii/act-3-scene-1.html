<p>You are too inexplicably stubborn, my lord, too stuck on ceremony. In these less dainty times, you’re not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him. It’s only a sanctuary for those who really need protection or those who are smart enough to claim they do. The prince has done neither; therefore, in my opinion, he isn’t really protected by sanctuary. You’re not breaking any holy laws to take him away. Often I have heard of “sanctuary men,” but until now I’ve never heard of “sanctuary children.”</p>

<b>BUCKINGHAM</b>
<p>Okay, just do this, noble Catesby: sound out Lord Hastings, but make it seem as if you’re just mulling over the idea, that it hasn’t been firmed up yet. Invite him to come to the Tower tomorrow for the coronation ceremony. If he seems game to our plan, encourage him to join us and explain all our reasons. But if he’s resistant and chilly, then be like that too and break off the conversation. Let us know how he responds. Tomorrow we’re going to hold two separate meetings, one for those who are with us and one for those who aren’t. You’ll have a lot to do in these meetings.</p>
