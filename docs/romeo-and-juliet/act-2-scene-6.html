<p>Amen, amen. But come what sorrow can,</p>
<p>It cannot countervail the exchange of joy</p>
<p>That one short minute gives me in her sight.</p>
<p>Do thou but close our hands with holy words,</p>

<p>Amen, amen. But whatever misfortunes occur, they can’t ruin the joy I feel with one look at her. All you have to do is join our hands with holy words, then love-destroying death can do whatever it pleases. It’s enough for me if I can call her mine.</p>

<p>These violent delights have violent ends</p>
<p>And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,</p>
<p>Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey</p>
<p>Is loathsome in his own deliciousness</p>
<p>And in the taste confounds the appetite.</p>
<p>Therefore love moderately. Long love doth so.</p>
<p>Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.</p>

<b>FRIAR LAWRENCE</b>
<p>These sudden joys have sudden endings. They burn up in victory like fire and gunpowder. When they meet, as in a kiss, they explode. Too much honey is delicious, but it makes you sick to your stomach. Therefore, love each other in moderation. That is the key to long-lasting love. Too fast is as bad as too slow.</p>
