<b>KING HENRY</b>
<p>Thank you, I’m sure. My learned lord, kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this French Salic law either should or shouldn’t bar me in my claim. And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord, that you should invent, twist, or distort your interpretation, or burden your conscience by subtly arguing for false claims. For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do. So think carefully before you incite me to wage war. I charge you, in the name of God, be careful what you say. For mighty kingdoms such as England and France have never gone to war with one another without much bloodshed, every innocent drop of which cries out against the wrongdoer who caused such loss of life without good reason. With this in mind, speak, my lord. And I will listen, consider, and earnestly believe that what you say is spoken with a conscience as pure as a newly baptized soul.</p>

<p>Established then this law: to wit, no female</p>

<p>Which “Salic,” as I said, ’twixt Elbe and Sala</p>
<p>Is at this day in Germany called Meissen.</p>
<p>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers</p>

<p>Which “Salic,” as I said, ’twixt Elbe and Sala</p>
<p>Is at this day in Germany called Meissen.</p>
<p>Then doth it well appear the Salic law</p>
<p>Was not devisèd for the realm of France,</p>
<p>Nor did the French possess the Salic land</p>
<p>Until four hundred one and twenty years</p>
<p>After defunction of King Pharamond,</p>
<p>Idly supposed the founder of this law;</p>
<p>Who died within the year of our redemption</p>
<p>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</p>
<p>Subdued the Saxons and did seat the French</p>
<p>Beyond the river Sala in the year</p>
<p>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</p>
<p>King Pepin, which deposèd Childeric,</p>
<p>Did, as heir general, being descended</p>
<p>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</p>
<p>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</p>
<p>Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</p>
<p>Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</p>
<p>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</p>
<p>To find his title with some shows of truth,</p>
<p>Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,</p>
<p>Conveyed himself as th’ heir to th’ Lady Lingare,</p>
<p>Daughter to Charlemagne, who was the son</p>
<p>To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son</p>
<p>Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</p>
<p>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</p>
<p>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</p>
<p>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</p>
<p>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</p>
<p>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</p>
<p>Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine,</p>
<p>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</p>
<p>Was reunited to the crown of France.</p>
<p>So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun,</p>
<p>King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim,</p>
<p>King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</p>
<p>To hold in right and title of the female.</p>
<p>So do the kings of France unto this day,</p>
<p>Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law</p>
<p>To bar your Highness claiming from the female</p>
<p>And rather choose to hide them in a net</p>
<p>Than amply to imbar their crooked titles</p>
<p>Usurped from you and your progenitors.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>CANTERBURY</b>
<p>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne. There is no legal obstacle to your Highness’ claim to France except the following rule, which the French cite from King Pharamond: <em>In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant</em> (No woman shall inherit property in the Salic land). The French wrongly interpret “the Salic land” to mean France, and they cite Pharamond as the founder of this law that bars female succession to the throne. But their own authors assert that the Salic land is in Germany, between the Sala and the Elbe rivers, where Charles the Great left behind certain French settlements after conquering the Saxons. The French settlers despised the German women because they were unfaithful to their husbands, so the settlers passed this law that no woman should have right of inheritance in Salic land. And the Salic land—the region between the Elbe and the Sala, in Germany, as I said—is now called Meissen. It is clear, then, that the Salic law was not intended for the realm of France. Nor did the French possess the Salic land until four hundred twenty-one years after the death of King Pharamond, incorrectly thought to be the founder of the law. He died in the year 426, and Charles the Great conquered the Saxons and settled Frenchmen in the region beyond the river Sala in the year 805. Besides, according to the French historians, King Pepin, who deposed Childeric, based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild, the daughter of King Clothair. Another case: Hugh Capet, who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine—sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great—passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare, daughter of Charlemagne, who was the son of Lewis the Emperor (who was the son of Charles the Great), in order to give his claim to the throne more validity (though, in fact, the claim was completely false and worthless). Another case: King Lewis the Tenth, who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel, his grandmother, was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare, daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine, by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France. Thus, it should be clear as day that King Pepin’s title, Hugh Capet’s claim, and the resolution of King Lewis’ doubts all plainly derive from the female. To this day, the kings of France follow this unspoken rule, even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line. They prefer to obscure matters rather than reveal how corrupt their own claims to the French crown are. They usurped that crown from you and your ancestors.</p>

<p>End in one purpose, and be all well borne</p>
<p>Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege!</p>
<p>Divide your happy England into four,</p>
<p>Whereof take you one quarter into France,</p>
<p>And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.</p>
<p>If we, with thrice such powers left at home,</p>

<p>The name of hardiness and policy.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>CANTERBURY</b>
<p>That is why God divided humanity into various functions, so as to keep human endeavor moving ever forward, the one single fixed element—the aim—being obedience. Honey bees operate in just such a communal way. In fact, you can learn a lot about how to run a well-ordered kingdom from these creatures. They have a king and officers of sorts. Some, like magistrates, dole out punishment at home, while others venture forth for commerce, like merchants. Still others, armed like soldiers with stingers, pillage the summer flowers, bringing the booty triumphantly home to the royal tent of their emperor, who is preoccupied with governing. The emperor supervises the masons as they build gold roofs, the ordinary citizens as they process the honey, the humble laborers as they crowd through the city’s narrow gate with their heavy burdens, and the solemn-looking judge (with his grouchy hum) as he delivers lazy, unproductive drones to pale executioners. From this, I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end—just as many arrows, shot from different points, converge on a single target; just as many roads meet in a single town; just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea; just as the many radiuses of a sundial unite at its center. Just so, a thousand actions, once set in motion, will result in one desired object, and all will be well carried out and have a successful end. Therefore, head to France, my liege! Divide your lucky England into four. If you take even one quarter with you to France, you will nevertheless make the whole country shake. If we cannot defend our country with three times such a power left at home, then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation.</p>

<p>Now I’ve made up my mind, and with God’s help—and yours, you nobles who are the mainstay of my power—I’ll force France to fear me, or I’ll break her into pieces, as she’s rightfully mine. Either I’ll sit, ruling with absolute authority over France and all her dukedoms, or I’ll lay these bones in a common grave, with no stone or inscription over them. Either the story of my deeds will be declaimed loudly and without restraint, or else my grave will remain speechless, like a Turkish mute, not honored with even an epitaph etched in wax.</p>

<p>Thus, then, in few:</p>
<p>Your Highness, lately sending into France,</p>
<p>Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right</p>
<p>Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third;</p>
<p>In answer of which claim, the prince our master</p>
<p>Says that you savor too much of your youth</p>
<p>And bids you be advised there’s naught in France</p>
<p>That can be with a nimble galliard won.</p>
<p>You cannot revel into dukedoms there.</p>
<p>He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,</p>
<p>This tun of treasure, and, in lieu of this,</p>
<p>Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim</p>
<p>Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.</p>

<b>AMBASSADOR</b>
<p>Here it is then, in as few words as possible. Your Highness recently sent word to France claiming certain dukedoms as your own, in the name of your great ancestor, King Edward the Third. By way of answer, the prince our master says that you’re acting like the immature youth that you are. He warns you to take note: there’s nothing in France that you can win by dancing. You can’t party your way into dukedoms there. He therefore sends you this casket of treasure as a gift more suited to your character. And in return for this gift, he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms. This is the Dauphin’s message.</p>

<p>We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.</p>
<p>His present and your pains we thank you for.</p>
<p>When we have matched our rackets to these balls,</p>
<p>We will in France, by God’s grace, play a set</p>
<p>Shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard.</p>
<p>Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler</p>
<p>That all the courts of France will be disturbed</p>
<p>With chases. And we understand him well,</p>
<p>How he comes o’er us with our wilder days,</p>
<p>Not measuring what use we made of them.</p>
<p>We never valued this poor seat of England</p>
<p>And therefore, living hence, did give ourself</p>
<p>To barbarous license, as ’tis ever common</p>
<p>That men are merriest when they are from home.</p>
<p>But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,</p>
<p>Be like a king, and show my sail of greatness</p>
<p>When I do rouse me in my throne of France,</p>
<p>For that I have laid by my majesty</p>
<p>And plodded like a man for working days.</p>
<p>But I will rise there with so full a glory</p>
<p>That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,</p>
<p>Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.</p>
<p>And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his</p>
<p>Hath turned his balls to gun-stones, and his soul</p>
<p>Shall stand sore chargèd for the wasteful vengeance</p>
<p>That shall fly with them; for many a thousand widows</p>

<p>Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down,</p>

<p>That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin’s scorn.</p>

<p>Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,</p>
<p>To venge me as I may and to put forth</p>
<p>My rightful hand in a well-hallowed cause.</p>
<p>So get you hence in peace. And tell the Dauphin</p>
<p>His jest will savor but of shallow wit</p>
<p>When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.</p>

<b>KING HENRY</b>
<p>I’m happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor. Thank you for his present and your trouble. Once I’ve put my rackets to these balls, I’ll play a set in France, God willing, that will knock his father’s crown right out of the court. Tell him he’s got himself such a willing opponent that we’ll be chasing balls all over France. And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days. He doesn’t realize how useful they were to me. For a long time, I didn’t value this humble throne of England, and therefore lived at some remove and gave myself over to riotous living. Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they’re away from home. But tell the Dauphin I will retain the dignity of kingship and appear all the more royal and glorious on the throne of France. Precisely for this purpose I went about like a commoner and experienced the life of the ordinary man. Now I’ll rise there with such glory that I’ll dazzle all the eyes of France. I’ll shine so brightly that even the Dauphin will be struck blind. And tell the laughing prince that this joke of his has transformed his tennis balls into cannon balls, and the destructive vengeance they bring with them will be his responsibility. His mocking will mock many thousands of widows out of their husbands. It will mock mothers out of their sons, and mock castles down. There are people yet unborn and unconceived who will have reason to curse the Dauphin’s scorn. But all this lies with God, to whom I do appeal. In God’s name, inform the Dauphin I am coming, to avenge myself and to put forth my rightful hand in a sanctified cause. So go in peace. And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it. <em>(to attendants)</em> Give them safe conduct.—Farewell.</p>

<p>I hope to make the sender blush for it. Now, lords, don’t let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition. My thoughts are now bent entirely on France—except my thoughts about God, who takes precedence over this undertaking. Therefore, let’s set about mustering the requisite number of troops and give consideration to anything that can be expected to speed our enterprise. For, with God on our side, we’ll chastise this prince on his father’s own doorstep. Therefore, let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken.</p>
