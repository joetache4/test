<p>And they’ve been plotting things together. I’m not saying you’ll get a masquerade party, but if you do, I predicted it.

Don’t stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces. Block up my house’s ears—I mean the windows. Don’t let the noise of shallow fools enter my serious house. I swear, I’m in no mood to go out to dinner tonight, but I’ll go anyway.—Launcelot, go tell them I’ll come.</p>
