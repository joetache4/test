  - os: "Enter JULIET"
    ms: "JULIET enters."

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse."
      - "In half an hour she promised to return."
      - "Perchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so."
      - "Oh, she is lame! Love’s heralds should be thoughts,"
      - "Which ten times faster glide than the sun’s beams,"
      - "Driving back shadows over louring hills."
      - "Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw love"
      - "And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings."
      - "Now is the sun upon the highmost hill"
      - "Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve"
      - "Is three long hours, yet she is not come."
      - "Had she affections and warm youthful blood,"
      - "She would be as swift in motion as a ball."
      - "My words would bandy her to my sweet love,"
      - "And his to me."
      - "But old folks, many feign as they were dead,"
      - "Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead."
    m:
      - "I sent the Nurse at nine o’clock. Maybe she can’t find him. That can’t be. Oh, she’s slow! Love’s messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten times faster than sunbeams. They should be strong enough to push shadows over the dark hills. That’s the way doves carry Venus so fast, and that’s why Cupid has wings that let him fly as fast as the wind. Now it’s noon. That’s three hours since nine o’clock, but she hasn’t come back. If she was young and passionate, she’d move as fast as a ball. My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his words would bounce her back to me. But a lot of old people act like they’re already dead—sluggish, slow, fat, and colorless, like lead."

  - os: "Enter NURSE and PETER"
    ms: "The NURSE and PETER enter."

  - o:
      - "O God, she comes.—O honey Nurse, what news?"
      - "Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away."
    m:
      - "Oh my God, here she comes! Oh sweet Nurse, what news do you bring? Have you spoken to him? Send your man away."

  - sp: NURSE
    o:
      - "Peter, stay at the gate."
    m:
      - "Peter, wait for me at the gate."

  - os: "Exit PETER"
    ms: "PETER exits."

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "Now, good sweet Nurse— O Lord, why look’st thou sad?"
      - "Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily."
      - "If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news"
      - "By playing it to me with so sour a face."
    m:
      - "Now, good sweet Nurse—Oh Lord, why do you look so sad? Even if the news is sad, tell me with a smile on your face. If the news is good, you’re ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that."

  - sp: NURSE
    o:
      - "I am aweary. Give me leave awhile."
      - "Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I!"
    m:
      - "I am tired. Leave me alone for a minute. Oh my, my bones ache so much. I’ve been running all over the place."

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news."
      - "Nay, come, I pray thee, speak. Good, good Nurse, speak."
    m:
      - "I wish you had my bones, and I had your news. Come on now, I beg you, speak, good Nurse, speak."

  - sp: NURSE
    o:
      - "Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?"
      - "Do you not see that I am out of breath?"
    m:
      - "Sweet Jesus, you’re in such a hurry! Can’t you wait for a moment? Don’t you see that I’m out of breath?"

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath"
      - "To say to me that thou art out of breath?"
      - "The excuse that thou dost make in this delay"
      - "Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse."
      - "Is thy news good, or bad? Answer to that."
      - "Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance."
      - "Let me be satisfied. Is ’t good or bad?"
    m:
      - "How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you’re out of breath? The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself. Is the news good or bad? Answer that question. Tell me if it’s good or bad, and I’ll wait for the details. Tell me so I can be satisfied. Is it good or bad?"

  - sp: NURSE
    o:
      - "Well, you have made a simple choice. You know not how to choose a man. Romeo! No, not he, though his face be better than any man’s, yet his leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I’ll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench. Serve God. What, have you dined at home?"
    m:
      - "Well, you have made a foolish choice. You don’t know how to pick a man. Romeo? No, not him, though his face is more handsome than any man’s, and his legs are prettier, and as for his hands and feet and body, they’re not much to speak of, and yet they’re beyond compare. He’s not the most polite man in the world, but, believe me, he’s gentle as a lamb. Well, do what you want. Be good. Have you had lunch yet?"

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "No, no. But all this did I know before."
      - "What says he of our marriage? What of that?"
    m:
      - "No, I haven’t had lunch. Everything you told me I already knew. What does he say about our marriage? What about that?"

  - sp: NURSE
    o:
      - "Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!"
      - "It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces."
      - "My back a’ t’ other side. Ah, my back, my back!"
      - "Beshrew your heart for sending me about,"
      - "To catch my death with jaunting up and down!"
    m:
      - "Lord, what a headache I’ve got! My head is pounding. It feels like it’ll break into twenty pieces. My back aches too—*(JULIET rubs her back)* Ooh, on the other side—ah, my poor aching back! Curse your heart for sending me running all over town. I could get sick and die."

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "I’ faith, I am sorry that thou art not well."
      - "Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?"
    m:
      - "Believe me, I’m sorry you’re in pain. Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what did my love Romeo say?"

  - sp: NURSE
    o:
      - "Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous— Where is your mother?"
    m:
      - "Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, who is courteous, kind, handsome, and, I believe, virtuous— where is your mother?"

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "Where is my mother? Why, she is within."
      - "Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!"
      - "“Your love says, like an honest gentleman,"
      - "’Where is your mother?’”"
    m:
      - "Where is my mother? Why, she’s inside. Where else would she be? Your answer is so strange! “Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, ’Where is your mother?’”"

  - sp: NURSE
    o:
      - "    O God’s lady dear,"
      - "Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow."
      - "Is this the poultice for my aching bones?"
      - "Henceforward do your messages yourself."
    m:
      - "Oh holy Mary, mother of God! Are you this impatient? Come on, you’re being ridiculous! Is this the cure for my aching bones? From now on, take care of your messages yourself."

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "Here’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?"
    m:
      - "You’re making such a fuss. Come on, what did Romeo say?"

  - sp: NURSE
    o:
      - "Have you got leave to go to shrift today?"
    m:
      - "Do you have permission to go out and take confession today?"

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "I have."
    m:
      - "I do."

  - sp: NURSE
    o:
      - "Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’s cell."
      - "There stays a husband to make you a wife."
      - "Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks."
      - "They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news."
      - "Hie you to church. I must another way"
      - "To fetch a ladder, by the which your love"
      - "Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark."
      - "I am the drudge and toil in your delight,"
      - "But you shall bear the burden soon at night."
      - "Go. I’ll to dinner. Hie you to the cell."
    m:
      - "Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence’s cell. There’s a husband there who’s waiting to make you his wife. Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks. You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news. Go to the church. I must go by a different path to get a rope ladder. Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it’s dark. I do the drudge work for your pleasure. But soon you’ll be doing a wife’s work all night long. Go. I’ll go to lunch. You go to Friar Lawrence’s cell."

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "Hie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell."
    m:
      - "Wish me luck. Thank you, dear Nurse."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
