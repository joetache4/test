<p>I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards</p>

<p>Which has no need of you. Begone.</p>
<p>My treasure’s in the harbor. Take it. Oh,</p>

<p>My very hairs do mutiny, for the white</p>
<p>Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them</p>
<p>For fear and doting. Friends, begone. You shall</p>
<p>Have letters from me to some friends that will</p>
<p>Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,</p>
<p>Nor make replies of loathness. Take the hint</p>
<p>Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left</p>
<p>Which leaves itself. To the seaside straightway!</p>
<p>I will possess you of that ship and treasure.</p>
<p>Leave me, I pray, a little. Pray you now,</p>
<p>Nay, do so, for indeed I have lost command.</p>

<b>ANTONY</b>
<p>I have already fled from my true self. I’ve told cowards to turn their backs on me and run. Friends, go. I’ve decided on a plan that doesn’t require your assistance. Leave. My treasure’s in the harbor; take it. Oh, I followed something I’m ashamed to look at now! Even my hair revolts. The white hairs blame the brown hairs for being irresponsible, and the brown ones blame the white ones for being spineless and foolish. Friends, go. I’ll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you. Please, don’t be sad, and don’t tell me how reluctant you are. Take your cues from my own despair. Abandon the person that has abandoned himself. Go to the harbor immediately! I’ll give you the title to that ship and its treasure. Just give me a moment, please—only a moment. I’ve relinquished my authority, so please—I’ll see you all before long.</p>
