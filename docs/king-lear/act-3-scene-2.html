<p>Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow!</p>

<p>Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,</p>
<p>Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,</p>

<p>Blow, winds! Blow until your cheeks crack! Rage on, blow! Let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned. Let quick sulfurous lightning, strong enough to split enormous trees, singe the white hair on my head. Let thunder flatten the spherical world, crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings, and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow!</p>

<p>Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand, your slave—</p>
<p>A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.</p>

<b>LEAR</b>
<p>Let thunder rumble! Let lightning spit fire! Let the rain spray! The rain, the wind, the thunder and lightning are not my daughters. Nature, I don’t accuse your weather of unkindness. I never gave you a kingdom or raised you as my child, and you don’t owe me any obedience. So go ahead and have your terrifying fun. Here I am, your slave—a poor, sick, weak, hated old man. But I can still accuse you of kowtowing, taking my daughters’ side against me, ancient as I am. Oh, it’s foul!</p>

<p>So beggars marry many.</p>
<p>The man that makes his toe</p>
<p>What he his heart should make</p>

<p>Anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders.</p>
<p>The guy who finds a place to put his penis</p>

<p>Will wind up dirt poor and covered with lice</p>
<p>With a crowd of slut daughters to add to the slut wife.</p>
<p>The man who kicks away</p>

<p>Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies</p>
<p>Gallow the very wanderers of the dark</p>
<p>And make them keep their caves. Snce I was man,</p>
<p>Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,</p>

<p><em>(to LEAR)</em> Ah, sir, you’re here? Even creatures of the night aren’t out tonight in this storm. The angry skies terrify the animals that usually prowl in the dark, making them stay in their caves. Never in my life have I heard such horrible blasts of thunder, such a roaring downpour, such groaning winds. It’s too trying and terrifying for humans to bear.</p>

<p>Let the great gods</p>

<p>Unwhipped of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand,</p>
<p>Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue</p>
<p>That art incestuous. Caitiff, to pieces shake,</p>
<p>That under covert and convenient seeming</p>
<p>Hast practiced on man’s life. Close pent-up guilts,</p>

<p>Let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light. Any wretched person who has committed secret crimes and escaped justice should tremble in fear now. Better hide now, you murderers, you perjurers, you incest-practicing people who pretend to be virtuous. Tremble and shake, villain, for secretly plotting against human lives. Let all your bottled-up crimes come flooding out at last, as you beg for mercy from the gods who summon these terrifying winds and thunderbolts. Other people have sinned against me more than I have sinned against them.</p>

<p>Repose you there, while I to this hard house—</p>
<p>More harder than the stones whereof ’tis raised,</p>

<p>Why, you’re not even wearing a hat? My lord, there’s a hut nearby. It will give you some protection from this storm. Rest there while I go back to the unfriendly house where your sisters are staying, and ask them for help. They are harder than the stones the house is made of. Just now, when I asked them if they knew where you were, they wouldn’t let me in. But I’ll go back and force them to be polite.</p>

<p>This is a brave night to cool a courtesan.</p>

<b>FOOL</b>
<p>This would be a great night to satisfy a whore’s lust. I’ll recite a prophecy before I go.</p>
<p>One day, when priests don’t practice what they preach,</p>
<p>When brewers dilute their beer with water,</p>
<p>When noblemen teach their tailors how to sew,</p>
<p>When instead of heretics being burned at the stake, lovers are burned by syphilis,</p>
<p>When every law case is tried fairly,</p>
<p>When no gentleman is in debt,</p>
<p>When no one slanders anyone else,</p>
<p>And thieves don’t snatch wallets in crowds,</p>
<p>When moneylenders count their gold in the open air,</p>
<p>And pimps and whores build fine churches—</p>
<p>Then the kingdom of England</p>
<p>Will come to ruin.</p>
<p>And whoever lives to see that day</p>
<p>Will walk with his feet.</p>
<p>This is the prophecy that the wizard Merlin will make one day. I’m a little ahead of my time in saying it now.</p>
