<b>PAULINA</b>
<p>I swear that the king must give up these dangerous fits of madness—curse them! He must be told, and I’ll do it—it’s a task best suited to a woman. If I am deceitful, let my tongue blister and never be capable of expressing my anger ever again. Please, Emilia, tell the queen that I am her devoted supporter, and if she’ll trust me with the baby I’ll show her to the king and be her loudest advocate. Maybe he will soften up at the sight of the child. Pure silent innocence can sometimes convince when speech fails to do so.</p>

<p>Worthy madam, you are so obviously honorable and good that your generous mission cannot fail to have a positive outcome. There is no lady living more suitable for this great errand.
