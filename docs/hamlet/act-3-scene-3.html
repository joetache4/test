<b>ROSENCRANTZ</b>
<p>Everyone tries to avoid harm, but the public figure demands even more protection. When a great leader dies he doesn’t die alone but, like a whirlpool, draws others with him. He’s like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things—when it falls down the mountain, every little object goes down with it. Whenever a king sighs, everyone groans.</p>

<p>Oh, my offence is rank. It smells to heaven.</p>
<p>It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t,</p>
<p>A brother’s murder. Pray can I not.</p>
<p>Though inclination be as sharp as will,</p>
<p>My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,</p>
<p>And, like a man to double business bound,</p>
<p>I stand in pause where I shall first begin,</p>
<p>And both neglect. What if this cursèd hand</p>
<p>Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood?</p>
<p>Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens</p>
<p>To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy</p>
<p>But to confront the visage of offence?</p>
<p>And what’s in prayer but this twofold force,</p>
<p>To be forestallèd ere we come to fall</p>
<p>Or pardoned being down? Then I’ll look up.</p>
<p>My fault is past. But oh, what form of prayer</p>
<p>Can serve my turn, “Forgive me my foul murder”?</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<p>Oh, my crime is so rotten it stinks all the way to heaven. It has the mark of Cain on it, a brother’s murder. I can’t pray, though I want to desperately. My guilt is stronger even than my intentions. And like a person with two opposite things to do at once, I stand paralyzed and neglect them both. So what if this cursed hand of mine is coated with my brother’s blood? Isn’t there enough rain in heaven to wash it clean as snow? Isn’t that what God’s mercy is for? And doesn’t prayer serve these two purposes—to keep us from sinning and to bring us forgiveness when we have sinned? So I’ll pray. I’ve already committed my sin. But, oh, what kind of prayer is there for me? “Dear Lord, forgive me for my horrible murder”?</p>

<p>That cannot be, since I am still possessed</p>
<p>Of those effects for which I did the murder:</p>
<p>My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.</p>
<p>May one be pardoned and retain th’ offense?</p>
<p>In the corrupted currents of this world</p>
<p>Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice,</p>
<p>And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself</p>
<p>Buys out the law. But ’tis not so above.</p>
<p>There is no shuffling. There the action lies</p>
<p>In his true nature, and we ourselves compelled,</p>
<p>Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,</p>
<p>To give in evidence. What then? What rests?</p>
<p>Try what repentance can. What can it not?</p>
<p>Yet what can it when one can not repent?</p>
<p>O wretched state! O bosom black as death!</p>
<p>O limèd soul that, struggling to be free,</p>
<p>Art more engaged! Help, angels. Make assay.</p>
<p>Bow, stubborn knees, and, heart with strings of steel,</p>
<p>Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe.</p>
<p>All may be well. <em>(kneels)</em></p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<p>That won’t work, since I’m still reaping the rewards of that murder: my crown and my queen. Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime? In this wicked world, criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law, shoving justice aside. But not in heaven. Up there, every action is judged for exactly what it’s worth, and we’re forced to confront our crimes. So what can I do? What is there left to do? Offer whatever repentance I can—that couldn’t hurt. But it can’t help either! Oh, what a lousy situation I’m in. My heart’s as black as death. My soul is stuck to sin, and the more it struggles to break free, the more it sticks. Help me, angels! C’mon, make an effort. Bend, stubborn knees. Steely heart, be soft as a newborn babe, so I can pray. Perhaps everything will turn out okay after all. <em>(he kneels)</em></p>

<b>HAMLET</b>
<p>I could do it easily now. He’s praying now. And now I’ll do it. <em>(he draws out his sword)</em> And there he goes, off to heaven. And that’s my revenge. I’d better think about this more carefully. A villain kills my father, and I, my father’s only son, send this same villain to heaven. Seems like I just did him a favor. He killed my father when my father was enjoying life, with all his sins in full bloom, before my father could repent for any of them. Only God knows how many sins my father has to pay for. As for me, I don’t think his prospects look so good. So is it really revenge for me if I kill Claudius right when he is confessing his sins, in perfect condition for a trip to heaven? No. Away, sword, and wait for a better moment to kill him. <em>(he puts his sword away)</em> When he’s sleeping off some drunken orgy, or having incestuous sex, or swearing while he gambles, or committing some other act that has no goodness about it—that’s when I’ll trip him up and send him to hell with his heels kicking up at heaven. My mother’s waiting. The king’s trying to cure himself with prayer, but all he’s doing is keeping himself alive a little longer.</p>
