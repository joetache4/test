      - "desire they were, but, in faith, honest as the skin between"
      - "his brows."
    m:

      - "Neighbors, you are tedious."
    m:
      - "Friends, you are becoming tedious."

  - sp: DOGBERRY
    o:
      - "It pleases your Worship to say so, but we are the poor duke’s"
      - "officers. But truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as"
      - "a king, I could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your"
      - "worship."
    m:
      - "Thank you for saying that, your Worship, but we’re just the poor duke’s officers. But truly, if I were as tedious as a king, I would give everything to you, your Worship."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "All thy tediousness on me, ah?"
    m:

  - sp: DOGBERRY

      - "Yea, an ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis, for I hear"
      - "as good exclamation on your Worship as of any man in the"
      - "city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it."
    m:
      - "Yes, even if I had a thousand more pounds than that, for I hear that you are exclaimed throughout the city, and though I am only a poor man, it makes me glad to hear it."

  - sp: VERGES
    o:
      - "And so am I."
    m:
      - "Me, too."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "I would fain know what you have to say."
    m:

  - sp: VERGES
    o:
      - "Marry, sir, our watch tonight, excepting your Worship’s"
      - "presence, ha’ ta’en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in"
      - "Messina."
    m:
      - "Sir, our watch tonight—expectfully, sir—has captured a couple of the worst criminals in Messina."

  - sp: DOGBERRY
    o:
      - "A good old man, sir. He will be talking. As they say, “When"
      - "the age is in, the wit is out.” God help us, it is a world to see!"
      - "Well said, i’ faith, neighbor Verges.—Well, God’s a good"
      - "man. An two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An"
      - "honest soul, i’ faith, sir, by my troth he is, as ever broke"
      - "bread, but God is to be worshipped, all men are not alike,"
      - "alas, good neighbor!"
    m:
      - "*(to LEONATO)* Verges is a good old man, sir, but he’s always babbling. Like they say, “When age comes, wit goes.” God help us, what a world! *(to VERGES)* You did well, Verges, honestly. *(to LEONATO)* Well, God’s a fair man. If two men are riding on one horse, one must naturally ride behind. Verges is as honest a man as any, but, God bless him, not all men are created equal. Am I right, my friend?"

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "Indeed, neighbor, he comes too short of you."
    m:
      - "Truly, my friend, he isn’t nearly as impressive as you are."

  - sp: DOGBERRY
    o:
      - "Gifts that God gives."
    m:
      - "God gives those gifts—I had nothing to do with it."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "I must leave you."

      - "morning examined before your worship."
    m:
      - "One more thing, sir. Our watch, sir, as you know, has comprehended two auspicious persons. We’d like for you to examine them this morning."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "Take their examination yourself and bring it me. I am now"
      - "in great haste, as it may appear unto you."
    m:
      - "Examine them yourselves, then bring me your findings. Now I’m in a great hurry, as I’m sure you can see."

  - sp: DOGBERRY
    o:
      - "It shall be suffigance."
    m:
      - "That will be suffigance."

  - sp: LEONATO

    m:
      - "We must do this wisely."

  - sp: DOGBERRY
    o:
      - "We will spare for no wit, I warrant you. Here’s that shall"
      - "drive some of them to a noncome. Only get the learned"
