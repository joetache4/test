<p>Not a whit. I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed.

<b>BOTTOM</b>
<p>Not at all! I’ve got a plan that will fix everything. Write me a prologue that I can recite to the audience before the play starts. I’ll tell them that we won’t hurt anyone with our swords, and that Pyramus isn’t really dead. And to make it even clearer, we can tell them that I’m playing Pyramus but I’m not really Pyramus—really, I’m Bottom the weaver. That’ll keep them from being afraid.</p>

<p>No, we can just announce the actor’s name, and let his face show through the lion costume, and have him say something himself.

I value your lives as highly as my own. If you thought I was a real lion, I would be risking my life. But no, I am not at all a lion.

<p>Ay. Or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber. For Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall.</p>

<p>Yes, or else someone will have to come in carrying a bundle of sticks and a lantern and say he’s come to disfigure, or represent, the character of Moonshine, because the man in the moon is supposed to carry sticks and a lantern.

<b>TITANIA</b>
<p>Don’t bother wishing you could leave this forest, because you’re going to stay here whether you want to or not. I’m no ordinary fairy. I rule over the summer, and I love you. So come with me. I’ll give you fairies as servants, and they’ll bring you jewels from the depths of the ocean, and sing to you while you sleep on a bed of flowers. And I’ll turn you into a spirit like us, so you won’t die as humans do.—Come here, Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed!</p>

<p>Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.</p>
<p>Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes.</p>
<p>Feed him with apricoks and dewberries,</p>
<p>With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.</p>
<p>The honey bags steal from the humble-bees,</p>
<p>And for night tapers crop their waxen thighs</p>
<p>And light them at the fiery glowworms’ eyes</p>
<p>To have my love to bed and to arise.</p>
<p>And pluck the wings from painted butterflies</p>
<p>To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.</p>
<p>Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.</p>

<b>TITANIA</b>
<p>Be kind and polite to this gentleman. Follow him around. Leap and dance for him. Feed him apricots and blackberries, with purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries. Steal honey from the bumblebees, and make candles out of the bees’ wax. Light them with the light of glowworms, so my love will have light when he goes to bed and wakes up. Pluck off colorful butterfly wings, and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps. Bow to him, fairies, and curtsy to him.</p>

<p>Good Mr. Mustardseed, I know you very well. Those cowardly, gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef.

<p>Come, wait upon him. Lead him to my bower.</p>
<p>The moon methinks looks with a watery eye.</p>
<p>And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,</p>
<p>Lamenting some enforcèd chastity.</p>
<p>Tie up my love’s tongue. Bring him silently.</p>
</td>

<p>Take good care of him. Take him to my sleeping area. The moon looks sad to me. When she cries, all the little flowers cry too. They’re sad because someone is prevented from having sex—or is having it against her will. Keep my lover quiet. Bring him to me in silence.</p>
