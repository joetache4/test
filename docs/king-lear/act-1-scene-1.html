The two great princes of France and Burgundy, vying for the hand of my youngest Cordelia, have been at my court a long time and will soon have their answers.—My daughters, since I’m about to give up my throne and the worries that go along with it, tell me which one of you loves me most, so that I can give my largest gift to the one who deserves it most.—Goneril, my oldest daughter, you speak first.</p>

<p>Hear me, recreant! On thine allegiance hear me.</p>
<p>That thou hast sought to make us break our vows,</p>
<p>Which we durst never yet, and with strained pride</p>
<p>To come betwixt our sentence and our power,</p>
<p>Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,</p>
<p>Our potency made good, take thy reward:</p>
<p>Five days we do allot thee for provision</p>
<p>To shield thee from diseases of the world.</p>
<p>And on the sixth to turn thy hated back</p>
<p>Upon our kingdom. If on the next day following</p>
<p>Thy banished trunk be found in our dominions,</p>
<p>The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,</p>
<p>This shall not be revoked.</p>

<b>LEAR</b>
<p>Listen to me, you traitor. You’ll pay the price for trying to make me go back on the vow I made when I bequeathed my kingdom to them. I’ve never broken a vow yet. You tried to make me revise my judgment on my youngest daughter, disrespecting my power as king—which I can’t put up with either as a ruler or as a person. This is your punishment: I’ll give you five days to gather together what you need to survive, then on the sixth day you’ll leave this kingdom that hates you. If the day after that you’re found in my kingdom, you die. Now get out of here! I swear by Jupiter I’ll never revoke this punishment.</p>
