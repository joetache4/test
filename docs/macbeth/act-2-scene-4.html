<p>Ha, good father,</p>
<p>Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man’s act,</p>
<p>Threatens his bloody stage. By th’ clock ’tis day,</p>
<p>And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.</p>
<p>Is ’t night’s predominance or the day’s shame</p>
<p>That darkness does the face of Earth entomb</p>
<p>When living light should kiss it?</p>
</td>

<b>ROSS</b>
<p>Ah yes, old man. You can see the skies. They look like they’re upset about what mankind has been doing, and they’re threatening the Earth with storms. The clock says it’s daytime, but dark night is strangling the sun. Is it because night is so strong, or because day is so weak, that darkness covers the earth when it’s supposed to be light?</p>

<p>And something else strange happened. Duncan’s horses, which are beautiful and swift and the best of their breed, suddenly turned wild and broke out of their stalls. Refusing to be obedient as usual, they acted like they were at war with mankind.</p>
