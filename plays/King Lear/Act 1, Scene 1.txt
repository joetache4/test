  - os: "Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND"
    ms: "KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND enter."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall."
    m:
      - "I thought the king preferred the Duke of Albany to the Duke of Cornwall."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "It did always seem so to us. But now in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values most, for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moiety."
    m:
      - "We used to think so too. But the way he’s divided the kingdom recently, nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more. He’s split the kingdom so evenly that it’s impossible to see any indication of favoritism."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "*(indicating EDMUND)* Is not this your son, my lord?"
    m:
      - "*(pointing to EDMUND)* Isn’t this your son, my lord?"

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am brazed to it."
    m:
      - "Yes, I’ve been responsible for his upbringing. I’ve had to acknowledge that he’s my son so many times that now I can do it without embarrassment."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "I cannot conceive you."
    m:
      - "I can’t conceive of what you mean."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "Sir, this young fellow’s mother could, whereupon she grew round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?"
    m:
      - "You can’t conceive? Well, this guy’s mother could conceive him all to well. She grew a big belly and had a baby for her crib before she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell something naughty?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper."
    m:
      - "Well, I wouldn’t want to undo the naughtiness, since the boy turned out so well."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year older than this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave came something saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged.—Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?"
    m:
      - "But I have a legitimate son a few years older than this one, and I don’t love him any more than I love my bastard. Edmund may have snuck into the world a little before his time, but his mother was pretty, we had a fun time making him, and now I have to acknowledge the guy as my son.—Do you know this gentleman, Edmund?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "No, my lord."
    m:
      - "No, I don’t, my lord."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "*(to EDMUND)* My lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honorable friend."
    m:
      - "*(to EDMUND)* This is Lord Kent. Remember him as my friend and an honorable man."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "My services to your lordship."
    m:
      - "Very pleased to meet you, my lord."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "I must love you and sue to know you better."
    m:
      - "I look forward to getting to know you better."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "Sir, I shall study deserving."
    m:
      - "I’ll try to make myself worth your knowledge."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again."
    m:
      - "He’s been gone for nine years and he’s leaving again soon."

    ms: "A man bearing a crown enters, followed by KING LEAR, the Dukes of CORNWALL and ALBANY, then GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and attendants."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester."
    m:
      - "Go escort the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "I shall, my lord."
    m:
      - "Yes, my lord."

  - os: "Exit GLOUCESTERLEAR"
    ms: "GLOUCESTER exits."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.—"
      - "Give me the map there.—Know that we have divided"
      - "In three our kingdom, and ’tis our fast intent"
      - "To shake all cares and business from our age,"
      - "Conferring them on younger strengths while we"
      - "Unburdened crawl toward death.—Our son of Cornwall,"
      - "And you, our no less loving son of Albany,"
      - "We have this hour a constant will to publish"
      - "Our daughters’ several dowers, that future strife"
      - "May be prevented now."
      - "The two great princes, France and Burgundy,"
      - "Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,"
      - "Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,"
      - "And here are to be answered.—Tell me, my daughters,"
      - "(Since now we will divest us both of rule,"
      - "Interest of territory, cares of state)"
      - "Which of you shall we say doth love us most"
      - "That we our largest bounty may extend"
      - "Where nature doth with merit challenge?—Goneril,"
      - "Our eldest born, speak first."
    m:
      - "In the meantime I’ll get down to my real business.—Hand me that map over there.—I hereby announce that I’ve divided my kingdom into three parts, which I’m handing over to the younger generation so I can enjoy a little rest and peace of mind in my old age.—Cornwall and Albany, my loving sons-in-law, I now want to announce publicly what each of my daughters will inherit, to avoid hostilities after I die. The two great princes of France and Burgundy, vying for the hand of my youngest Cordelia, have been at my court a long time and will soon have their answers.—My daughters, since I’m about to give up my throne and the worries that go along with it, tell me which one of you loves me most, so that I can give my largest gift to the one who deserves it most.—Goneril, my oldest daughter, you speak first."

  - sp: GONERIL
    o:
      - "Sir, I do love you more than words can wield the matter,"
      - "Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty,"
      - "Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,"
      - "No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honor,"
      - "As much as child e’er loved or father found—"
      - "A love that makes breath poor and speech unable."
      - "Beyond all manner of so much I love you."
    m:
      - "Sir, I love you more than words can say. I love you more than eyesight, space, and freedom, beyond wealth or anything of value. I love you as much as life itself, and as much as status, health, beauty, or honor. I love you as much as any child has ever loved her father, with a love too deep to be spoken of. I love you more than any answer to the question “How much?”"

  - sp: CORDELIA
    o:
      - "*(aside)* What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent."
    m:
      - "*(to herself)* What will I say? I can only love and be silent."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,"
      - "With shadowy forests and with champains riched,"
      - "With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,"
      - "We make thee lady. To thine and Albany’s issue"
      - "Be this perpetual.—What says our second daughter,"
      - "Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak."
    m:
      - "I give you all this land, from this line to that one—dense forests, fertile fields, rivers rich with fish, wide meadows. This land will belong to your and Albany’s children forever.—And now what does my second daughter Regan, the wife of Cornwall, have to say? Tell me."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "Sir, I am made of that self mettle as my sister,"
      - "And prize me at her worth. In my true heart,"
      - "I find she names my very deed of love—"
      - "Only she comes too short, that I profess"
      - "Myself an enemy to all other joys,"
      - "Which the most precious square of sense possesses."
      - "And find I am alone felicitate"
      - "In your dear highness’ love."
    m:
      - "Sir, I’m made of the same stuff as my sister and consider myself just as good as she is. She’s described my feelings of love for you precisely, but her description falls a little short of the truth. I reject completely any joy except my love for you, and I find that only your majesty’s love makes me happy."

  - sp: CORDELIA
    o:
      - "*(aside)*     Then poor Cordelia!"
      - "And yet not so, since I am sure my love’s"
      - "More ponderous than my tongue."
    m:
      - "*(to herself)* Poor me, what am I going to say now? But I’m not poor in love—my love is bigger than my words are."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "To thee and thine hereditary ever"
      - "Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,"
      - "No less in space, validity, and pleasure"
      - "Than that conferred on Goneril.—But now, our joy,"
      - "Although our last and least, to whose young love"
      - "The vines of France and milk of Burgundy"
      - "Strive to be interessed. What can you say to draw"
      - "A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak."
    m:
      - "You and your heirs hereby receive this large third of our lovely kingdom, no smaller in area or value than what I gave Goneril.—Now, you, my youngest daughter, my joy, courted by the rich rulers of France and Burgundy, what can you tell me that will make me give you a bigger part of my kingdom than I gave your sisters? Speak."

  - sp: CORDELIA
    o:
      - "Nothing, my lord."
    m:
      - "Nothing, my lord."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Nothing?"
    m:
      - "Nothing?"

  - sp: CORDELIA
    o:
      - "Nothing."
    m:
      - "Nothing."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "How? Nothing will come of nothing. Speak again."
    m:
      - "Come on, “nothing” will get you nothing. Try again."

  - sp: CORDELIA
    o:
      - "Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave"
      - "My heart into my mouth. I love your majesty"
      - "According to my bond, no more nor less."
    m:
      - "I’m unlucky. I don’t have a talent for putting my heart’s feelings into words. I love you as a child should love her father, neither more nor less."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,"
      - "Lest you may mar your fortunes."
    m:
      - "What are you saying, Cordelia? Revise your statement, or you may damage your inheritance."

  - sp: CORDELIA
    o:
      - "    Good my lord,"
      - "You have begot me, bred me, loved me. I"
      - "Return those duties back as are right fit—"
      - "Obey you, love you, and most honor you."
      - "Why have my sisters husbands if they say"
      - "They love you all? Haply when I shall wed"
      - "That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry"
      - "Half my love with him, half my care and duty."
      - "Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,"
      - "To love my father all."
    m:
      - "My lord, you brought me up and loved me, and I’m giving back just as I should: I obey you, love you, and honor you. How can my sisters speak the truth when they say they love only you? Don’t they love their husbands too? Hopefully when I get married, I’ll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty. I’m sure I’ll never get married in the way my sisters say they’re married, loving their father only."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "But goes thy heart with this?"
    m:
      - "But do you mean what you’re saying?"

  - sp: CORDELIA
    o:
      - "Ay, good my lord."
    m:
      - "Yes, my lord."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "So young and so untender?"
    m:
      - "So young and so cruel?"

  - sp: CORDELIA
    o:
      - "So young, my lord, and true."
    m:
      - "So young, my lord, and honest."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Let it be so. Thy truth then be thy dower."
      - "For by the sacred radiance of the sun,"
      - "The mysteries of Hecate and the night,"
      - "By all the operation of the orbs"
      - "From whom we do exist and cease to be—"
      - "Here I disclaim all my paternal care,"
      - "Propinquity, and property of blood,"
      - "And as a stranger to my heart and me"
      - "Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,"
      - "Or he that makes his generation messes"
      - "To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom"
      - "Be as well neighbored, pitied, and relieved"
      - "As thou my sometime daughter."
    m:
      - "Then that’s the way it’ll be. The truth will be all the inheritance you get. I swear by the sacred sun, by the mysterious moon, and by all the planets that rule our lives, that I disown you now as my daughter. As of now, there are no family ties between us, and I consider you a stranger to me. Foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you, ex-daughter of mine."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "    Good my liege—"
    m:
      - "But sir—"

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Peace, Kent."
      - "Come not between the dragon and his wrath."
      - "I loved her most and thought to set my rest"
      - "On her kind nursery.—"
      - "*(to CORDELIA)*"
      - "    Hence, and avoid my sight!—"
      - "So be my grave my peace as here I give"
      - "Her father’s heart from her.—Call France. Who stirs?"
      - "Call Burgundy.—"
    m:
      - "Be quiet, Kent. Don’t get in my way when I’m angry. I loved Cordelia most of all and planned to spend my old age with her taking care of me. *(to CORDELIA)* Go away! Get out of my sight!—I guess if she doesn’t love her father, then I’ll only have peace when I’m dead.—Call the King of France. Why is nobody doing anything? Call the Duke of Burgundy."

  - os: "Exeunt several attendants"
    ms: "Several attendants exit."

  - o:
      - "  Cornwall and Albany,"
      - "With my two daughters’ dowers digest this third."
      - "Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her."
      - "I do invest you jointly with my power,"
      - "Preeminence, and all the large effects"
      - "That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,"
      - "With reservation of an hundred knights"
      - "By you to be sustained, shall our abode"
      - "Make with you by due turns. Only shall we retain"
      - "The name, and all th’ additions to a king."
      - "The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,"
      - "Belovèd sons, be yours; which to confirm,"
      - "This coronet part between you."
      - "*(gives CORNWALL and ALBANY the coronet)*"
    m:
      - "Cornwall and Albany, you and your wives can divide this last third of my kingdom between you. If she wants to be proud, or “honest,” as she calls it, she can just marry her own pride. I hereby grant to you two my crown and all the privileges that kingship brings. I’ll live one month with one of you, the next month with the other one. All I ask is that you provide me with a hundred knights for my own entourage. I’ll keep only the title of king, but you’ll have everything else: all the authority and income that come with kingship. To confirm all this, take this crown to share between yourselves. *(he gives CORNWALL and ALBANY the crown)*"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "    Royal Lear,"
      - "Whom I have ever honored as my king,"
      - "Loved as my father, as my master followed,"
      - "As my great patron thought on in my prayers—"
    m:
      - "King Lear, I’ve always honored you as king, loved you as my father, obeyed you as my master, and thanked you in my prayers—"

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "The bow is bent and drawn. Make from the shaft."
    m:
      - "I’m furious and ready to snap. Stay away or else I’ll take my anger out on you."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Let it fall rather, though the fork invade"
      - "The region of my heart. Be Kent unmannerly"
      - "When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?"
      - "Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak"
      - "When power to flattery bows? To plainness honor’s bound"
      - "When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state,"
      - "And in thy best consideration check"
      - "This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,"
      - "Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,"
      - "Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound"
      - "Reverbs no hollowness."
    m:
      - "Let your anger fall on me then, even if its sharpness pierces my heart. Kent can speak rudely when Lear goes mad. What are you doing, old man? When powerful kings cave in to flatterers, do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it? When a majestic king starts acting silly, then it’s my duty to be blunt. Hold on to your crown and use your better judgment to rethink this rash decision. On my life I swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn’t love you least. A loud mouth often points to an empty heart, and just because she’s quiet doesn’t mean she’s unloving."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "  Kent, on thy life, no more."
    m:
      - "Kent, if you want to stay alive, stop talking."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "My life I never held but as a pawn"
      - "To wage against thy enemies, nor fear to lose it,"
      - "Thy safety being motive."
    m:
      - "I never considered my life as anything more than a chess pawn for you to play off against your enemies. I’m not afraid to lose it if it helps protect you."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "  Out of my sight!"
    m:
      - "Get out of my sight!"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "See better, Lear, and let me still remain"
      - "The true blank of thine eye."
    m:
      - "Learn to see better, Lear, and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "  Now, by Apollo—"
    m:
      - "Now, I swear by Apollo—"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Now, by Apollo, King,"
      - "Thou swear’st thy gods in vain."
    m:
      - "By Apollo, King, you’re taking the names of the gods in vain."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "O vassal! Miscreant!"
    m:
      - "Oh, you lowlife! Scum!"

  - sp: ALBANY, CORNWALL
    o:
      - "  Dear sir, forbear!"
    m:
      - "Please stop, sir."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Do, kill thy physician, and the fee bestow"
      - "Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy gift,"
      - "Or whilst I can vent clamor from my throat,"
      - "I’ll tell thee thou dost evil."
    m:
      - "Sure, kill the doctor who’s trying to cure you and pay your disease. Take back your gift to Albany and Cornwall. If you don’t, then as long as I’m able to speak I’ll keep telling you you’ve done a bad, bad thing."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Hear me, recreant! On thine allegiance hear me."
      - "That thou hast sought to make us break our vows,"
      - "Which we durst never yet, and with strained pride"
      - "To come betwixt our sentence and our power,"
      - "Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,"
      - "Our potency made good, take thy reward:"
      - "Five days we do allot thee for provision"
      - "To shield thee from diseases of the world."
      - "And on the sixth to turn thy hated back"
      - "Upon our kingdom. If on the next day following"
      - "Thy banished trunk be found in our dominions,"
      - "The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,"
      - "This shall not be revoked."
    m:
      - "Listen to me, you traitor. You’ll pay the price for trying to make me go back on the vow I made when I bequeathed my kingdom to them. I’ve never broken a vow yet. You tried to make me revise my judgment on my youngest daughter, disrespecting my power as king—which I can’t put up with either as a ruler or as a person. This is your punishment: I’ll give you five days to gather together what you need to survive, then on the sixth day you’ll leave this kingdom that hates you. If the day after that you’re found in my kingdom, you die. Now get out of here! I swear by Jupiter I’ll never revoke this punishment."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Why, fare thee well, King. Sith thus thou wilt appear,"
      - "Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here."
      - "*(to CORDELIA)*"
      - "The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,"
      - "That justly think’st and hast most rightly said!"
      - "*(to REGAN and GONERIL)*"
      - "And your large speeches may your deeds approve,"
      - "That good effects may spring from words of love.—"
      - "Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu."
      - "He’ll shape his old course in a country new."
    m:
      - "Farewell, King. If this is how you act, it’s clear that freedom has been banished from this kingdom.*(to CORDELIA)* I hope the gods will protect you, my dear girl, for thinking fairly and speaking correctly. *(to REGAN and GONERIL)* And you two, I hope your actions carry out your grand promises of love, so that big words can bring big results. Farewell to all of you. I’ll carry on my old life in a new land."

      - "Will you require in present dower with her"
      - "Or cease your quest of love?"
    m:
      - "My lord the ruler of Burgundy, I’ll speak to you first. You’ve been competing with this king for my daughter. What’s the least that you will settle for as a dowry?"

  - sp: BURGUNDY
    o:
      - "    Most royal majesty,"
      - "I crave no more than hath your highness offered."

    m:

I swear to God she’s not worth anything more than what I told you. *(to FRANCE)* And as for you, great King of France, I’d never insult our friendship by encouraging you to marry a girl I hate. So I beg you to look around for a better match than this wretched creature that you can barely call human."

It’s strange that someone so dear to you could do anything so horrible as to warrant this sudden hatred. Her crime must be extreme and monstrous, or else your earlier love for her wasn’t as true as it seemed. But it’d take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible."

So I beg your majesty to let people know that it wasn’t because I did something atrocious that I fell from your favor. I didn’t murder or commit any immoral or lustful act. I’m out of favor simply because I’m not a fortune-hunter and I don’t have a smooth way with words—and I’m a better person because of it, even though it has cost me your love."

I’ll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now, if it’s okay that I’m picking up what others have thrown away. It’s so strange that in neglecting you so cruelly, the gods have made me love you so dearly.—King, the daughter you’ve rejected is now mine, as Queen of France. No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now.—Say goodbye to them, Cordelia, even though they’ve been unkind to you. You’ll find a much better place in France than what you’re giving up here."

    m:
