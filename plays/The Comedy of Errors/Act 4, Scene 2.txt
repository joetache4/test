  - os: "Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA"
    ms: "ADRIANA and LUCIANA enter."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?"
      - "Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye"
      - "That he did plead in earnest, yea or no?"
      - "Looked he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?"
      - "What observation mad’st thou in this case"
      - "Of his heart’s meteors tilting in his face?"
    m:
      - "Oh, Luciana, did he tempt you like that? Could you tell from his face if he was serious? Yes or no? Did he look flushed or pale? Sad or happy? Could you tell from his looks what he was feeling in his heart?"

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "First he denied you had in him no right."
    m:
      - "First, he said you had no right to him."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "He meant he did me none; the more my spite."
    m:
      - "He meant he did nothing right for me—which is true, unfortunately."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Then swore he that he was a stranger here."
    m:
      - "Then he swore he was a stranger here."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were."
    m:
      - "And that’s true—he *is* being strange. And yet he lies as well, for he’s no stranger."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Then pleaded I for you."
    m:
      - "Then I pleaded for you."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "  And what said he?"
    m:
      - "And what did he say?"

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "That love i begged for you he begged of me."
    m:
      - "That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?"
    m:
      - "How did he try to persuade you to love him?"

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "With words that in an honest suit might move."
      - "First he did praise my beauty, then my speech."
    m:
      - "With words that—if they were spoken honestly—might have moved me. First, he praised my beauty, then my eloquence."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Did’st speak him fair?"
    m:
      - "Did you praise him as well?"

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "  Have patience, I beseech."
    m:
      - "Have some patience, please."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "I cannot, nor I will not hold me still;"
      - "My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will."
      - "He is deformèd, crooked, old, and sere,"
      - "Ill-faced, worse-bodied, shapeless everywhere,"
      - "Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind,"
      - "Stigmatical in making, worse in mind."
    m:
      - "I cannot and I will not keep quiet. My voice will have its way, even if my heart can’t. He is misshapen, crooked, old, and withered. His face is ugly, and his body is even worse—all shapeless, everywhere. He is vicious, mean, foolish, blunt, unkind. His body is deformed, and his mind is worse."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Who would be jealous, then, of such a one?"
      - "No evil lost is wailed when it is gone."
    m:
      - "Then why be jealous of a person like that? When an evil thing has been lost, no one cries."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Ah, but I think him better than I say,"
      - "And yet would herein others’ eyes were worse."
      - "Far from her nest the lapwing cries away."
      - "My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse."
    m:
      - "Oh, but I think of him more highly than I say I do—and I wish he looked worse in other women’s eyes. I’m like a lapwing, creating a diversion in order to distract predators from my nest. My heart adores him, even though my tongue curses him."

  - os: "Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, running"
    ms: "DROMIO OF SYRACUSE enters, running."

  - sp: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "Here, go—the desk, the purse! Sweet, now make haste."
    m:
      - "Here! Go! The desk! Money! Come on, now! Hurry!"

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "How hast thou lost thy breath?"
    m:
      - "How did you lose your breath?"

  - sp: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "  By running fast."
    m:
      - "By running fast."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?"
    m:
      - "Where’s your master, Dromio? Is he all right?"

  - sp: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell."
      - "A devil in an everlasting garment hath him,"
      - "One whose hard heart is buttoned up with steel;"
      - "A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;"
      - "A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;"
      - "A back-friend, a shoulder clapper, one that countermands"
      - "The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;"
      - "A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well,"
      - "One that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell."
    m:
      - "No, he’s in a place worse than hell. A devil in a tough uniform has him—a man whose heart is as hard as steel. A fiend and a goblin, pitiless and rough. A wolf—no, even worse—a man all in tough leather. A backbiting friend, one who grabs people, who patrols the streets and passageways. A hunting dog that runs in the opposite direction of its prey, yet can follow the scent of the hunt. A man who puts people away before the verdict is announced."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Why, man, what is the matter?"
    m:
      - "Speak, man, what’s the matter?"

  - sp: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "I do not know the matter. He is ’rested on the case."
    m:
      - "I don’t know what the matter is, but he’s been arrested for it."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit."
    m:
      - "What? He’s been arrested? Tell me, who had him arrested?"

  - sp: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "I know not at whose suit he is arrested well,"
      - "But he’s in a suit of buff which ’rested him; that can I tell."
      - "Will you send him, mistress, redemption—the money in his"
      - "  desk?"
    m:
      - "I don’t know who had him arrested, but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather. Mistress, will you send him bail? The money in the desk?"

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Go fetch it, sister."
    m:
      - "Get it, sister."

  - os: "Exit LUCIANA"
    ms: "LUCIANA exits."

  - o:
      - "  This I wonder at,"
      - "That he, unknown to me, should be in debt."
      - "Tell me, was he arrested on a band?"
    m:
      - "I don’t understand it. How could he be in debt without me knowing it? Tell me, was he arrested because of a band ?"

  - sp: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "Not on a band, but on a stronger thing:"
      - "A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?"
    m:
      - "Not for a band, but for something stronger: a necklace, a necklace! Don’t you hear it ring?"

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "What, the chain?"
    m:
      - "What, the necklace?"

  - sp: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "  No, no, the bell. ’Tis time that I were gone."
      - "It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one."
    m:
      - "No, no, the bell. It’s time for me to go. It was two o’clock when I left him, and now it’s one."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "The hours come back. That did I never hear."
    m:
      - "Time’s running backward? I’ve never heard of that."

  - sp: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "O yes, if any hour meet a sergeant, he turns back for"
      - "  very fear."
    m:
      - "Oh, sure. When an hour meets a cop, it turns and runs in fear."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "As if time were in debt. How fondly dost thou reason!"
    m:
      - "Time’s not the one in debt. Your logic is so foolish."

  - sp: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
    o:
      - "Time is a very bankrout and owes more than he’s worth to"
      - "  season."
      - "Nay, he’s a thief too. Have you not heard men say"
      - "That time comes stealing on by night and day?"
      - "If he be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,"
      - "Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?"
    m:
      - "Time is always bankrupt: it owes more than it can ever pay back in a season. And Time’s a thief, too—don’t you know the old saying, “Time steals along”? So if Time is in debt and also a thief, and a cop comes, don’t you think Time would turn back an hour?"

  - os: "Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse"
    ms: "LUCIANA returns with a purse full of money."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Go, Dromio. There’s the money. Bear it straight,"
      - "And bring thy master home immediately."
      - "Come, sister, I am pressed down with conceit:"
      - "Conceit, my comfort and my injury."
    m:
      - "Here’s the money, Dromio. Take it to your master and bring him home immediately. Come, sister, my imagination is too much for me: it both comforts me and depresses me."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
