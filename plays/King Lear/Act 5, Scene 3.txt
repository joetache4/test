  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "Some officers take them away. Good guard"
      - "Until their greater pleasures first be known"
      - "That are to censure them."
    m:
      - "Officers, take them away. Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them."

  - sp: CORDELIA
    o:
      - "*(to LEAR)*"
      - "  We are not the first"
      - "Who with best meaning have incurred the worst."
      - "For thee, oppressèd King, I am cast down."
      - "Myself could else outfrown false fortune’s frown."
      - "Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?"
    m:
      - "*(to LEAR)* At least we’re not the first ones in our position. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. But I’m worried about you, my poor King. If it were only me, I would just wait out my bad luck. Should we meet with my sisters?"

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "No, no, no, no! Come, let’s away to prison."
      - "We two alone will sing like birds i’ th’ cage."
      - "When thou dost ask me blessing, I’ll kneel down"
      - "And ask of thee forgiveness. So we’ll live,"
      - "And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh"
      - "At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues"
      - "Talk of court news, and we’ll talk with them too—"
      - "Who loses and who wins, who’s in, who’s out—"
      - "And take upon ’s the mystery of things"
      - "As if we were God’s spies. And we’ll wear out"
      - "In a walled prison packs and sects of great ones"
      - "That ebb and flow by the moon."
    m:
      - "No, no, no, no! Come on, let’s go to prison. The two of us together will sing like birds in a cage. We will be good to each other. When you ask for my blessing, I’ll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me. That’s how we’ll live—we’ll pray, we’ll sing, we’ll tell old stories, we’ll laugh at pretentious courtiers, we’ll listen to nasty court gossip, we’ll find out who’s losing and who’s winning, who’s in and who’s out. We’ll think about the mysteries of the universe as if we were God’s spies. In prison we’ll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change."

      - "And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes."
      - "The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell,"
      - "Ere they shall make us weep. We’ll see ’em starve first."
      - "Come."
    m:
      - "My Cordelia, even the gods admire how much you’ve sacrificed for me. Have I hugged you yet? Anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes. Wipe your eyes. Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again. We’ll watch them starve to death first. Come on."

    m:
      - "Come here, captain. Listen. *(gives the FIRST CAPTAIN a sheet of paper)* Take this note. Follow those two to prison and follow these instructions. I’ve already promoted you once. If you do as you’re told, you’ll be richly rewarded. Just remember this: you have to go with the times, and these are the times for being tough. A soldier can’t afford to be a ninny. There’ll be no quibbling about this assignment. Either you accept it, or go find some other way to support yourself."

  - sp: FIRST CAPTAIN
    o:
      - "  I’ll do ’t, my lord."

      - "If it be man’s work, I’ll do ’t."
    m:

  - sp: ALBANY
    o:
      - "*(to EDMUND)* Sir, you have shown today your valiant strain,"
      - "And fortune led you well. You have the captives"
      - "That were the opposites of this day’s strife."
      - "I do require them of you, so to use them"
      - "As we shall find their merits and our safety"
      - "May equally determine."
    m:
      - "*(to EDMUND)* Sir, you’ve shown your true courage today, and luck was on your side. You’ve taken prisoner the leaders of the opposition. I need to take cus- tody of them so I can do what’s best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "  Sir, I thought it fit"
      - "To send the old and miserable king"
      - "To some retention and appointed guard—"
      - "Whose age has charms in it, whose title more—"
      - "To pluck the common bosom on his side,"
      - "An turn our impressed lances in our eyes"
      - "Which do command them. With him I sent the queen,"

      - "Where you shall hold your session. At this time"
      - "We sweat and bleed. The friend hath lost his friend,"
      - "And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed"
      - "By those that feel their sharpness."
      - "The question of Cordelia and her father"
      - "Requires a fitter place."
    m:
      - "Sir, I decided it was appropriate to send the pathetic old king to a guarded prison cell. His old age and his title make him so popular among the commoners that I was worried our enlisted soldiers would turn against us on his behalf. I sent the French queen with him too, for the same reason. They’re ready to meet with you tomorrow, or whenever you like, wherever you’d like to hold your hearing. These are difficult times. Many have lost friends in battle, and soldiers will curse even a justified war if it causes them pain. We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father."

  - sp: ALBANY
    o:
      - "I hold you but a subject of this war,"
      - "Not as a brother."
    m:
      - "I’m sorry, sir, but in this war I consider you a subordinate, not my equal."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "  That’s as we list to grace him."
      - "Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded"
      - "Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,"
      - "Bore the commission of my place and person—"
      - "The which immediacy may well stand up"
      - "And call itself your brother."
    m:
      - "That’s for to me to decide. You might have asked my opinion before saying something so rude. Edmund has led our forces well, and implemented my wishes—and his close connection with me gives him the right to be considered your equal."

  - sp: GONERIL
    o:
      - "    Not so hot."
      - "In his own grace he doth exalt himself"
      - "More than in your addition."
    m:
      - "Not so fast. He has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right, deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "    In my rights,"
      - "By me invested, he compeers the best."
    m:
      - "I’m the one who gave him his military commission, and it is as my proxy that he fought bravely."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:

    m:

      - "That eye that told you so looked but asquint."
    m:

      - "Witness the world that I create thee here"
      - "My lord and master."
    m:
      - "Hey, lady, if I weren’t feeling a little sick, I’d give you a piece of my mind. *(to EDMUND)* General, take my soldiers, my prisoners, my whole inheritance, and do as you like with them. I surrender myself to your good judgment. Let the whole world see that I hereby make you my lord and master."

  - sp: GONERIL
    o:
      - "  Mean you to enjoy him then?"
    m:

    m:

  - sp: ALBANY
    o:

      - "On capital treason, and in thine attaint"

      - "*(to REGAN)* For your claim, fair sister,"
      - "I bar it in the interest of my wife."
      - "’Tis she is subcontracted to this lord."
      - "And I, her husband, contradict your banns."
      - "If you will marry, make your loves to me,"
      - "My lady is bespoke."
    m:
      - "Hang on a second. Listen to me.—Edmund, you’re under arrest for capital treason. Along with you, your co-conspirator, this snake of a woman. *(points at GONERIL. Then, speaking to REGAN)* My dear sister-in-law, I veto your marriage announcement for the benefit of my wife, who is already engaged to Edmund. So if you want to get married, you’ll have to woo me. My wife’s already spoken for."

It’s the symbol of my honor, my rank, and my status as a knight. In spite of your youth, rank, strength, and excellence at warfare, in spite of your courage, your recent victory, and your good luck, I declare that you’re a traitor. You’ve betrayed your gods, your brother, and your father. You’ve plotted against this noble duke. You’re a rotten traitor, through and through, from the top of your head to the soles of your feet.
