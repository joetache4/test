<p>The reason is your spirits are attentive.</p>
<p>For do but note a wild and wanton herd,</p>
<p>Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,</p>
<p>Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,</p>
<p>Which is the hot condition of their blood—</p>
<p>If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,</p>
<p>Or any air of music touch their ears,</p>
<p>You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,</p>
<p>Their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze</p>
<p>By the sweet power of music.</p>
<p>Therefore the poet</p>
<p>Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods</p>
<p>Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,</p>
<p>But music for the time doth change his nature.</p>
<p>The man that hath no music in himself,</p>
<p>Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,</p>
<p>Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.</p>
<p>The motions of his spirit are dull as night,</p>
<p>And his affections dark as Erebus.</p>
<p>Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>LORENZO</b>
<p>That’s because your soul is paying attention to the music. Take a wild herd of animals, or young untrained colts, leaping around like crazy, roaring and neighing loudly, which they have to do because it’s in their blood—but if they happen to hear a trumpet, or any kind of music, they all stand still. Sweet music makes their wild eyes peaceful. That’s why the poet Ovid wrote that the great musician Orpheus could make trees, stones, and rivers come to him by playing music. There’s nothing in the world that can resist music. The man who can’t be moved by the harmonious melodies is fit only for treason, violence, and pillage. His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld. Nobody like that should be trusted. Pay attention to the music.</p>

<b>NERISSA</b>
<p>How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring? You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died, and that it would be buried with you. If you didn’t want to take care of it for my sake, you should have just because you made so many vows that you’d take care of it. And now you claim you gave it to a judge’s clerk! No, I swear to God that clerk will never grow a beard on his face.</p>

<p>I have to be honest with you. You were wrong to give away your wife’s first gift so thoughtlessly, a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body. I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away. And here he is. I’d swear he wouldn’t leave it behind, or even take it off his finger, for all the money in the world. To tell the truth, Gratiano, you’re giving your wife a valid reason to get upset. If it were me, I’d be very upset too.</p>
