      - "Have we marched on without impediment,"
      - "Thus far into the bowels of the land"
      - "And here receive we from our father Stanley"

      - "Fellow soldiers and my loyal friends suffering under that tyrant Richard, we have marched all the way to the center of England without encountering any opposition. And now we receive encouraging news from my stepfather Stanley: Richard—that violent, greedy boar who roots through your summer fields and ripening vines, guzzles your warm blood, and makes his trough in your disemboweled bellies—is now near the town of Leicester, only one day’s march from us here in Tamworth. In God’s name, let’s continue on in high spirits, my courageous friends. Our aim is to achieve everlasting peace from this one violent war."

    m:
      - "He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him. In his greatest need, even they will desert him."

  - sp: RICHMOND
    o:
      - "All for our vantage. Then, in God’s name, march."
      - "True hope is swift, and flies with swallow’s wings."
      - "Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings."
    m:
      - "All to our advantage. So, in God’s name, let’s march. Hope with good cause is swift; it flies as fast as a swallow. It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings."
