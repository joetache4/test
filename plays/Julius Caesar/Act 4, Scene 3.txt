    ms: "BRUTUS and CASSIUS remain onstage. They are now in their tent."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "That you have wronged me doth appear in this:"
      - "You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella"
      - "For taking bribes here of the Sardians,"
      - "Wherein my letters, praying on his side"
      - "Because I knew the man, were slighted off."
    m:
      - "My evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians, and you ignored my letters, where I argued that he was innocent; I know the man."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "You wronged yourself to write in such a case."
    m:
      - "You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "In such a time as this it is not meet"
      - "That every nice offense should bear his comment."
    m:
      - "In a time like this, it doesn’t make sense to criticize every offense."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself"
      - "Are much condemned to have an itching palm,"
      - "To sell and mart your offices for gold"
      - "To undeservers."
    m:
      - "I’ll tell you, Cassius, you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "  I “an itching palm”!"
      - "You know that you are Brutus that speak this,"
      - "Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last."
    m:
      - "Me, “greedy”! You know, if you were anyone other than Brutus, that speech would be your last."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "The name of Cassius honors this corruption,"
      - "And chastisement doth therefore hide his head."
    m:
      - "The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions, and so they go unpunished."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "Chastisement!"
    m:
      - "Unpunished!"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Remember March, the ides of March remember."
      - "Did not great Julius bleed for justice’ sake?"
      - "What villain touched his body, that did stab,"
      - "And not for justice? What, shall one of us"
      - "That struck the foremost man of all this world"
      - "But for supporting robbers, shall we now"
      - "Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,"
      - "And sell the mighty space of our large honors"
      - "For so much trash as may be graspèd thus?"
      - "I had rather be a dog and bay the moon"
      - "Than such a Roman."
    m:
      - "Remember March, March 15th. Didn’t great Caesar bleed for the sake of justice? Who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice? What—did one of us strike down the most powerful man in the world in order to support robbers? Should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on? I’d rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "    Brutus, bait not me."
      - "I’ll not endure it. You forget yourself"
      - "To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,"
      - "Older in practice, abler than yourself"
      - "To make conditions."
    m:
      - "Brutus, do not provoke me. I will not take it. You’re forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner. I’m a soldier, more experienced than you, and better able to give orders."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Go to. You are not, Cassius."
    m:
      - "Get lost! You are not, Cassius."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "I am."
    m:
      - "I am."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "I say you are not."
    m:
      - "I say you’re not."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "Urge me no more, I shall forget myself."
      - "Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further."
    m:
      - "Don’t provoke me any further or I’ll forget to restrain myself. If you care about your health, you won’t push me any further."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Away, slight man!"
    m:
      - "Leave, you little man."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "Is ’t possible?"
    m:
      - "Is this possible?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Hear me, for I will speak."
      - "Must I give way and room to your rash choler?"
      - "Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?"
    m:
      - "Listen to me, for I have something to tell you. Am I required to indulge your rash anger? Does a madman scare me when he stares at me?"

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "O ye gods, ye gods, must I endure all this?"
    m:
      - "Oh gods, oh gods! Must I endure all this?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "“All this”? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break."
      - "Go show your slaves how choleric you are"
      - "And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?"
      - "Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch"
      - "Under your testy humor? By the gods,"
      - "You shall digest the venom of your spleen,"
      - "Though it do split you. For from this day forth,"
      - "I’ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,"
      - "When you are waspish."
    m:
      - "“All this”? Yes, and more. Go ahead—rage till your proud heart breaks. Show your slaves how mad you are, and make your servants tremble. But me—am I going to cower at you and your irritable moods? You’ll have to swallow your own poison till it makes you burst before I’m going to respond; from now on, I’ll make you the butt of my jokes whenever you get sharp with me."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "    Is it come to this?"
    m:
      - "Has it come to this?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "You say you are a better soldier."
      - "Let it appear so. Make your vaunting true,"
      - "And it shall please me well. For mine own part,"
      - "I shall be glad to learn of noble men."
    m:
      - "You say you’re a better soldier. Show it! Make your boasts come true, and I’ll be thrilled. I’m always happy to hear about brave men."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "You wrong me every way. You wrong me, Brutus."
      - "I said an elder soldier, not a better."
      - "Did I say “better”?"
    m:
      - "You wrong me in every way. You wrong me, Brutus. I said an *older* soldier, not a better one. Did I say “better”?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "If you did, I care not."
    m:
      - "If you did, I don’t care."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me."
    m:
      - "When Caesar was alive, even he wouldn’t dare anger me like this."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him."
    m:
      - "Oh, be quiet. You wouldn’t have dared to tempt him so."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "I durst not!"
    m:
      - "I wouldn’t have dared!"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "No."
    m:
      - "No."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "What, durst not tempt him?"
    m:
      - "What? Not dared to tempt him?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "For your life you durst not."
    m:
      - "You wouldn’t have dared, out of fear for your life."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "Do not presume too much upon my love."
      - "I may do that I shall be sorry for."
    m:
      - "Don’t take my love for granted. I might do something I’ll be sorry for."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "You have done that you should be sorry for."
      - "There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,"
      - "For I am armed so strong in honesty"
      - "That they pass by me as the idle wind,"
      - "Which I respect not. I did send to you"
      - "For certain sums of gold, which you denied me,"
      - "For I can raise no money by vile means."
      - "By heaven, I had rather coin my heart"
      - "And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring"
      - "From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash"
      - "By any indirection. I did send"
      - "To you for gold to pay my legions,"
      - "Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?"
      - "Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?"
      - "When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous"
      - "To lock such rascal counters from his friends,"
      - "Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts."
      - "Dash him to pieces!"
    m:
      - "You’ve already done something you should be sorry for. Your threats don’t scare me, Cassius, because I’m so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze. I asked you for a certain amount of gold, which you wouldn’t give me. I myself can’t raise money by unethical means. I’d rather turn my heart into money and my drops of blood into coins than use crooked tactics to wring petty cash from the hardworking hands of peasants. I asked you for gold to pay my soldiers, and you wouldn’t give it to me. Was that the Caius Cassius that I knew? And would I have ever done that to you? If I ever get so greedy that I hoard such petty cash from my friends, may the gods dash me to pieces with their thunderbolts!"

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "    I denied you not."
    m:
      - "I didn’t refuse you."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "You did."
    m:
      - "You did."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "  I did not. He was but a fool that brought"
      - "My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart."
      - "A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities,"
      - "But Brutus makes mine greater than they are."
    m:
      - "I didn’t. The man who brought my answer to you was a fool. You have broken my heart. A friend should put up with his friend’s weaknesses, but you exaggerate mine."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "I do not, till you practice them on me."
    m:
      - "I don’t until you practice them on me."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "You love me not."
    m:
      - "You don’t love me."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "    I do not like your faults."
    m:
      - "I don’t like your faults."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "A friendly eye could never see such faults."
    m:
      - "A friend would never see those faults."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "A flatterer’s would not, though they do appear"
      - "As huge as high Olympus."
    m:
      - "No, a flatterer wouldn’t, even if the faults were as huge as Mount Olympus."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,"
      - "Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,"
      - "For Cassius is aweary of the world—"
      - "Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;"
      - "Checked like a bondman, all his faults observed,"
      - "Set in a notebook, learned, and conned by rote"
      - "To cast into my teeth. Oh, I could weep"
      - "My spirit from mine eyes."
      - "*(offers BRUTUS his bared dagger)* There is my dagger."
      - "And here my naked breast. Within, a heart"
      - "Dearer than Plutus’ mine, richer than gold."
      - "If that thou beest a Roman, take it forth."
      - "I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart."
      - "Strike, as thou didst at Caesar. For I know"
      - "When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better"
      - "Than ever thou lovedst Cassius."
    m:
      - "Come, Antony and young Octavius! Get your revenge on Cassius, because Cassius has grown tired of the world. He’s hated by someone he loves, defied by his brother, rebuked like a servant, all his faults observed, catalogued in a notebook, read, and committed to memory so they can be thrown in his face. Oh, I could weep my soul right out of myself! There’s my dagger *(he offers BRUTUS his unsheathed dagger)*, and here’s my bare chest. Inside it is a heart more valuable than Pluto’s silver mine and richer than gold. If you’re a Roman, take my heart out. I, who denied you gold, will give you my heart. Strike as you did at Caesar, for I know even when you hated him the most, you still loved him better than you ever loved me."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "    Sheathe your dagger."
      - "Be angry when you will, it shall have scope."
      - "Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor."
      - "O Cassius, you are yokèd with a lamb"
      - "That carries anger as the flint bears fire,"
      - "Who, much enforcèd, shows a hasty spark"
      - "And straight is cold again."
    m:
      - "Put away your dagger. Be angry whenever you like, it’s all right with me. Do whatever you want, and I’ll say your insults are just a bad mood. Oh, Cassius, you’re partners with a quiet lamb. My anger is like a flint striking—a brief spark, and then I’m cold again."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "    Hath Cassius lived"
      - "To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,"
      - "When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him?"
    m:
      - "Have I lived this long only to be the butt of a joke whenever you’re angry or frustrated?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too."
    m:
      - "When I said that, I was angry too."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:

    m:
      - "You admit it, then? Give me your hand."

      - "When that rash humor which my mother gave me"
      - "Makes me forgetful?"
    m:
      - "Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper, which I inherited from my mother, makes me forget how I should behave?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "    Yes, Cassius. And from henceforth"
      - "When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,"
      - "He’ll think your mother chides and leave you so."
    m:
      - "Yes, Cassius. And from now on, when you get hot with me, I’ll assume it’s your mother speaking and leave it at that."
