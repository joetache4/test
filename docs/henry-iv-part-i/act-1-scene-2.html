<p>Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? Unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping-houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-colored taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day.</p>

<p>You are so wasted from drinking booze and loosening your pants after lunch and sleeping on benches all afternoon that you don’t even remember how to ask for what you really want to know. What the hell does it matter to you what time it is? Unless hours were glasses of wine, minutes were chickens, clocks were whores’ tongues, sundials were whorehouse signs and the sun itself were a hot woman in a flame-colored dress, I don’t see any reason why you would need to know the time.</p>

<b>PRINCE HENRY</b>
<p>Well said. And you’re right—our luck ebbs and flows like the tide, because, like the sea, we’re governed by the moon. I’ll prove it. Imagine a bag of gold, brilliantly swiped on a Monday night and extravagantly spent on a Tuesday morning. You snatch it, shouting, “Hand it off!” and spend it, calling, “Bring it on!” It’s like the gallows: one minute you’re at the bottom of the ladder—low tide. The next, you’re swinging from the top—high tide!</p>

<b>POINS</b>
<p>Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I’ll forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty at least he fought with, what wards, what blows, what extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this lies the jest.</p>

<b>POINS</b>
<p>Well, I know that two of them are the biggest cowards who ever turned and ran. As for the third, if he fights even a second longer than is absolutely necessary, I promise to never fight again. The best part about this joke will be listening to the outlandish lies this fat clown will tell when we meet for dinner—how he fought at least thirty men, how he defended himself, how he got hit, what he endured. The funniest part will be when we call him on it.</p>

<b>PRINCE HENRY</b>
<p>I know you all, and will awhile uphold</p>
<p>The unyoked humor of your idleness.</p>
<p>Yet herein will I imitate the sun,</p>
<p>Who doth permit the base contagious clouds</p>
<p>To smother up his beauty from the world,</p>
<p>That, when he please again to be himself,</p>
<p>Being wanted, he may be more wondered at</p>
<p>By breaking through the foul and ugly mist</p>
<p>Of vapors that did seem to strangle him.</p>
<p>If all the year were playing holidays,</p>
<p>To sport would be as tedious as to work,</p>
<p>But when they seldom come, they wished for come,</p>
<p>And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.</p>
<p>So when this loose behavior I throw off</p>
<p>And pay the debt I never promisèd,</p>
<p>By how much better than my word I am,</p>
<p>By so much shall I falsify men’s hopes;</p>
<p>And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,</p>
<p>My reformation, glitt’ring o’er my fault,</p>
<p>Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes</p>
<p>Than that which hath no foil to set it off.</p>
<p>I’ll so offend to make offense a skill,</p>
<p>Redeeming time when men think least I will.</p>

<b>PRINCE HENRY</b>
<p>I understand all of you. For now, I’ll put on the rowdy behavior of your good-for-nothing ways. But in this way, I’ll be like the sun, who allows the vulgar, corrupting clouds to hide his beauty from the world. Then, when the sun wants to be himself again, he breaks through the foul mists and vapors that seemed to be strangling him. And because people have missed him so much, they are that much more impressed when he finally appears. If every day were a vacation, playing would grow as tedious as working. But when it’s rare, it’s looked forward to. Nothing is as precious as the unexpected occurrence. So when I throw off this wild behavior and accept the responsibilities of being king—a destiny I didn’t choose but was born into—I’ll suddenly seem like a far better man. In this way, I’ll give everyone the wrong expectation of me. Like a bright metal on a dark background, my reformation will shine even more brilliantly when it’s set against my wicked past. I’ll be so wild, I’ll make wildness an art form, then redeem myself when the world least expects me to.</p>
