<b>CHORUS</b>
<p>Two households, both alike in dignity</p>
<p>(In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),</p>
<p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
<p>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
<p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
<p>A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life,</p>
<p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</p>
<p>Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.</p>
<p>The fearful passage of their death-marked love</p>
<p>And the continuance of their parents’ rage,</p>
<p>Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove,</p>
<p>Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage—</p>
<p>The which, if you with patient ears attend,</p>
<p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

<b>CHORUS</b>
<p>In the beautiful city of Verona, where our story takes place, a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence, and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens. Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide. Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents’ feud. For the next two hours, we will watch the story of their doomed love and their parents’ anger, which nothing but the children’s deaths could stop. If you listen to us patiently, we’ll make up for everything we’ve left out in this prologue onstage.</p>

<b>MONTAGUE</b>
<p>He’s been seen there many mornings, crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs. But as soon as the sun rises in the east, my sad son comes home to escape the light. He locks himself up alone in his bedroom, shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight, and makes himself an artificial night. This mood of his is going to bring bad news, unless someone smart can fix what’s bothering him.</p>

It’s a sweet lozenge that you choke on. Goodbye, cousin.</p>

Well, Susan died and is with God. She was too good for me. But like I said, on the night of Lammas Eve, she will be fourteen. Yes, she will. Indeed, I remember it well. It’s been eleven years since the earthquake. She stopped nursing from my breast on that very day. I’ll never forget it. I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun, under the wall of the dovehouse. You and your husband were in Mantua. Boy, do I have some memory! But like I said, when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple, the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast. Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake. There was no need to tell me to get out of there. That was eleven years ago. By then she could stand up all by herself. No, I swear, by that time she could run and waddle all around. I remember because she had cut her forehead just the day before. My husband—God rest his soul, he was a happy man—picked up the child. “Oh,” he said, “Did you fall on your face? You’ll fall backward when you grow smarter. Won’t you, Jule.” And I swear, the poor pretty thing stopped crying and said, “Yes.” Oh, to watch a joke come true! I bet if I live a thousand years, I’ll never forget it. “Won’t you, Jule,” he said. And the pretty fool stopped crying and said, “Yes.”</p>

<p>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,</p>

<p>Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.</p>
<p>Her chariot is an empty hazelnut</p>
<p>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,</p>
<p>Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.</p>
<p>And in this state she gallops night by night</p>
<p>Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;</p>
<p>On courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;</p>
<p>O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;</p>
<p>O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,</p>
<p>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,</p>
<p>Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.</p>
<p>Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,</p>
<p>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.</p>
<p>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail</p>
<p>Tickling a parson’s nose as he lies asleep,</p>
<p>Then he dreams of another benefice.</p>
<p>Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,</p>
<p>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</p>
<p>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,</p>
<p>Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon</p>
<p>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</p>
<p>And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two</p>
<p>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</p>
<p>That plaits the manes of horses in the night</p>
<p>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,</p>
<p>Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes.</p>
<p>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</p>

<b>MERCUTIO</b>
<p>She’s the fairies’ midwife. She’s no bigger than the stone on a city councilman’s ring. She rides around in a wagon drawn by tiny little atoms, and she rides over men’s noses as they lie sleeping. The spokes of her wagon are made of spiders’ legs. The cover of her wagon is made of grasshoppers’ wings. The harnesses are made of the smallest spiderwebs. The collars are made out of moonbeams. Her whip is a thread attached to a cricket’s bone. Her wagon driver is a tiny bug in a gray coat; he’s not half the size of a little round worm that comes from the finger of a lazy young girl. Her chariot is a hazelnut shell. It was made by a carpenter squirrel or an old grubworm; they’ve made wagons for the fairies as long as anyone can remember. In this royal wagon, she rides every night through the brains of lovers and makes them dream about love. She rides over courtiers’ knees, and they dream about curtsying. She rides over lawyers’ fingers, and right away, they dream about their fees. She rides over ladies’ lips, and they immediately dream of kisses. Queen Mab often puts blisters on their lips because their breath smells like candy, which makes her mad. Sometimes she rides over a courtier’s lips, and he dreams of making money off of someone. Sometimes she tickles a priest’s nose with a tithe-pigs tail, and he dreams of a large donation. Sometimes she rides over a soldier’s neck, and he dreams of cutting the throats of foreign enemies, of breaking down walls, of ambushes, of Spanish swords, and of enormous cups of liquor. And then, drums beat in his ear and he wakes up. He’s frightened, so he says a couple of prayers and goes back to sleep. She is the same Mab who tangles the hair in horses’ manes at night and makes the tangles hard in the dirty hairs, which bring bad luck if they’re untangled. Mab is the old hag who gives false sex dreams to virgins and teaches them how to hold a lover and bear a child. She’s the one—</p>

<b>CHORUS</b>
<p>Now Romeo’s old feelings of desire are dying, and a new desire is eager to take their place. Romeo groaned for the beautiful Rosaline and said he would die for her, but compared with tender Juliet, Rosaline doesn’t seem beautiful now. Now someone loves Romeo, and he’s in love again—both of them falling for each others’ good looks. But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who’s supposed to be his enemy. And she’s been hooked by someone she should fear. Because he’s an enemy, Romeo has no chance to see Juliet and say the things a lover normally says. And Juliet’s just as much in love as he, but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover. But love gives them power, and time gives them the chance to meet, sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure.</p>

<p><em>(still not knowing ROMEO hears her)</em> It’s only your name that’s my enemy. You’d still be yourself even if you stopped being a Montague. What’s a Montague anyway? It isn’t a hand, a foot, an arm, a face, or any other part of a man. Oh, be some other name! What does a name mean? The thing we call a rose would smell just as sweet if we called it by any other name. Romeo would be just as perfect even if he wasn’t called Romeo. Romeo, lose your name. Trade in your name—which really has nothing to do with you—and take all of me in exchange.</p>

Or if you think it’s too easy and quick to win my heart, I’ll frown and play hard-to-get, as long as that will make you try to win me, but otherwise I wouldn’t act that way for anything. In truth, handsome Montague, I like you too much, so you may think my behavior is loose. But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove myself more faithful than girls who act coy and play hard-to-get. I should have been more standoffish, I confess, but you overheard me talking about the love in my heart when I didn’t know you were there.

<p>The smiling morning is replacing the frowning night. Darkness is stumbling out of the sun’s path like a drunk man. Now, before the sun comes up and burns away the dew, I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers. The Earth is nature’s mother and also nature’s tomb. Plants are born out of the Earth, and they are buried in the Earth when they die. From the Earth’s womb, many different sorts of plants and animals come forth, and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment. Evertything nature creates has some special property, and each one is different. Herbs, plants, and stones possess great power. There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality. And there is nothing that does not turn bad if it’s put to the wrong use and abused. Virtue turns to vice if it’s misused. Vice sometimes becomes virtue through the right activity.</p>

<p>Inside the little rind of this weak flower, there is both poison and powerful medicine. If you smell it, you feel good all over your body. But if you taste it, you die. There are two opposite elements in everything, in men as well as in herbs—good and evil. When evil is dominant, death soon kills the body like cancer.</p>

<p>God bless you. Who greets me so early in the morning? Young man, something’s wrong if you’re getting out of bed this early. Every old man has worries, and worried men never get any sleep, but young men shouldn’t have a care in the world. They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep. Therefore, the fact that you’re awake this early tells me you’ve been upset with some anxiety. If that’s not the case, then this must be the answer: You, Romeo, have not been to bed tonight.</p>

That’s three hours since nine o’clock, but she hasn’t come back. If she was young and passionate, she’d move as fast as a ball. My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his words would bounce her back to me. But a lot of old people act like they’re already dead—sluggish, slow, fat, and colorless, like lead.</p>

<p>Tybalt started the fight before he was killed by Romeo. Romeo spoke to Tybalt politely and told him how silly this argument was. He mentioned that you would not approve of the fight. He said all of this gently and calmly, kneeling down out of respect. But he could not make peace with Tybalt, who was in an angry mood and wouldn’t listen to talk about peace. Tybalt and Mercutio began to fight each other fiercely, lunging at one another and dodging each other’s blows. Romeo cried out, “Stop, my friends. Break it up.” Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down. But Tybalt reached under Romeo’s arm and thrust his sword into brave Mercutio. Then Tybalt fled the scene. But pretty soon he came back to meet Romeo, who was overcome with the desire for revenge. As quick as lightning, they started fighting. Before I could break up the fight, Tybalt was killed. Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead. I’m telling you the truth, I swear on my life.</p>

I wish night would come, like a widow dressed in black, so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity. Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed. In the darkness, let me, a shy virgin, learn the strange act of sex so that it seems innocent, modest, and true. Come, night. Come, Romeo. You’re like a day that comes during the night. You’re whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven. Come, gentle night. Come, loving, dark night. Give me my Romeo. And when I die, turn him into stars and form a constellation in his image. His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun. Oh, I have bought love’s mansion, but I haven’t moved in yet.I belong to Romeo now, but he hasn’t taken possession of me yet. This day is so boring that I feel like a child on the night before a holiday, waiting to put on my fancy new clothes.</p>

<p>When I, thy three hours’ wife, have mangled it?</p>
<p>But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?</p>
<p>That villain cousin would have killed my husband.</p>
<p>Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring.</p>
<p>Your tributary drops belong to woe,</p>
<p>Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.</p>
<p>My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,</p>
<p>And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.</p>
<p>All this is comfort. Wherefore weep I then?</p>
<p>Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,</p>
<p>That murdered me. I would forget it fain,</p>
<p>But oh, it presses to my memory,</p>
<p>Like damnèd guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.</p>
<p>“Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banishèd.”</p>
<p>That “banishèd,” that one word “banishèd”</p>
<p>Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death</p>
<p>Was woe enough, if it had ended there.</p>
<p>Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship</p>
<p>And needly will be ranked with other griefs,</p>
<p>Why followed not, when she said “Tybalt’s dead,”</p>
<p>“Thy father” or “thy mother,” nay, or both,</p>
<p>Which modern lamentations might have moved?</p>
<p>But with a rearward following Tybalt’s death,</p>
<p>“Romeo is banishèd.” To speak that word,</p>
<p>Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,</p>
<p>All slain, all dead. “Romeo is banishèd.”</p>
<p>There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,</p>
<p>In that word’s death. No words can that woe sound.</p>
<p>Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?</p>

<b>JULIET</b>
<p>Am I supposed to say bad things about my own husband? Ah, my poor husband, who will sing your praises when I, your wife of three hours, have been saying awful things about you? But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin? Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband. I’m not going to cry any tears. I would cry with joy that Romeo is alive, but I should cry tears of grief because Tybalt is dead. My husband, whom Tybalt wanted to kill, is alive. Tybalt, who wanted to kill my husband, is dead. All this is comforting news. Why, then, should I cry? There is news worse than the news that Tybalt is dead, news that makes me want to die. I would be glad to forget about it, but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds. “Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.” That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death would be bad enough if that was all. Maybe pain likes to have company and can’t come without bringing more pain. It would have been better if, after she said, “Tybalt’s dead,” she told me my mother or my father, or both, were gone. That would have made me make the normal cries of sadness. But to say that Tybalt’s dead and then say, “Romeo has been banished.” To say that is like saying that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet have all been killed, they’re all dead. “Romeo has been banished.” That news brings infinite death. No words can express the pain. Where are my father and my mother, Nurse?</p>

<p>It’s torture, not mercy. Heaven is here because Juliet lives here. Every cat and dog and little mouse, every unworthy animal that lives here can see her, but Romeo can’t. Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo. They can take hold of Juliet’s wonderful white hand and they can kiss her sweet lips. Even while she remains a pure virgin, she blushes when her lips touch each other because she thinks it’s a sin. But Romeo can’t kiss her or hold her hand because he’s been banished. Flies can kiss her, but I must flee the city. Flies are like free men, but I have been banished. And yet you say that exile is not death? Did you have no poison, no sharp knife, no weapon you could use to kill me quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except banishment? Oh Friar, damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell. They howl about banishment. If you’re a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins, and you say you’re my friend, how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment?</p>

Why do you complain about your birth, the heavens, and the earth? Life is the union of soul in body through the miracle of birth, but you would throw all that away. You bring shame to your body, your love, and your mind. You have so much natural talent, but like someone who hoards money, you use none of your talent for the right purpose—not your body, not your love, not your mind. Your body is just a wax figure, without the honor of a man. The love that you promised was a hollow lie. You’re killing the love that you vowed to cherish. Your mind, which aids both your body and your love, has mishandled both of them. You’re like a stupid soldier whose gunpowder explodes because he’s careless. The things you were supposed to use to defend yourself end up killing you. Get up, man! Your Juliet is alive. It was for her that you were almost killed earlier. Be happy that she’s alive. Tybalt wanted to kill you, but you killed Tybalt. Be happy that you’re alive. The law that threatened your life was softened into exile. Be happy about that. Your life is full of blessings. You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy. But like a misbehaved, sullen girl, you’re whining about your bad luck and your love. Listen, listen, people who act like that die miserable. Go be with your love, as it was decided at your wedding. Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her. But get out of there before the night watchmen take their positions. Then you will escape to the city of Mantua, where you’ll live until we can make your marriage public and make peace between your families. We’ll ask the Prince to pardon you. Then we’ll welcome you back with twenty thousand times more joy than you’ll have when you leave this town crying. Go ahead, Nurse. Give my regards to your lady, and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed. I’m sure they’re all so sad that they’ll be ready to sleep. Romeo is coming.</p>

<p>I’ll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him . . . dead—dead is how my poor heart feels when I think about my poor cousin. Madam, if you can find a man to deliver the poison, I’ll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it. Oh, how I hate to hear people say his name and not be able to go after him. I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him.</p>

But this wretched, whimpering fool, like a whining puppet, she looks at this good fortune and answers, “I won’t get married. I can’t fall in love. I’m too young. Please, excuse me.” Well, if you won’t get married, I’ll excuse you. Eat wherever you want, but you can no longer live under my roof. Consider that. Think about it. I’m not in the habit of joking. Thursday is coming. Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice. If you act like my daughter, I’ll marry you to my friend. If you don’t act like my daughter, you can beg, starve, and die in the streets. I swear on my soul, I will never take you back or do anything for you. Believe me. Think about it.

<p>Hold on, then. Go home, be cheerful, and tell them you agree to marry Paris. Tomorrow is Wednesday. Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone. Don’t let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom. <em>(showing her a vial)</em> When you’re in bed, take this vial, mix its contents with liquor, and drink. Then a cold, sleep-inducing drug will run through your veins, and your pulse will stop. Your flesh will be cold, and you’ll stop breathing. The red in your lips and your cheeks will turn pale, and your eyes will shut. It will seem like you’re dead. You won’t be able to move, and your body will be stiff like a corpse. You’ll remain in this deathlike state for forty-two hours, and then you’ll wake up as if from a pleasant sleep. Now, when the bridegroom comes to get you out of bed on Thursday morning, you’ll seem dead. Then, as tradition demands, you’ll be dressed up in your best clothes, put in an open coffin, and carried to the Capulet family tomb. Meanwhile, I’ll send Romeo word of our plan. He’ll come here, and we’ll keep a watch for when you wake up. That night, Romeo will take you away to Mantua. This plan will free you from the shameful situation that troubles you now as long as you don’t change your mind, or become scared like a silly woman and ruin your brave effort.</p>

<p>Where for these many hundred years the bones</p>
<p>Of all my buried ancestors are packed;</p>
<p>Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,</p>
<p>Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,</p>
<p>At some hours in the night spirits resort—?</p>
<p>Alack, alack, is it not like that I,</p>
<p>So early waking, what with loathsome smells,</p>
<p>And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,</p>
<p>That living mortals, hearing them, run mad—?</p>
<p>Oh, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,</p>
<p>Environèd with all these hideous fears,</p>
<p>And madly play with my forefather’s joints,</p>
<p>And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,</p>
<p>And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,</p>
<p>As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?</p>
<p>Oh, look! Methinks I see my cousin’s ghost</p>
<p>Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body</p>
<p>Upon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!</p>
<p>Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here’s drink. I drink to thee.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>JULIET</b>
<p>Good-bye. Only God knows when we’ll meet again. There is a slight cold fear cutting through my veins. It almost freezes the heat of life. I’ll call them back here to comfort me. Nurse!—Oh, what good would she do here? In my desperate situation, I have to act alone. Alright, here’s the vial. What if this mixture doesn’t work at all? Will I be married tomorrow morning? No, no, this knife will stop it. Lie down right there. <em>(she lays down the knife)</em> What if the Friar mixed the potion to kill me? Is he worried that he will be disgraced if I marry Paris after he married me to Romeo? I’m afraid that it’s poison. And yet, it shouldn’t be poison because he is a trustworthy holy man. What if, when I am put in the tomb, I wake up before Romeo comes to save me? That’s a frightening idea. Won’t I suffocate in the tomb? There’s no healthy air to breathe in there. Will I die of suffocation before Romeo comes? Or if I live, I’ll be surrounded by death and darkness. It will be terrible. There will be bones hundreds of years old in that tomb, my ancestors’ bones. Tybalt’s body will be in there, freshly entombed, and his corpse will be rotting. They say that during the night the spirits are in tombs. Oh no, oh no. I’ll wake up and smell awful odors. I’ll hear screams that would drive people crazy. If I wake up too early, won’t I go insane with all these horrible, frightening things around me, start playing with my ancestors’ bones, and pull Tybalt’s corpse out of his death shroud? Will I grab one of my dead ancestor’s bones and bash in my own skull? Oh, look! I think I see my cousin Tybalt’s ghost. He’s looking for Romeo because Romeo killed him with his sword. Wait, Tybalt, wait! Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here’s a drink. I drink to you.</p>

And now you cry, even though she has risen up above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? Oh, in this love, you love your child so badly, that you go mad, even though she is in heaven. It is best to marry well and die young, better than to be married for a long time. Dry up your tears, and put your rosemary on this beautiful corpse.

<p>Were thinly scattered to make up a show.</p>

<p>“An if a man did need a poison now”—</p>
<p>Whose sale is present death in Mantua—</p>
<p>“Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.”</p>
<p>Oh, this same thought did but forerun my need,</p>

<p>Well, Juliet, I’ll lie with you tonight. Let’s see how. Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men! I remember a pharmacist who lives nearby. I remember he wears shabby clothes and has bushy eyebrows. He makes drugs from herbs. He looks poor and miserable and worn out to the bone. He had a tortoise shell hanging up in his shop as well as a stuffed alligator and other skins of strange fish. There were a few empty boxes on his shelves, as well as green clay pots, and some musty seeds. There were a few strands of string and mashed rose petals on display. Noticing all this poverty, I said to myself, “If a man needed some poison”—which they would immediately kill you for selling in Mantua—“here is a miserable wretch who’d sell it to him.” Oh, this idea came before I needed the poison. But this same poor man must sell it to me. As I remember, this should be the house. Today’s a holiday, so the beggar’s shop is shut. Hey! Pharmacist!</p>

<b>FRIAR LAWRENCE</b>
<p>I will be brief, for my short date of breath</p>
<p>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</p>
<p>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,</p>
<p>And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.</p>
<p>I married them, and their stol’n marriage day</p>
<p>Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death</p>
<p>Banished the new-made bridegroom from the city—</p>
<p>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</p>
<p>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</p>
<p>Betrothed and would have married her perforce</p>
<p>To County Paris. Then comes she to me,</p>
<p>And with wild looks bid me devise some mean</p>
<p>To rid her from this second marriage,</p>
<p>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</p>
<p>Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,</p>
<p>A sleeping potion, which so took effect</p>
<p>As I intended, for it wrought on her</p>
<p>The form of death.</p>
<p>Meantime I writ to Romeo,</p>
<p>That he should hither come as this dire night,</p>
<p>To help to take her from her borrowed grave,</p>
<p>Being the time the potion’s force should cease.</p>
<p>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</p>
<p>Was stayed by accident, and yesternight</p>
<p>Returned my letter back. Then all alone</p>
<p>At the prefixèd hour of her waking</p>
<p>Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,</p>
<p>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell</p>
<p>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo,</p>
<p>But when I came, some minute ere the time</p>
<p>Of her awakening, here untimely lay</p>
<p>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</p>
<p>She wakes, and I entreated her come forth,</p>
<p>And bear this work of heaven with patience.</p>
<p>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,</p>
<p>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</p>
<p>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</p>
<p>All this I know, and to the marriage</p>
<p>Her Nurse is privy. And if aught in this</p>
<p>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</p>
<p>Be sacrificed some hour before his time</p>
<p>Unto the rigor of severest law.</p>
</td>

<b>FRIAR LAWRENCE</b>
<p>I will be brief because I’m not going to live long enough to tell a boring story. Romeo, who lies there dead, was the husband of that Juliet. And she, who lies there dead, was that Romeo’s faithful wife. I married them; their secret wedding day was the day Tybalt died. His untimely death caused the bridegroom to be banished from the city. Juliet was sad because Romeo was gone, not because of Tybalt’s death. To cure her sadness, you arranged a marriage for her with Count Paris. Then she came to me, and, looking wild, she asked me to devise a plan to get her out of this second marriage. She threatened to kill herself in my cell if I didn’t help her. So I gave her a sleeping potion that I had mixed with my special skills. It worked as planned. She seemed to everyone to be dead. In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off. But the man who carried my letter, Friar John, was held up by an accident. Last night he gave me the letter back. So I came here alone at the hour when she was supposed to wake up. I came to take her out of her family’s tomb, hoping to hide her in my cell until I could make contact with Romeo. But by the time I got here, just a few minutes before Juliet woke up, Paris and Romeo were already dead. She woke up, and I asked her to come out of the tomb with me and endure this tragedy with patience. But then a noise sent me running scared from the tomb. She was too desperate to come with me, and it seems that she killed herself. I know all of this. And her Nurse knows about the marriage too. If any part of this tragedy is my fault, let my old life be sacrificed and let me suffer the most severe punishment.</p>
