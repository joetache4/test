<p>My liege,</p>

<p>That very frankly he confessed his treasons,</p>
<p>Implored your highness’ pardon, and set forth</p>
<p>A deep repentance. Nothing in his life</p>
<p>Became him like the leaving it. He died</p>

<p>My king, they haven’t come back yet. But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die, and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons, begged your highness’ forgiveness, and repented deeply. He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died. He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage.</p>

<p>The opportunity to serve you is its own reward. Your only duty, your highness, is to accept what we owe you. Our duty to you and your state is like the duty of children to their father or servants to their master. By doing everything we can to protect you, we’re only doing what we should.</p>

<p>My joy is so overwhelming it brings tears to my eyes. My sons, relatives, lords, and all those closest to me, I want you to witness that I will bestow my kingdom on my eldest son, Malcolm.

But Malcolm isn’t going to be alone in receiving honors—titles of nobility will shine like stars on all of you who deserve them. <em>(to MACBETH)</em> And now, let’s go to your castle at Inverness, where I will become even more obliged to you because of your hospitality.</p>
