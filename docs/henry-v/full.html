<b>CHORUS</b>
<p>Oh, for a muse of fire that would ascend</p>
<p>The brightest heaven of invention!</p>
<p>A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,</p>
<p>And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!</p>
<p>Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,</p>
<p>Assume the port of Mars, and at his heels,</p>
<p>Leashed in like hounds, should famine, sword, and fire</p>
<p>Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all,</p>
<p>The flat unraisèd spirits that hath dared</p>
<p>On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth</p>
<p>So great an object. Can this cockpit hold</p>
<p>The vasty fields of France? Or may we cram</p>
<p>Within this wooden <em>O</em> the very casques</p>
<p>That did affright the air at Agincourt?</p>
<p>O pardon, since a crookèd figure may</p>
<p>Attest in little place a million,</p>
<p>And let us, ciphers to this great account,</p>
<p>On your imaginary forces work.</p>
<p>Suppose within the girdle of these walls</p>
<p>Are now confined two mighty monarchies</p>
<p>Whose high uprearèd and abutting fronts</p>
<p>The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.</p>
<p>Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.</p>
<p>Into a thousand parts divide one man,</p>
<p>And make imaginary puissance.</p>
<p>Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them</p>
<p>Printing their proud hoofs i’ th’ receiving earth,</p>
<p>For ’tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,</p>
<p>Carry them here and there, jumping o’er times,</p>
<p>Turning th’ accomplishment of many years</p>
<p>Into an hour-glass; for the which supply,</p>
<p>Admit me chorus to this history;</p>
<p>Who, prologue-like, your humble patience pray</p>
<p>Gently to hear, kindly to judge our play.</p>

<b>CHORUS</b>
<p>If only we had divine inspiration, our play might rise to the highest level of imagination. If we had a stage as big as a kingdom, real kings and queens to act the part of kings and queens, and royalty to also witness the glorious spectacle, then it would be as it really was. Then valiant King Harry would resemble the god of war, as he did in life, and famine, sword, and fire would sit like dogs at his feet, waiting to be unleashed. But, ladies and gentlemen, since that’s not the case, you must forgive us plain, ordinary men who dare to act out so great a story on this humble stage. Can this theater seem to contain the sweeping fields of France? Could we even squeeze into this little theater the helmets that looked so frightening at Agincourt? Hardly! But, pardon us, because just as a few strokes of a pen, a few zeros, can signify a huge number, we, who are zeros in this great story, can work on your imagination. Pretend that within the confines of this theater sit two great kingdoms divided by a narrow but perilous ocean. Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections. Divide each man into a thousand, and there you will have an imaginary army. Imagine, when we talk of horses, that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth. Because now it is your thoughts that must dress up our kings and transport them from place to place. Your thoughts must leap over huge spans of time, turning the events of many years into the space of a few hours. To that end, consider me a sort of chorus, here to help tell the story. And, as the speaker of any prologue should, I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly.</p>

<p>My lord, this bill that’s being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry’s reign.

<p>It must be thought on. If it pass against us,</p>
<p>We lose the better half of our possession,</p>
<p>For all the temporal lands which men devout</p>
<p>By testament have given to the Church</p>
<p>Would they strip from us, being valued thus:</p>
<p>“As much as would maintain, to the King’s honor,</p>
<p>Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,</p>
<p>Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;</p>
<p>And, to relief of lazars and weak age</p>
<p>Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,</p>

<b>CANTERBURY</b>
<p>We have to think about that. If it does pass, the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses, because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy, pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, six thousand two hundred squires, and a hundred well-supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers, old-age pensioners, the poor, and those too weak or sick to work. Add to that a yearly sum of a thousand pounds to go directly into the king’s coffers. That’s what the bill says.</p>

<p>The courses of his youth promised it not.</p>
<p>The breath no sooner left his father’s body</p>

<b>CANTERBURY</b>
<p>You wouldn’t have expected it based on how he acted as a youth. But no sooner had his father stopped breathing than the prince’s wildness died too. Really, at that precise moment he gained a capacity for reflection, which appeared like an angel to chase away the sinful part of him, leaving his body like a paradise, fit to house only lofty thoughts and feelings. You never saw anyone become serious and studious so quickly. You never saw such a total transformation, as though a wild river, rushing through, had swept away his faults. Such a collection of stubborn character flaws was never banished from one place so suddenly as in the case of this king.</p>

<p>List his discourse of war, and you shall hear</p>
<p>A fearful battle rendered you in music.</p>

<p>The Gordian knot of it he will unloose</p>

<p>The air, a chartered libertine, is still,</p>

<p>To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences;</p>
<p>So that the art and practic part of life</p>
<p>Must be the mistress to this theoric;</p>
<p>Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,</p>
<p>Since his addiction was to courses vain,</p>
<p>His companies unlettered, rude, and shallow,</p>
<p>His hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports,</p>
<p>And never noted in him any study,</p>
<p>Any retirement, any sequestration</p>
<p>From open haunts and popularity.</p>

<b>CANTERBURY</b>
<p>If you just listen to him discuss theological matters, you’ll find yourself thinking privately what an excellent bishop he would make. Hear him debate matters of domestic policy, and you’d swear he had made them his constant study. Listen to him talk about war, and you’ll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles. Bring up any political topic, and he’ll untangle it as easily as if it were his own garter. And the result is that when he speaks, the very air—which is free to go where it likes—stops dead, and men stand in silent wonder, hoping to catch the benefit of his gorgeous utterances. There must be skill and experience behind all this abstract thought, but it’s anyone’s guess how he obtained it, since in his youth he preferred shallow pursuits, with uneducated, crude and superficial companions. He spent his time drunken, overfed, and constantly seeking out entertainment, with no inclination for learning or quiet contemplation, nor any limit to his tolerance for public haunts and crowds.</p>

<p>Strawberries grow underneath nettle plants, and berries grow best when they’re planted next to inferior fruit. In the same way, the prince hid his serious side under the guise of wild behavior.

<p>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</p>
<p>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</p>
<p>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</p>
<p>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</p>
<p>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</p>
<p>Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine,</p>
<p>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</p>
<p>Was reunited to the crown of France.</p>
<p>So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun,</p>
<p>King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim,</p>
<p>King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</p>
<p>To hold in right and title of the female.</p>
<p>So do the kings of France unto this day,</p>
<p>Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law</p>
<p>To bar your Highness claiming from the female</p>
<p>And rather choose to hide them in a net</p>
<p>Than amply to imbar their crooked titles</p>
<p>Usurped from you and your progenitors.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>CANTERBURY</b>
<p>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne. There is no legal obstacle to your Highness’ claim to France except the following rule, which the French cite from King Pharamond: <em>In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant</em> (No woman shall inherit property in the Salic land). The French wrongly interpret “the Salic land” to mean France, and they cite Pharamond as the founder of this law that bars female succession to the throne. But their own authors assert that the Salic land is in Germany, between the Sala and the Elbe rivers, where Charles the Great left behind certain French settlements after conquering the Saxons. The French settlers despised the German women because they were unfaithful to their husbands, so the settlers passed this law that no woman should have right of inheritance in Salic land. And the Salic land—the region between the Elbe and the Sala, in Germany, as I said—is now called Meissen. It is clear, then, that the Salic law was not intended for the realm of France. Nor did the French possess the Salic land until four hundred twenty-one years after the death of King Pharamond, incorrectly thought to be the founder of the law. He died in the year 426, and Charles the Great conquered the Saxons and settled Frenchmen in the region beyond the river Sala in the year 805. Besides, according to the French historians, King Pepin, who deposed Childeric, based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild, the daughter of King Clothair. Another case: Hugh Capet, who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine—sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great—passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare, daughter of Charlemagne, who was the son of Lewis the Emperor (who was the son of Charles the Great), in order to give his claim to the throne more validity (though, in fact, the claim was completely false and worthless). Another case: King Lewis the Tenth, who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel, his grandmother, was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare, daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine, by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France. Thus, it should be clear as day that King Pepin’s title, Hugh Capet’s claim, and the resolution of King Lewis’ doubts all plainly derive from the female. To this day, the kings of France follow this unspoken rule, even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line. They prefer to obscure matters rather than reveal how corrupt their own claims to the French crown are. They usurped that crown from you and your ancestors.</p>

</td>

<p>That is why God divided humanity into various functions, so as to keep human endeavor moving ever forward, the one single fixed element—the aim—being obedience. Honey bees operate in just such a communal way. In fact, you can learn a lot about how to run a well-ordered kingdom from these creatures. They have a king and officers of sorts. Some, like magistrates, dole out punishment at home, while others venture forth for commerce, like merchants. Still others, armed like soldiers with stingers, pillage the summer flowers, bringing the booty triumphantly home to the royal tent of their emperor, who is preoccupied with governing. The emperor supervises the masons as they build gold roofs, the ordinary citizens as they process the honey, the humble laborers as they crowd through the city’s narrow gate with their heavy burdens, and the solemn-looking judge (with his grouchy hum) as he delivers lazy, unproductive drones to pale executioners. From this, I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end—just as many arrows, shot from different points, converge on a single target; just as many roads meet in a single town; just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea; just as the many radiuses of a sundial unite at its center. Just so, a thousand actions, once set in motion, will result in one desired object, and all will be well carried out and have a successful end. Therefore, head to France, my liege! Divide your lucky England into four. If you take even one quarter with you to France, you will nevertheless make the whole country shake. If we cannot defend our country with three times such a power left at home, then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation.</p>

Tell him he’s got himself such a willing opponent that we’ll be chasing balls all over France. And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days. He doesn’t realize how useful they were to me. For a long time, I didn’t value this humble throne of England, and therefore lived at some remove and gave myself over to riotous living. Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they’re away from home. But tell the Dauphin I will retain the dignity of kingship and appear all the more royal and glorious on the throne of France. Precisely for this purpose I went about like a commoner and experienced the life of the ordinary man. Now I’ll rise there with such glory that I’ll dazzle all the eyes of France. I’ll shine so brightly that even the Dauphin will be struck blind. And tell the laughing prince that this joke of his has transformed his tennis balls into cannon balls, and the destructive vengeance they bring with them will be his responsibility. His mocking will mock many thousands of widows out of their husbands. It will mock mothers out of their sons, and mock castles down. There are people yet unborn and unconceived who will have reason to curse the Dauphin’s scorn. But all this lies with God, to whom I do appeal. In God’s name, inform the Dauphin I am coming, to avenge myself and to put forth my rightful hand in a sanctified cause. So go in peace.

<b>CHORUS</b>
<p>Now all the youth of England are on fire,</p>
<p>And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.</p>
<p>Now thrive the armorers, and honor’s thought</p>
<p>Reigns solely in the breast of every man.</p>
<p>They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,</p>
<p>Following the mirror of all Christian kings</p>
<p>With wingèd heels, as English Mercurys.</p>
<p>For now sits Expectation in the air</p>
<p>And hides a sword, from hilts unto the point,</p>
<p>With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets</p>
<p>Promised to Harry and his followers.</p>
<p>The French, advised by good intelligence</p>
<p>Of this most dreadful preparation,</p>
<p>Shake in their fear, and with pale policy</p>
<p>Seek to divert the English purposes.</p>
<p>O England, model to thy inward greatness,</p>
<p>Like little body with a mighty heart,</p>
<p>What might’st thou do, that honor would thee do,</p>
<p>Were all thy children kind and natural!</p>
<p>But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out,</p>
<p>A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills</p>
<p>With treacherous crowns, and three corrupted men—</p>
<p>One, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, and the second,</p>
<p>Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland—</p>
<p>Have, for the gilt of France (Oh, guilt indeed!),</p>
<p>Confirmed conspiracy with fearful France,</p>
<p>And by their hands this grace of kings must die,</p>
<p>If hell and treason hold their promises,</p>
<p>Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.</p>
<p>Linger your patience on, and we’ll digest</p>
<p>Th’ abuse of distance, force a play.</p>
<p>The sum is paid, the traitors are agreed,</p>
<p>The king is set from London, and the scene</p>
<p>Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton.</p>
<p>There is the playhouse now, there must you sit,</p>
<p>And thence to France shall we convey you safe</p>
<p>And bring you back, charming the narrow seas</p>
<p>To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,</p>
<p>We’ll not offend one stomach with our play.</p>
<p>But, till the king come forth, and not till then,</p>
<p>Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.</p>

<b>CHORUS</b>
<p>Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet. Armorers are doing great business, and all men think about is honor. People are selling off their land to buy warhorses so they can follow the exemplary king into battle as if they had winged feet, like Mercury. There’s a sense of anticipation in the air. In the minds of Harry and his followers, visions of the kingdoms, spoils, and titles to be won eclipse thoughts of actual fighting. The French, meanwhile, have been forewarned of all this preparation by their spies and tremble in fear. They seek to derail the English with cowardly tricks. Oh, England! You are physically small but inwardly great, like a mighty heart enclosed in a small body. There is nothing you couldn’t accomplish if all your subjects were loyal and loving! But, see, the king of France has detected your weak spot: a nest of faithless traitors, whose treachery he has purchased with gold. Three corrupt men—Richard, earl of Cambridge; Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham; and Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland—have agreed to conspire with the French in exchange for money. The gracious king will die by their hands in Southampton before he sets sail for France—if Hell and treason have their way. Stick with us, ladies and gentlemen, and we’ll make a play, conquering space and time. Imagine that the traitors have been paid and made their choice. The king has left London, and the scene now shifts, friends, to Southampton. That’s where you must pretend the theater is; that’s where you must sit. From there we’ll safely carry you to France and back, calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage. For if we can help it, we’d just as soon nobody was made sick by our play. But we won’t shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears.</p>

<p>The mercy that was quick in us but late</p>

<p>As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.</p>
<p>—See you, my princes and my noble peers,</p>
<p>These English monsters. My Lord of Cambridge here,</p>
<p>You know how apt our love was to accord</p>
<p>To furnish him with all appurtenants</p>
<p>Belonging to his honor, and this man</p>
<p>Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,</p>
<p>And sworn unto the practices of France,</p>
<p>To kill us here in Hampton; to the which</p>
<p>This knight, no less for bounty bound to us</p>
<p>Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn.—But Oh,</p>
<p>What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop, thou cruel,</p>
<p>Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature?</p>
<p>Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,</p>
<p>That knew’st the very bottom of my soul,</p>
<p>That almost mightst have coined me into gold,</p>
<p>Wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use—</p>
<p>May it be possible that foreign hire</p>
<p>Could out of thee extract one spark of evil</p>
<p>That might annoy my finger? ’Tis so strange</p>
<p>That, though the truth of it stands off as gross</p>
<p>As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.</p>
<p>Treason and murder ever kept together</p>
<p>As two yoke-devils sworn to either’s purpose,</p>
<p>Working so grossly in a natural cause</p>
<p>That admiration did not whoop at them.</p>
<p>But thou, ’gainst all proportion, didst bring in</p>
<p>Wonder to wait on treason and on murder,</p>
<p>And whatsoever cunning fiend it was</p>
<p>That wrought upon thee so preposterously</p>
<p>Hath got the voice in hell for excellence.</p>
<p>All other devils that suggest by treasons</p>
<p>Do botch and bungle up damnation</p>
<p>With patches, colors, and with forms being fetched</p>
<p>From glist’ring semblances of piety.</p>
<p>But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up,</p>
<p>Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,</p>
<p>Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.</p>
<p>If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus</p>
<p>Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,</p>
<p>He might return to vasty Tartar back</p>
<p>And tell the legions “I can never win</p>
<p>A soul so easy as that Englishman’s.”</p>
<p>Oh, how hast thou with jealousy infected</p>
<p>The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?</p>
<p>Why, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learnèd?</p>
<p>Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?</p>
<p>Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious?</p>
<p>Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,</p>
<p>Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,</p>
<p>Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,</p>
<p>Garnished and decked in modest complement,</p>
<p>Not working with the eye without the ear,</p>
<p>And but in purgèd judgment trusting neither?</p>
<p>Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem.</p>
<p>And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot</p>
<p>To mark the full-fraught man and best endued</p>
<p>With some suspicion. I will weep for thee,</p>
<p>For this revolt of thine methinks is like</p>
<p>Another fall of man.—Their faults are open.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>KING HENRY</b>
<p>The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice. For shame, don’t talk of mercy. Your own arguments turn against you, like dogs who bite their own masters.—Princes and noble peers, take a look at these English monsters. Cambridge here, you know how I favored him and treated him with every respect due his rank. He was bought for a few coins, entering easily into this conspiracy with the French, promising to kill me here in Southhampton. And this knight, whom I’ve treated as generously as I have Cambridge, also joined the plot. But, oh, what can I say to you, Lord Scroop? You cruel, ungrateful, savage, and inhuman creature! You who had access to all my thoughts, who knew me to the inmost part of my soul, who could have had any amount of gold from me if you’d needed it and only asked me: is it possible that a foreign power could find in you even enough evil to injure one of my fingers? Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white, I can scarcely believe it, it’s so past understanding. Treason and murder have always gone together, like two devils joined in a common purpose. That’s natural. But you, against all reason, added something new to the equation. You added the sheer improbability that you could do this. Whatever fiend it was that seduced you must win the prize for excellence in hell. All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive, put together from shreds and patches of righteousness. But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor. The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion, could return to hell and tell the devil’s legions, “I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman’s.” How you have poisoned my faith in people! Now I am suspicious of everyone. Are there men who appear dutiful? Why, so did you. Are there those who seem serious and knowledgeable? Why, so did you. Do they come from good families? Why, so did you. Do they seem religious? Why, so did you. Do they live in moderation, free from excessive emotion—stable rather than changing their minds constantly—tastefully dressed, not merely seeing but also listening, and trusting no impression without confirmation? That’s how sound a man you appeared. Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion. You have broken my heart. This treachery of yours is like the second Fall of man.—Their crimes are revealed. Arrest and punish them according to the law, and may God pardon them for what they would have done.</p>

<b>DAUPHIN</b>
<p>My most feared father, it is certainly appropriate for us to arm ourselves against the enemy, because even in peace time, when no war or conflict is at hand, a kingdom should not lose its edge, but always be ready—with defenses, men, and training—as though it expected a war. Therefore, I agree that we should all go and inspect those French territories that are weak. Let’s do it with no show of anxiety—no, with no more fear than if we’d heard that the English were busying themselves with folk dancing. Because, my good king, England is so poorly led, her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain, silly, shallow, impulsive youth, that she’s hardly a threat.</p>

<b>KING OF FRANCE</b>
<p>I think King Harry is strong, so the rest of you princes make sure to arm yourselves to meet him with strength. His ancestors got their first taste of blood in battle with us, and he is born of that warlike strain that haunted us on our home ground. Reflect on the battle of Crécy, where, to our everlasting shame, all our princes were taken prisoner by the Prince of Wales, he whom they called Edward the Black Prince. Remember how his mountain-bred father, standing high on a mountain, crowned by the golden sun, observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature, French youth whose fathers and God had nurtured for twenty years, since they were babies. This king is a branch of that same victorious stock. So let us be wary both of his inborn might and of his destiny.</p>

Imagine that you have seen the well-equipped king at Dover pier set sail in full royal regalia and his noble fleet fan the rising sun with its silken banners. Give your imagination free rein. Picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging. Hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub. Picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea, breasting the high waves. Pretend that you’re standing on the shore, watching a city dance on the shifting waves, and you’ll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for Harfleur. Follow it, follow it! Hitch your minds to this navy’s sterns and leave your England, silent as midnight, guarded by grandfathers, babies, and old women. For what male subject is there old enough for his chin to be graced with even one hair who doesn’t want to follow this select band of hand-picked knights to France? Once there, make your thoughts work harder, and witness a siege. Take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of Harfleur. Imagine the French ambassador returning to inform Harry that the king offers him his daughter, Katherine, with some insignificant, unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry. The offer doesn’t go over well, and the nimble gunner now moves to ignite the devilish canon.</p>

<b>KING HENRY</b>
<p>Attack the breach in the city wall once more, dear friends, attack it once more—or else let’s close it up with English corpses. In peacetime, nothing looks better in a man than restraint and humility. But when the battle trumpet blows in our ears, then it’s time to act like the tiger. With muscles taut and blood stirred up, hide your civilized nature under the guise of ugly rage. Lend your eyes a terrifying gleam and let them jut out from the portholes of the head like brass cannon. Make your brow jut out over your eyes like a frightening cliff over the wild and desolate ocean. Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare. Take a deep breath and draw on every impulse to its fullest strength. On, on, you noblest Englishmen, descended as you are from battle-tested fathers, fathers who, like so many Alexander the Greats, have fought in these regions from morning until night, sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight. Don’t dishonor your mothers! Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you. Serve as an example to men of common birth and teach them how to fight. And you, good farmers, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the vigor of your upbringing. Prove you are worthy of your birth, which I do not doubt for a moment. For there isn’t one of you so low-born that your eyes don’t shine with noble luster. I see you’re standing like greyhounds on a leash, straining for the moment when you’ll be let loose. The hunt is on! Follow your spirit, and as you charge cry, “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”</p>

<b>BOY</b>
<p>As young as I am, I have observed these three swashers. I am boy to them all three, but all they three, though they would serve me, could not be man to me. For indeed three such antics do not amount to a man: for Bardolph, he is white-livered and red-faced, by the means whereof he faces it out but fights not; for Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword, by the means whereof he breaks words and keeps whole weapons; for Nym, he hath heard that men of few words are the best men, and therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest he should be thought a coward, but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds, for he never broke any man’s head but his own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal anything and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for three halfpence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a fire shovel. I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals. They would have me as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers, which makes much against my manhood, if I should take from another’s pocket to put into mine, for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them and seek some better service. Their villainy goes against my weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.</p>

<b>BOY</b>
<p>Young though I am, I’ve been observing these three blowhards closely. I am “man”—which is to say, servant—to all three of them. Yet not one among them, if all three were to wait on me, could be my “man,” because three such fakes don’t amount to a man. Take Bardolph: he is cowardly and blustery. He acts tough, but he doesn’t fight. Pistol, meanwhile, has a lethal tongue but an inert sword. He destroys words but keeps his weapon in one piece. As for Nym, he’s heard men of valor are men of few words, so he refuses to pray lest he should be thought a coward. But he has as few good deeds as he has bad words—for he never cracked anyone’s head but his own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal anything and call it spoils. Bardolph stole a lute case, carried it for thirty-six miles, and sold it for a penny and a half. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in crime, and in Calais they stole a fire shovel: I could see from that that they had no pride. They would like me to be as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves and handkerchiefs, which goes against my manhood, because to take something from another’s pocket and put it into my own is plain stealing. I must leave them and seek some better employment. Their villainy nauseates me, and I must therefore vomit it up.</p>

<p>What has the governor of the town decided? This is the final discussion I will grant. So submit to my mercy or, like men who revel in their own destruction, challenge me to do my worst. For, as I am a soldier, the name I think suits me best, once I begin my attack on Harfleur again, I will not leave the half-conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes. The gates of mercy will be closed by then, and harsh and hard-hearted soldiers, who have tasted blood, will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want, mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants. What will it matter to me, since you will have brought it on yourselves, if sacrilegious war, dressed in red like Satan, his face blackened by smoke, should commit every form of savage destruction and ruin? What will it matter to me if your innocent maidens are raped, since you will have asked for it? What power can rein in promiscuous evil once it’s gotten rolling? We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting. Therefore, you men of Harfleur, take pity on your town and on your people while I still have control over my men, while the cool and moderate winds of mercy still have power to disperse the depraved, infected clouds of murder, plunder, and crazed soldiers defile your shrieking daughters with their foul hands, and your fathers dragged by their silver beards, their reverend heads dashed against the walls. Expect to see your naked babies skewered upon pikes while their grief-crazed mothers tear the clouds with their loud cries, just as the women of Judea did when Herod slaughtered their infants.

And she is depicted with a wheel to signify—this is the point—that she is turning and inconstant, and all about change and variation. And her foot, see, is planted on a spherical stone that rolls and rolls and rolls. Truly, artists do wonderful things with the image of Fortune. She provides an excellent moral.</p>

<b>PISTOL</b>
<p>Fortune is Bardolph’s enemy. She frowns on him, for he has stolen a pax from a church and he must be hanged. A damnable death! It’s fine for dogs to be hung, but men should go free and not have their windpipes strangled with hemp. But Exeter has pronounced a death sentence—and for a cheap little pax. Therefore, go and speak for him! The duke will listen to you. Don’t let Bardolph’s life be brought to an end by a length of cheap rope and with this shame. Save his life, Captain, and I will repay you.</p>

<p>Why, ’tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier. And such fellows are perfect in the great commanders’ names, and they will learn you by rote where services were done—at such and such a sconce, at such a breach, at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on. And this they con perfectly in the phrase of war, which they trick up with new-tuned oaths; and what a beard of the general’s cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to be thought on.

<p>Why, he’s a fool, an idiot, a moron, a man who now and then joins the army so as to be able to give himself airs when he gets back to London and masquerades as a soldier. Such fellows have memorized the names of famous commanders, and they can tell you—having learned such things by rote, not by experience—where this or that battle was fought, at such and such fort, at such and such wall, with such and such protective escort. And they can say who fought well, who was shot, who was disgraced, what terms the enemy insisted on. And they study how to express these things in proper military jargon, which they embellish with fashionable oaths. And what a beard trimmed like the general’s or a rough uniform will do among foaming mugs and brains washed with ale, you wouldn’t believe.

<p>Thus says my king: “Say thou to Harry of England, though we seemed dead, we did but sleep. Advantage is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe. Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial. England shall repent his folly, see his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider of his ransom, which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have digested, which, in weight to reanswer, his pettiness would bow under. For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for th’ effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person, kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction. To this, add defiance, and tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation is pronounced.” So far my king and master; so much my office.</p>

<p>My king says this: “Tell Harry of England: though we appeared dead, we were only asleep. Strategy makes a better soldier than haste. Tell him we could have driven him back at Harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened. Now the time is right for us to speak, and we do so with imperial authority. The king of England will regret his foolishness, discover his weakness, and marvel at our restraint. Tell him therefore to consider what ransom he can offer as a prisoner of war. It must be commensurate with the losses we have suffered, the subjects we have lost, and the indignity we have endured, for which he is too insignificant to sufficiently pay us back. His coffers are too poor to atone for our losses, his entire kingdom too small to account for the amount of blood we’ve shed, and the sight of him kneeling at our feet an empty satisfaction compared to the indignity we have put up with. Add defiance to all this and, by way of conclusion, tell him that he has betrayed the men who follow him, whose death sentence has been pronounced.” My king and master’s message delivered, my task is done.</p>

But God forgive me for bragging. It’s a vice I’ve picked up since I’ve been here, and I must get rid of it. Anyway, go tell your master I am here. My ransom is my own fragile, worthless body, my army but a weak and sickly escort. But, before God, tell him we will advance, even if the king of France himself and another foe as strong should stand in our way. <em>(giving him money)</em> That’s for your trouble, Montjoy. Go tell your master to consider carefully. If we’re allowed to pass, we will. If we’re prevented, we’ll discolor your golden ground with your red blood. And so, Montjoy, farewell.

<p>Now entertain conjecture of a time</p>

<p>The hum of either army stilly sounds,</p>
<p>That the fixed sentinels almost receive</p>
<p>The secret whispers of each other’s watch.</p>
<p>Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames</p>
<p>Each battle sees the other’s umbered face.</p>
<p>Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs</p>
<p>Piercing the night’s dull ear; and from the tents</p>
<p>The armorers, accomplishing the knights,</p>
<p>With busy hammers closing rivets up,</p>
<p>Give dreadful note of preparation.</p>
<p>The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,</p>
<p>And, the third hour of drowsy morning named,</p>
<p>Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,</p>
<p>The confident and overlusty French</p>
<p>Do the low-rated English play at dice</p>
<p>And chide the cripple, tardy-gaited night,</p>
<p>Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp</p>
<p>So tediously away. The poor condemnèd English,</p>
<p>Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires</p>
<p>Sit patiently and inly ruminate</p>
<p>The morning’s danger; and their gesture sad,</p>
<p>Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats,</p>
<p>Presenteth them unto the gazing moon</p>
<p>So many horrid ghosts. Oh, now, who will behold</p>
<p>The royal captain of this ruined band</p>
<p>Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent?</p>
<p>Let him cry, “Praise and glory on his head!”</p>
<p>For forth he goes and visits all his host,</p>
<p>Bids them good morrow with a modest smile,</p>
<p>And calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen.</p>
<p>Upon his royal face there is no note</p>
<p>How dread an army hath enrounded him,</p>
<p>Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color</p>
<p>Unto the weary and all-watchèd night,</p>
<p>But freshly looks and overbears attaint</p>
<p>With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty,</p>
<p>That every wretch, pining and pale before,</p>
<p>Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks.</p>
<p>A largess universal, like the sun,</p>
<p>His liberal eye doth give to everyone,</p>
<p>Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all</p>
<p>Behold, as may unworthiness define,</p>
<p>A little touch of Harry in the night.</p>
<p>And so our scene must to the battle fly,</p>
<p>Where, Oh, for pity, we shall much disgrace,</p>
<p>With four or five most vile and ragged foils</p>
<p>Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,</p>
<p>The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,</p>
<p>Minding true things by what their mock’ries be.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>CHORUS</b>
<p>Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe. From camp to camp through the dark cave of night, the noise from both armies grows so quiet that those standing watch almost think they can hear the whispered secrets of one another’s sentinels. One by one, fires are lit on both sides, and through their pale flames, each army thinks he sees the smoke-tinged faces of the other. The horses of each army answer one another’s proud, threatening neighs as they pierce the dull night, and from the tents the sound of the blacksmiths’ hammers as they fit out the knights, closing rivets up, adds a note of fear to the preparations. The country cocks crow and the clocks toll, sounding a drowsy three o’clock in the morning. Proud of their army and secure in their numbers, the confident and overeager French play dice, betting on how many worthless Englishmen each will capture. They scold the limping, slowly moving night, which, like an ugly old woman, takes so long to pass. The poor doomed English, like sacrificial beasts, sit patiently, and privately contemplate the dangers that will arrive with morning. With their grave faces, emaciated cheeks, and war-torn coats, they seem to the gazing moon like so many horrifying ghosts. Now, whoever spots the royal captain of this ruined army walking from camp to camp, from tent to tent, let him cry “Praise and glory on his head!” For out he goes visiting all his troops. He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen. There is no indication of the mighty army that surrounds them in his expression, nor has the long, sleepless night robbed his face of an ounce of color. Instead, he looks fresh and covers any signs of fatigue with a show of cheerfulness and sweet majesty that every sad and pale wretch takes comfort in when they see him. His generous eye notices everyone, doling out a bounty as far-reaching as the sun, thawing cold fear, so that low and well-born alike may all experience (for want of a better way of putting it) a little touch of Harry in the night. With that, our scene rushes on toward the battle, which we will represent with four or five worn-out fencing foils, a travesty of battle—forgive us!—that disgraces the name of Agincourt. Still, stay to watch, imagining the way it really was from our own inadequate imitation.</p>

<p>No. Nor it is not meet he should, for, though I speak it to you, I think the king is but a man as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to me. The element shows to him as it doth to me. All his senses have but human conditions. His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man, and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing. Therefore, when he sees reason of fears as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are. Yet, in reason, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.</p>

<p>No, nor would it be right for him to. Though it’s not my place to say so, I think the king is, after all, only a man, the same as me. The violet smells to him the same as it does to me. The sky appears to him much as it does to me, and all his senses are those of a mortal man. Without his fine clothes, the king appears just like any other naked man. And though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours, when they plummet, they plummet that much farther. Therefore, when he has reason to fear, as we do, his fears are without question of the same order. Still, it stands to reason that he mustn’t betray his fear, as it might dishearten his army.</p>

I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle, for how can they charitably dispose of anything, when blood is their argument?

I think few die well who die in battle. How can a person expect to resolve anything in a Christian manner when they’ve passed their lives killing? Now, if these men don’t die in a state of grace, it will be a heavy charge against the king who led them into battle, whom they, as his subjects, could not disobey.</p>

<b>KING HENRY</b>
<p>So, if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon his father that sent him. Or if a servant, under his master’s command transporting a sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the business of the master the author of the servant’s damnation. But this is not so. The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant, for they purpose not their death, when they purpose their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrament of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers. Some, peradventure, have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God. War is His beadle, war is His vengeance, so that here men are punished for before-breach of the king’s laws in now the king’s quarrel. Where they feared the death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish. Then, if they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited. Every subject’s duty is the king’s, but every subject’s soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed: wash every mote out of his conscience. And, dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained. And in him that escapes, it were not sin to think that, making God so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>KING HENRY</b>
<p>The king isn’t responsible for the particular end each soldier comes to, nor is the father responsible for his son’s final end or the master for his servant’s. The father and the master and the king didn’t order their subordinates’ deaths when they ordered their services. Besides, there’s no king, however pure his cause, who, if it comes to a trial by combat, can rely on using completely blameless soldiers. Perhaps some may be guilty of plotting murder, some of seducing maidens with lies and then abandoning them; some, of looting and stealing before they were even hired as soldiers. Even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home, they cannot escape God. War is God’s agent of justice. War is vengeance. So there are men here who have broken the king’s law earlier and are punished now in his war. When they feared death, they escaped with their lives; and now where they imagine they’re safe, they perish. So, if they die unprepared, the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes they’re finally being punished for. Every subject’s duty is the king’s, but every subject’s soul is his own. Therefore, every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do: clear his conscience of any stain. Then if he dies, his death serves him. Or, if he doesn’t die, the time he spent preparing himself was at least blessed. And in the case of the man who survives, one could be forgiven for supposing that God spared him exactly because he was so ready to die; now he can live to appreciate God’s greatness and teach others to prepare.By this reasoning, if a son is sent by his father on business and drowns at sea while still in a state of sin, his wickedness is his father’s fault. Or if a servant, carrying a sum of money for his master, is attacked by robbers and dies without confessing his sins, we can say that the master’s business is to blame for the servant’s damnation. But that isn’t so.</p>

<p>Upon the king! “Let’s lay everything upon the king: our lives, our souls, our debts, our anxious wives, our children, and our sins.” I must bear responsibility for all of it. What a painful condition responsibility is. It goes along with being born to greatness, but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about. What infinite peace do king’s give up that private men enjoy? What do kings have that private men do not, besides the pomp of their position? And what is this useless ceremony of kings? What kind of god is ceremony, which suffers more than its worshippers do? What income, what profit does it bring in? Oh, ceremony, only show me your value! Why are you adored? Do you amount to anything besides position, status, and ritual, which inspire awe and fear in others? You’re less happy, being feared, than they are in fearing you. What do you get to drink, instead of sweet obedience, but poisonous flattery? Try being sick, great greatness, and see if ceremony can cure you! Do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles? Will it be chased away by bowing and scraping? You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee, but can you take possession of his health? No, vain illusion, so intricately bound up with a king’s rest. I who understand you, gorgeous ceremony, because I’m a king and I know that neither the balm, the scepter, and the ball, the robe layered in gold and pearls, the fancy title that precedes the king, the throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world —not all of these put together, not all of these laid down at night in an imperial bed, can cause the king to rest so soundly as does the miserable wretch who turns in at night with a full stomach and an empty mind, fed on the bread of his daily struggle. He never wakes to horrifying darkness, born of hell, but sweats in the hot sun from dawn to</p>

Let’s blow on them. The breath of our valor will send them sprawling. There’s no question, lords, but that those extra servants and peasants swarming uselessly around our battle formations would be sufficient to rid this field of such a good-for-nothing foe, while we ourselves stood at the base of this mountain idly looking on. But our honor wouldn’t stand for that. What’s there to say? Doing the very least will do the whole job. Let the trumpets sound the signal to mount up and march.

<p>Who wishes that? My cousin Westmoreland? No, my dear cousin. If we are slated to die, the fewer, the better for our country, and if we’re slated to live, the fewer men, the greater the share of honor for each of us. In God’s name, I beg you not to wish for one more man. By God, I am not selfish when it comes to money: I don’t care who eats at my expense. It doesn’t bother me when people borrow my clothing—I don’t care about these concrete things. But if it is a sin to be selfish about honor, I am the most guilty soul alive. No, my cousin, don’t wish that even one man who is now in England were here instead. By God, I wouldn’t lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me, I think—not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory. Oh, do not wish one more! Instead, make this known throughout the army: whoever has no spirit for this fight, let him depart. He will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home. We would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us. This day is called the Feast of Saint Crispian: he who lives to see this day out and comes home safe will stand tall when this day is named and raise himself up at the mention of Crispian. He who survives this day and lives to see old age shall yearly entertain his neighbors on the eve, saying, “Tomorrow is Saint Crispin’s Day.” He’ll roll up his sleeve and show his scars, saying, “I got these wounds on St. Crispin’s Day.” Old men forget. But these men will remember every detail of what they did today long after they’ve forgotten everything else. And as the wine flows, our names, familiar as household words, will be invoked again: Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter, Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester. Good men will tell their sons this story and the Feast of St. Crispin will never go by, from this day to the end of time, without our being remembered: we few, we happy few, we band of brothers—for whoever sheds his blood with me today shall be my brother. However humble his birth, this day shall grant him nobility. And men back in English now safe in their beds will curse themselves for not having been here, and think less of their own manhood when they listen to the stories of those who fought with us here on St. Crispin’s Day.</p>

<p>While the beast lived was killed with hunting him.</p>

<b>KING HENRY</b>
<p>Be good enough to take back the same answer I gave before. Tell them to capture me, then sell my bones. Good God! Why do they mock poor fellows this way? The man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him. A good many of our bodies, I imagine, will end up in English soil. And on their graves, I trust, the story of this day’s work will be written in brass. And those who leave their valiant bones in France, dying like men though buried in your dunghills—they’ll be remembered, too. The sun will rise on them here and draw their glory up to heaven, leaving their mortal remains to choke your land: the smell of rotting flesh will breed a plague in France. Then will you notice the abundant valor of our Englishmen, who will embark on a second round of mischief like a ricocheting bullet, killing again as they fall to their deaths. Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable we’re only workaday soldiers. Our finery and shining metal are all rusty from long, painful marches in the rain. There’s not a strand of feather left in our whole army—a good sign, I hope, that we won’t fly away like birds—and time on the field has made us slovenly. But, by God, our hearts are in good shape. And my poor soldiers tell me that before night they’ll be in cleaner clothes. If not, they’ll pull the bright new coats of the French over their heads and send them on their way. If they do this, as they will, God willing, my ransom will soon be raised. Herald, spare yourself. Don’t come again to ask for my ransom, good messenger. I swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine. And if the French get them in the state in which I intend to leave them, they won’t be worth much use to anyone. Tell the constable that.</p>

<p>Larding the plain, and by his bloody side,</p>

<p>The noble earl of Suffolk also lies.</p>

<p>Tarry, sweet soul, for mine; then fly abreast,</p>

<p>He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,</p>
<p>And with a feeble grip, says “Dear my lord,</p>
<p>Commend my service to my sovereign.”</p>
<p>So did he turn, and over Suffolk’s neck</p>
<p>He threw his wounded arm and kissed his lips,</p>
<p>And so, espoused to death, with blood he sealed</p>
<p>A testament of noble-ending love.</p>
<p>The pretty and sweet manner of it forced</p>

<p>The valiant soldier is still dressed like that, lying on the ground, drenching the field with his blood. By his side lies the noble earl of Suffolk, York’s comrade and equal in brave wounds. Suffolk died first, and York, cut to pieces, came to him where he lay in his blood and took him by the face, kissing his gashes. He cried out, “Wait for me, dear cousin. My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven. Wait for mine, sweet soul. We’ll fly there side by side, just as we stood together as brother-knights in this glorious and well-fought battle!” At this, I went to comfort him. He smiled at me close, gave me his hand, gripping me feebly, and said, “My dear lord, commend my service to my king.” With that, he turned and threw his wounded arm around Suffolk’s neck and kissed his lips. And so, married to death, he sealed a testament of love that even ended in nobility. The fineness of the moment moved me to tears. I tried to hold them back, but wept like a mother.</p>

<p>I think that Macedon is indeed where Alexander was born. I tell you, Captain, if you look at a map of the world, I’ll bet you will find, comparing Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, see, are very similar. There is a river in Macedon, and there is likewise a river in Monmouth. The river in Monmouth is called Wye, but the name of the other river has gone out of my head. Nevertheless, it’s all one—the two rivers are as alike as my fingers are to my fingers, and there are salmon in both. If you look closely at Alexander’s life, Harry of Monmouth’s stands up fairly well by comparison—for there are analogies in everything. Alexander, God knows and you know, in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his angers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations, and also being a little the worse for drink, killed his best friend Cleitus in a drunken rage, see.</p>

<p>My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester, follow Fluellen at a close distance. The glove which I have given him to wear may possibly win him a box on the ear. It belongs to the soldier I was just talking to. According to an agreement, I should wear it myself. Follow Fluellen, cousin Warwick, and if the soldier strikes him—and I would think from his forthright manner that he’ll keep his word—some mischief may arise as a result.

<p>Toward Calais. Grant him there. There seen,</p>
<p>Heave him away upon your wingèd thoughts</p>
<p>Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach</p>
<p>Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,</p>
<p>Whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep-mouthed sea,</p>
<p>Which like a mighty whiffler ’fore the king</p>
<p>Seems to prepare his way. So let him land,</p>
<p>And solemnly see him set on to London.</p>
<p>So swift a pace hath thought that even now</p>
<p>You may imagine him upon Blackheath,</p>
<p>Where that his lords desire him to have borne</p>
<p>His bruisèd helmet and his bended sword</p>
<p>Before him through the city. He forbids it,</p>
<p>Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride,</p>
<p>Giving full trophy, signal, and ostent</p>
<p>Quite from himself, to God. But now behold,</p>
<p>In the quick forge and workinghouse of thought,</p>
<p>How London doth pour out her citizens.</p>
<p>The Mayor and all his brethren in best sort,</p>
<p>Like to the senators of th’ antique Rome,</p>
<p>With the plebeians swarming at their heels,</p>
<p>Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in—</p>
<p>As, by a lower but loving likelihood,</p>
<p>Were now the general of our gracious empress,</p>
<p>As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,</p>
<p>Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,</p>
<p>How many would the peaceful city quit</p>
<p>To welcome him! Much more, and much more cause,</p>
<p>Did they this Harry. Now in London place him</p>
<p>(As yet the lamentation of the French</p>
<p>Invites the king of England’s stay at home;</p>
<p>The emperor’s coming in behalf of France</p>
<p>To order peace between them) and omit</p>
<p>All the occurrences, whatever chanced,</p>
<p>Till Harry’s back return again to France.</p>
<p>There must we bring him, and myself have played</p>
<p>The interim, by remembering you ’tis past.</p>
<p>Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance</p>

<b>CHORUS</b>
<p>Allow me to fill in the gaps for those of you who have not read this story. As for those who have, I beg you to excuse the gaps in time, and the many people and things that cannot be represented here in all their magnitude and proper form. Let’s bring the king now to Calais. Imagine him there and, having seen him there, haul him back across the sea on the wings of your imagination. There’s the coast of England: see how the sea seems to be fenced in by the men and wives and boys who line the shore, their shouts and wild applause drowning out the deep roar of the surf. As the king’s ship draws near, the very ocean is like a man running before the king, preparing his way. Let’s have him land and solemnly proceed to London. Thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on Blackheath, where his lords suggest that he should carry his battle-scarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city. He refuses, as he is free of vanity and self-serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to God. Now in the factory of thought, create the image of all London pouring forth into the streets. Picture the mayor and all his brother citizens dressed in their best as they go forth like senators of ancient Rome to welcome home their conquering Caesar. Imagine if our own queen’s general returned from Ireland, having stamped out the rebellion there, as we hope he does very soon, how many people would leave the city to come welcome him. Even more people than that welcomed Harry home, and they had even more reason. Let’s put him now in London, since France’s period of mourning requires the king of England to stay home. Imagine a visit of the Holy Roman Emperor, working on France’s behalf. He wants to bring about a peace between the two countries. Skip over all the particularities between then and Harry’s return to France. There we must place him, and I myself have covered the interim period by reminding you that it has taken place. So, keeping this omission in mind, immediately return to France, your eyes following the path of your thoughts.</p>

The rascally, scald, beggarly, lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and yourself and all the world know to be no petter than a fellow, look you now, of no merits, he is come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday, look you, and bid me eat my leek. It was in place where I could not breed no contention with him, but I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again, and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires.</p>

<p>Dear nurse of arts, plenties, and joyful births,</p>
<p>Should not in this best garden of the world,</p>
<p>Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?</p>
<p>Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,</p>
<p>And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,</p>
<p>Corrupting in its own fertility.</p>
<p>Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,</p>
<p>Unprunèd, dies. Her hedges, even-pleached,</p>
<p>Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,</p>
<p>Put forth disordered twigs. Her fallow leas</p>

<p>Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts</p>
<p>That should deracinate such savagery.</p>

<p>The freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover,</p>
<p>Wanting the scythe, withal uncorrected, rank,</p>
<p>Conceives by idleness, and nothing teems</p>
<p>But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burrs,</p>
<p>Losing both beauty and utility.</p>
<p>And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges,</p>
<p>Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,</p>
<p>Even so our houses and ourselves and children</p>
<p>Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,</p>

<p>But grow like savages, as soldiers will</p>
<p>That nothing do but meditate on blood,</p>
<p>To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire,</p>
<p>And everything that seems unnatural.</p>
<p>Which to reduce into our former favor</p>

<b>BURGUNDY</b>
<p>Great kings of France and England, I owe you both equal service and loyalty. Your Highnesses can both attest to the fact that I’ve strived mightily, with all my wits and energy, to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial Majesties. Since I have succeeded to the point of bringing you face to face and eye to eye, don’t take it ill if I formally demand to know, before this royal congregation, what obstacle or impediment prevents the poor fragile, mangled peace, the mother of arts and joyous births, from showing her lovely face in this most fertile garden of the world, our fair France? Alas, she has been too long exiled from France, whose crops all lie in heaps, rotting with ripeness. Her grapes, which make the wine that cheers our hearts, die unpruned on the vines. Her once-trimmed hedges, like prisoners with wild, untended hair, put forth unruly twigs. Her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds, while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting. The level meadow, where the freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover once grew, has become useless: unmowed, it grows to seed, so that nothing springs up but weeds, rough thistles, barren plants, and burs. And just as our vineyards, fallow fields, meadows, and hedges, which grow improperly if left to themselves, run riot, so our families and ourselves and our children have lost—or no longer have time to learn—skills that should be a credit to our country. They grow like savages—like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood—surrounded by swearing and stern looks, ragged clothing and everything unnatural. It’s to reverse all this, so we can once again become as we were, that you have all been brought together; therefore I demand to know why gentle peace should not banish these troubles and bless us with her former qualities.</p>

<p>The princess is the better Englishwoman.—I’ faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding. I am glad thou canst speak no better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say, “I love you.” Then if you urge me farther than to say, “Do you, in faith?” I wear out my suit. Give me your answer, i’ faith, do; and so clap hands and a bargain. How say you, lady?</p>

<p>How very English of her. Kate, my wooing is fit for your understanding: I am glad your English isn’t better.

I don’t know any fancy ways of talking about love, only to say right out, “I love you.” If you press me any further than with the question, “Do you really?” my love scene is over.

<p>Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake, Kate, why you undid me. For the one, I have neither words nor measure; and for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife. Or if I might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favors, I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes, never off. But, before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation, only downright oaths, which I never use till urged, nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sunburning, that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for this, take me. If not, to say to thee that I shall die is true, but for thy love, by the Lord, no. Yet I love thee too. And while thou liv’st, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy, for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places. For these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies’ favors, they do always reason themselves out again. What? A speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad, a good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black beard will turn white, a curled pate will grow bald, a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow, but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon, for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly. If thou would have such a one, take me. And take me, take a soldier. Take a soldier, take a king. And what say’st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</p>

<b>KING HENRY</b>
<p>Really, if you were thinking of having me write poetry or dance for you, Kate, you’ve defeated me already. I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other, though I have the gift of strength. If I could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back—though you may accuse me of boasting—I could easily get myself a wife. I can fight with my fists and rear my horse up without falling off him, if either of those things could win me love. But, before God, Kate, I cannot turn pale on purpose or gasp out fancy phrases, and I have no gift for clever declarations, only blunt oaths, which I never use till I’m asked and never break no matter who asks me. If you can love a man of this temperament, Kate, whose face a sunburn wouldn’t make any worse and who never looks in the mirror to admire himself, let your eye improve me. I speak to you as a plain soldier. If you can love me for this, take me. If not, to tell you I will die is true, but not for love, by God. And yet I do love you. So take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness. He’s bound to be true to you as he won’t be up to flirting with other women. These chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a lady’s good graces always reason themselves out again. Look, a talker is just a gabber; a poem is just a rhyme. A good leg will shrink, a straight back stoop, a black beard turn white, a curly head grow bald, an attractive face grow wrinkled and a pretty eye hollow. But a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or, rather, the sun, and not the moon, for it goes on shining brightly forever. If you would have such a man, take me. Take me and get a soldier; take a soldier and get a king. So what do you say to my suit? Speak, my fair one, and speak fairly, I beg you.</p>

<p>Take her, my son, and give me children by her, so that the warring kingdoms of France and England, whose very shores have paled in envy at each other’s happiness, may finally end their mutual hostility. May this precious marriage cause friendship and alliance between them and war never again threaten England or fair France with his bloody sword.</p>

<b>CHORUS</b>
<p>Thus far with rough and all-unable pen</p>
<p>Our bending author hath pursued the story,</p>
<p>In little room confining mighty men,</p>
<p>Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.</p>
<p>Small time, but in that small most greatly lived</p>
<p>This star of England. Fortune made his sword,</p>
<p>By which the world’s best garden be achieved</p>
<p>And of it left his son imperial lord.</p>
<p>Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crowned king</p>
<p>Of France and England, did this king succeed,</p>
<p>Whose state so many had the managing</p>
<p>That they lost France and made his England bleed,</p>
<p>Which oft our stage hath shown. And for their sake,</p>
<p>In your fair minds let this acceptance take.</p>

<b>CHORUS</b>
<p>Thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude, inadequate writing, keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled history’s full glory with his uneven telling. The lifespan of our English hero was brief, but in that brief time he achieved greatness. He had good luck as a warrior, and with it he created the world’s greatest garden, France, leaving his son as its imperial ruler. Henry the Sixth, crowned king of France and England while still in his infancy, succeeded him. But so many people had a hand in managing the child’s kingdom that France was lost and civil war came to England—a story we’ve acted out many times on this stage. With those plays in mind, we hope you’ll receive this one kindly.</p>
