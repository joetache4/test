    ms: "PROSPERO enters in his magic robes, with ARIEL."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "Now does my project gather to a head."
      - "My charms crack not, my spirits obey, and time"
      - "Goes upright with his carriage. How’s the day?"
    m:
      - "My plans are almost at their climax. My spells are working well, my spirits are obeying me, and everything is right on schedule. What time is it?"

  - sp: ARIEL
    o:
      - "On the sixth hour, at which time, my lord,"
      - "You said our work should cease."
    m:
      - "It’s after six o’clock, my lord, when you said our work would be finished."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    I did say so"
      - "When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,"
      - "How fares the king and ’s followers?"
    m:
      - "That’s what I said when I first conjured the tempest. Tell me, spirit, how’s the king and his entourage?"

  - sp: ARIEL
    o:
      - "    Confined together"
      - "In the same fashion as you gave in charge,"
      - "Just as you left them, all prisoners, sir,"
      - "In the line grove which weather-fends your cell."
      - "They cannot budge till your release. The king,"
      - "His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,"
      - "And the remainder mourning over them,"
      - "Brimful of sorrow and dismay. But chiefly"
      - "Him that you termed, sir, “the good old Lord Gonzalo,”"
      - "His tears run down his beard like winter’s drops"
      - "From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works ’em"
      - "That if you now beheld them, your affections"
      - "Would become tender."
    m:
      - "All cooped up together, just as you ordered, all imprisoned in the grove of linden trees that protects your room from bad weather. They can’t move till you release them. The king, his brother, and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind, and the rest are grieving over them, sad and astonished. “Good old lord Gonzalo,” as you call him, is saddest of all, with tears running down his beard. Your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now, you’d feel sorry for them."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    Dost thou think so, spirit?"
    m:
      - "Do you think so, spirit?"

  - sp: ARIEL
    o:
      - "Mine would, sir, were I human."
    m:
      - "I’d feel sorry for them, if I were human."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    And mine shall."
      - "Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling"
      - "Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,"
      - "One of their kind, that relish all as sharply"
      - "Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?"
      - "Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th’ quick,"
      - "Yet with my nobler reason ’gainst my fury"
      - "Do I take part. The rarer action is"
      - "In virtue than in vengeance. They being penitent,"
      - "The sole drift of my purpose doth extend"
      - "Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel."
      - "My charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore,"
      - "And they shall be themselves."
    m:
      - "I will too. You’re made of air, so if even you feel sorry for them, imagine the pity that I’ll feel, being one of their own human race. I suffer pain just as much as they do, so I’ll sympathize far more than you. Though I’m indignant about their evil deeds, I’ll go with my nobler instincts, which tell me to feel some compassion for them. It’s better to act virtuously rather than vengefully. Now that they’re sorry, I don’t want anything more. Go release them, Ariel. I’ll break my spells and bring them back to their senses, and they’ll feel like themselves again."

  - sp: ARIEL
    o:
      - "    I’ll fetch them, sir."
    m:
      - "I’ll go get them, sir."

  - os: "Exit ARIEL"

    o:
      - "*(tracing a circle on the ground)*"
      - "Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves,"
      - "And ye that on the sands with printless foot"
      - "Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him"
      - "When he comes back; you demi-puppets that"
      - "By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,"
      - "Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime"
      - "Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice"
      - "To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,"
      - "Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimmed"
      - "The noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds,"
      - "And ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault"
      - "Set roaring war—to th’ dread rattling thunder"
      - "Have I given fire, and rifted Jove’s stout oak"
      - "With his own bolt;"
      - "    the strong-based promontory"
      - "Have I made shake, and by the spurs plucked up"
      - "The pine and cedar; graves at my command"
      - "Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let ’em forth"
      - "By my so potent art. But this rough magic"
      - "I here abjure, and when I have required"
      - "Some heavenly music, which even now I do,"
      - "To work mine end upon their senses that"
      - "This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff,"
      - "Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,"
      - "And deeper than did ever plummet sound"
      - "I’ll drown my book."
    m:
      - "*(drawing a large circle on the stage with his staff)* I’ve darkened the noontime sun with the aid of you elves who live in the hills and brooks and groves, and you who chase the sea on the beach without leaving footprints in the sand, and run away when the waves come back; and you who make toadstools while the moon shines; who make mushrooms as a hobby after the evening bell has rung. With your help I’ve called up the angry winds, and set the green sea and blue sky at war with each other. I’ve given lightning to the thunderclouds, and burned up Jupiter’s beloved oak. With his own lightning bolts; I’ve shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars; I’ve opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them, letting them out with my powerful magic. But I surrender all this magic now, when I’ve summoned some heavenly music to cast a spell, as I’m doing now, I’ll break my staff and bury it far underground, and throw my book of magic spells deeper into the sea than any anchor ever sank."

  - os: "Enter ARIEL before, Then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO—they all enter the circle which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:"
    ms: "ARIEL enters, followed by ALONSO gesturing frantically, accompanied by GONZALO. SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO enter in the same way, accompanied by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO. They all enter the circle that PROSPERO has drawn and stand there under a spell. PROSPERO, watching all of this, speaks, though the others do not hear him."

  - o:
      - "A solemn air and the best comforter"
      - "To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,"
      - "Now useless, boiled within thy skull.—There stand,"

      - "Their clearer reason.—"

      - "Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell."
      - "I will discase me, and myself present"
      - "As I was sometime Milan. Quickly, spirit."
      - "Thou shalt ere long be free."
    m:
      - "Let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds, which are now useless, seething inside your skulls.—All of you stand there in my spell.—*(to GONZALO)* Good Gonzalo, you honorable man, my eyes weep for you, since I feel what you must feel now. *(to himself)* The spell is breaking gradually, and just as dawn creeps in and melts away the darkness, they will slowly return to their senses.—*(to GONZALO)* Oh, my dear Gonzalo, you’re my savior and loyal to your lord, I’ll reward you fully, not just with praise but with actions too.— *(to ALONSO)* You, Alonso, manipulated me and my daughter cruelly, and your brother helped you.—*(to SEBASTIAN)* You’re paying the price for it now, Sebastian.—*(to ANTONIO)* My brother, you were so greedy for power that you forgot natural compassion and our bond as brothers, and were ready to kill your king—I forgive you, though you’re a monster.—*(to himself)* Look at them, they’re starting to understand. Soon their confused minds will clear up. But at this point not a single one of them recognizes me.—*(to ARIEL)* Ariel, get me my hat and sword from my room. I’ll take off the clothes I’m wearing now, and put on the ones I used to wear in Milan.—Soon, spirit, you’ll be free."

  - sp: ALONSO
    o:
      - "    Whe’er thou beest he or no,"
      - "Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,"
      - "As late I have been, I not know. Thy pulse"

      - "Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero"
      - "Be living and be here?"
    m:
      - "Whether you’re really him or whether this is some magic trick like I was recently subjected to, I don’t know. Your heart beats like you were real, and ever since I saw you, I feel my mind becoming sane again, released from its earlier insanity. There must be a strange explanation for this—if it’s true. I surrender your dukedom and beg you to forgive me all my crimes. But how is it possible that Prospero’s alive and well and living on this island?"

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "*(to GONZALO)*    First, noble friend,"
      - "Let me embrace thine age, whose honor cannot"

      - "But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,"
      - "I here could pluck his highness’ frown upon you"
      - "And justify you traitors. At this time"
      - "I will tell no tales."
    m:
      - "You’re still experiencing some of the little quirks of this island, which makes so many things seem uncertain. Welcome, my friends. *(speaking so that only SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO can hear)* But you two lords, if I felt like it, I could turn you in as the traitors you are. But as for now, I won’t say a word."

  - sp: SEBASTIAN
    o:

      - "Thy rankest fault, all of them, and require"
      - "My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,"
      - "Thou must restore."
    m:
      - "No.—*(to ANTONIO)* As for you, you evil man that I can’t even call brother, I forgive you for even your worst sin, all your sins. I demand my dukedom back from you, which I know you have to give me."

    m:
      - "If you’re Prospero, give us the details of how you were saved, how you met us here, when we were just shipwrecked here three hours ago, when I lost—How painful the memory is!—my dear son Ferdinand"

  - sp: ALONSO
    o:
      - "Irreparable is the loss, and patience"
      - "Says it is past her cure."
    m:
      - "No one can undo this loss of mine, and trying to endure it patiently doesn’t help."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    I rather think"
      - "You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace"
      - "For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,"
      - "And rest myself content."
    m:
      - "I don’t think you’ve tried to endure it. Being patient has helped me a lot, for I have suffered a loss similar to yours."

  - sp: ALONSO
    o:
      - "    You the like loss?"
    m:
      - "You suffered a loss like mine?"

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "As great to me as late. And supportable"
      - "To make the dear loss have I means much weaker"
      - "Than you may call to comfort you, for I"
      - "Have lost my daughter."
    m:
      - "Yes, just as great and just as recent. And I have much less to comfort me than you do, since I’ve lost my daughter."

  - sp: ALONSO
    o:
      - "    A daughter?"
      - "O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,"
      - "The king and queen there! That they were, I wish"
      - "Myself were mudded in that oozy bed"
      - "Where my son lies.—When did you lose your daughter?"
    m:
      - "A daughter? Oh God, I wish the two of them were alive and living in Naples, as king and queen! I’d give up my life and take my son’s place in the mud on the ocean floor if I could see them alive in Naples.—When did you lose your daughter?"

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "In this last tempest. I perceive these lords"
      - "At this encounter do so much admire"
      - "That they devour their reason and scarce think"
      - "Their eyes do offices of truth, their words"
      - "Are natural breath.—But howsoev’r you have"
      - "Been justled from your senses, know for certain"
      - "That I am Prospero and that very duke"
      - "Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely"
      - "Upon this shore where you were wracked, was landed,"
      - "To be the lord on ’t."
      - "    No more yet of this,"
      - "For ’tis a chronicle of day by day,"
      - "Not a relation for a breakfast, nor"
      - "Befitting this first meeting."
      - "*(to ALONSO)*  Welcome, sir."
      - "This cell’s my court. Here have I few attendants"
      - "And subjects none abroad. Pray you, look in."
      - "My dukedom since you have given me again,"
      - "I will requite you with as good a thing,"
      - "At least bring forth a wonder to content ye"
      - "As much as me my dukedom."
    m:
      - "In this recent storm. These lords seem so astonished that they’ve lost their use of reason and can hardly believe what they see with their own eyes.—But whatever the reason for your losing your senses, you can know for sure that I’m Prospero, that same duke who was kicked out of Milan and landed on this same island where you landed, and became the lord of it. No more of this story now, for it takes days to tell, not just a chat over breakfast or during this first meeting of ours. *(to ALONSO)* Welcome, sir. This room’s my royal court. I have hardly any servants and no subjects outside this room. Please, have a look. Since you’ve given my dukedom back to me, I’ll give you something equally nice, or at least I’ll give you an amazement to satisfy you as much as my dukedom satisfies me."
