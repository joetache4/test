<b>PROTEUS</b>
<p>You have prevailed, my lord. If I can do it</p>
<p>By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,</p>

<p>But say this weed her love from Valentine,</p>
<p>It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.</p>

<b>PROTEUS</b>
<p>You’ve convinced me, my lord. If I do what I can to speak against him, she won’t love him much longer. But even if she stops loving Valentine, it doesn’t mean she will love Sir Thurio.</p>

<b>THURIO</b>
<p>Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,</p>
<p>Lest it should ravel and be good to none,</p>
<p>You must provide to bottom it on me;</p>

<p>As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.</p>

<p>So, as you break down her love for him, you must build it back up around me, so that it doesn’t come apart and become useless to everyone. You must do this by praising me as much as you dispraise Sir Valentine.</p>

<td class="left">
<b>DUKE</b>
<p>And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind</p>
<p>Because we know, on Valentine’s report,</p>
<p>You are already Love’s firm votary</p>
<p>And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.</p>
<p>Upon this warrant shall you have access</p>
<p>Where you with Sylvia may confer at large;</p>
<p>For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,</p>
<p>And, for your friend’s sake, will be glad of you,</p>
<p>Where you may temper her by your persuasion</p>
<p>To hate young Valentine and love my friend.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>DUKE</b>
<p>And, Proteus, we feel we can trust you with this task because we know, from what Valentine told us, that you’re already in love and can’t quickly fall out of love. For this reason you will be allowed to speak to Sylvia as you like. She is sad, sullen, and melancholy, and she’ll be happy to see you because you’re close to Valentine. Then you can shape her by your persuasion to hate young Valentine and love my friend, Sir Thurio.</p>

<tr>
<td class="left">
<b>PROTEUS</b>
<p>As much as I can do, I will effect.</p>
<p>But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;</p>
<p>You must lay lime to tangle her desires</p>
<p>By wailful sonnets, whose composèd rhymes</p>
<p>Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>PROTEUS</b>
<p>I will do as much as I can. But you, Sir Thurio, aren’t doing enough to win her. To entice her and capture her desires, you must write sonnets whose well-crafted rhymes should be filled with vows of devotion.</p>

<p>Ay, much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.</p>
</td>

<p>Yes, poetry bred by heaven is very powerful.</p>

<p>Say that upon the altar of her beauty</p>
<p>You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart.</p>
<p>Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears</p>
<p>Moist it again, and frame some feeling line</p>
<p>That may discover such integrity:</p>
<p>For Orpheus’ lute was strung with poets’ sinews,</p>
<p>Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,</p>
<p>Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans</p>
<p>Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.</p>
<p>After your dire-lamenting elegies,</p>
<p>Visit by night your lady’s chamber window</p>
<p>With some sweet consort. To their instruments</p>
<p>Tune a deploring dump; the night’s dead silence</p>
<p>Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.</p>
<p>This, or else nothing, will inherit her.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>PROTEUS</b>
<p>Say that you sacrifice your tears, your sighs, and your heart on the altar of her beauty. Write until your ink dries up and then moisten it again with your tears, and craft some emotional line that reveals your sincerity—after all, Orpheus’ lute was made from the same stuff as poetry and could soften steel and stones, make tigers tame, and cause huge whales to leave the deep ocean and dance on the sand. After you give her your love poems, go to her bedroom window at night with a group of musicians. While they play, sing a sad melody, and the silent night will enhance such sweet heartsick yearning. If that doesn’t win her, nothing will.</p>
