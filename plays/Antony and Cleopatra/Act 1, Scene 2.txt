  - sp: CHARMIAN
    o:
      - "Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?"
    m:
      - "Well, if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me, where would you like the improvement?"

  - sp: IRAS
    o:

Oh, let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee, and let her die too, and give him a worse, and let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight, good Isis, I beseech thee!"
    m:
      - "May heaven save us from indecent thoughts! Alexas! *(to the FORTUNETELLER)* Come and tell his fortune. Let him marry a woman he can’t satisfy, dear Isis, I pray! And then let her die, and give him someone worse. Then let *her* die, and let her replacement be even worse. And so on until the last one, who is unfaithful with at least fifty other men and laughs at him until he dies. I beg you to grant my prayer, good Isis, even though it means you deny me something more important for myself. Good Isis, I beg you!"

  - sp: IRAS
    o:
      - "Amen, dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly."
    m:
      - "Amen, dear goddess. Listen to our prayer. If it’s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife, it’s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who’s faithful. Therefore, dear Isis, do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves."

  - sp: CHARMIAN
    o:
      - "Amen."
    m:
      - "Amen."

  - sp: ALEXAS
    o:
      - "*(to himself)* Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they would make themselves whores but they’d do ’t."
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* See! If they could make me a cuckold, they’d whore themselves in order to see it done."

    o:
      - "Hush! Here comes Antony."
    m:
      - "Quiet! Here comes Antony."

      - "Upon the first encounter drave them."
    m:
      - "Yes. But that war ended as soon as circumstances made it advisable for them to join together against Caesar. But in their very first battle, Caesar won and drove them out of Italy."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "Well, what worst?"
    m:
      - "Well, give me the worst news."

  - sp: FIRST MESSENGER
    o:

    m:
      - "The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it."

    o:

      - "Things that are past are done, with me. ’Tis thus:"
      - "Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,"
      - "I hear him as he flattered."
    m:
      - "Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward. Go on. As far as I’m concerned, what’s past is done. It’s like this: as long as a person tells me the truth, even though it means my death, I will listen as though he praised me."

  - sp: FIRST MESSENGER

      - "His conquering banner shook, from Syria"
      - "To Lydia and to Ionia,"
      - "Whilst—"
    m:

      - "Is as our earing."
    m:
      - "Speak plainly. Don’t tone down what the people are saying. Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her. Use Fulvia’s abusive language. Freely scold me for my faults with as much severity as an enemy with truth on his side. It’s easy to err when left to our own devices, but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them."

What’s enjoyable one day becomes the opposite as time rolls around. Now that she’s gone, I want her. Now I would call her back, though I pushed her away. I have to break from this beguiling Queen. The time I’ve wasted here has caused ten thousand more problems than the ones I know about*. (calling)* Are you there, Enobarbus?"

    o:
      - "Why, then, we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to them. If they suffer our departure, death’s the word."
    m:

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly. I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying."
    m:
      - "If it’s that important, then let the women die. It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing, but if it’s a matter of choosing between them and a great cause, then they’re worthless. If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this, she’ll die immediately. I’ve seen her claim to be dying twenty times before, and for far less reason. I think there must be something invigorating about death, since she dies with such enthusiasm."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "She is cunning past man’s thought."
    m:
      - "She’s more cunning than anyone can imagine."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears. They are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her. If it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove."
    m:
      - "Alas, sir, no, her feelings come from pure love, not cleverness. Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods. She has more storms and tempests in her than a weather almanac. Her temper is not a trick or a skill—if it is, she can make it rain as well as Jove."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "Would I had never seen her!"
    m:
      - "I wish I’d never seen her!"

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "O sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel."
    m:
      - "Then you’d have missed an amazing piece of work, sir, and your trip would have been poorer for the loss."

    o:
      - "Dead."
    m:
      - "Dead."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth, comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief is crowned with consolation. Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow."
    m:
      - "Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks. When a man’s wife dies, he can be comforted by the knowledge that there are replacements to be found. If Fulvia were the last woman on earth, there would be a reason to grieve. But in this way, grief and comfort appear together. The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose."

      - "And the business you have broached here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra’s, which wholly depends on your abode."
    m:

      - "No more light answers. Let our officers"
      - "Have notice what we purpose. I shall break"
      - "The cause of our expedience to the Queen"

    m:
      - "Enough of this frivolous talk. Give our officers notice of our intentions. I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave. Fulvia’s death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go; friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return. Sextus Pompeius has challenged Caesar. His fleet controls the sea. Our fickle citizens—who never reward service until that service is over—are now giving all the rights and honors won by Pompey the Great to his son, Sextus. Sextus has great honor and power, and his spirit and energy are even greater, all of which makes him the most formidable soldier in the empire. The empire may be in danger if he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential. There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats. Like horse’s hairs dropped in a bucket of water, they come alive like snakes but as yet they bear no poison. Relay our intentions to the officers who will be in charge of the move."
