<p>Hear me, Queen:</p>
<p>The strong necessity of time commands</p>
<p>Our services awhile, but my full heart</p>
<p>Remains in use with you. Our Italy</p>
<p>Shines o’er with civil swords. Sextus Pompeius</p>
<p>Makes his approaches to the port of Rome.</p>
<p>Equality of two domestic powers</p>
<p>Breed scrupulous faction. The hated, grown to strength,</p>
<p>Are newly grown to love. The condemned Pompey,</p>
<p>Rich in his father’s honor, creeps apace</p>
<p>Into the hearts of such as have not thrived</p>
<p>Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;</p>
<p>And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge</p>
<p>By any desperate change. My more particular,</p>
<p>And that which most with you should safe my going,</p>
<p>Is Fulvia’s death.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ANTONY</b>
<p>Listen to me, Queen. There is an emergency I must take care of, but my whole heart will remain here with you. My Italy is full of civil war. Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome. When two domestic opponents are equally matched—as we are against Pompey—factions will form on the smallest of pretexts. When a formerly hated man grows powerful, he suddenly finds himself with many supporters. Pompey, who was once condemned, now wields his father’s power, and all the citizens who have grievances against the government are joining him. Pompey’s numbers are steadily growing, and the government is ready to do something desperate. But my personal motivation—and that which should move you most to sanction my departure—is that Fulvia is dead.</p>
