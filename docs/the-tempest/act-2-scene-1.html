<p><em>(to ALONSO)</em> Please cheer up, sir. Like all of us, you have a good reason to be happy. The fact that we’re alive outweighs our losses. Many people every day feel the sadness we feel now. Every day some sailor’s wife, a ship’s crew, the merchant who hired the ship all experience the same loss we’ve undergone. But the miracle—the fact that we were saved—only happens to a few people out of millions. So remember that, and take comfort in it, to counterbalance our sadness.</p>
