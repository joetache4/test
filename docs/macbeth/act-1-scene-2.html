<p>Doubtful it stood,</p>

<p>Worthy to be a rebel, for to that</p>
<p>The multiplying villanies of nature</p>
<p>Do swarm upon him—from the Western Isles</p>
<p>Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied,</p>
<p>And fortune, on his damnèd quarrel smiling,</p>
<p>Showed like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak,</p>
<p>For brave Macbeth—well he deserves that name—</p>
<p>Disdaining fortune, with his brandished steel,</p>
<p>Which smoked with bloody execution,</p>
<p>Like valor’s minion carved out his passage</p>
<p>Till he faced the slave;</p>
<p>Which ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,</p>
<p>Till he unseamed him from the nave to th’ chops,</p>
<p>And fixed his head upon our battlements.</p>

<b>CAPTAIN</b>
<p>For a while you couldn’t tell who would win. The armies were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and struggling in the water, unable to move. The villainous rebel Macdonwald was supported by foot soldiers and horsemen from Ireland and the Hebrides, and Lady Luck was with him, smiling cruelly at his enemies as if she were his whore. But Luck and Macdonwald together weren’t strong enough. Brave Macbeth, laughing at Luck, chopped his way through to Macdonwald, who didn’t even have time to say good-bye or shake hands before Macbeth split him open from his navel to his jawbone and stuck his head on our castle walls.</p>

<p>As whence the sun ’gins his reflection</p>
<p>Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,</p>
<p>So from that spring whence comfort seemed to come</p>
<p>Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:</p>
<p>No sooner justice had, with valor armed,</p>
<p>Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels,</p>
<p>But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,</p>
<p>With furbished arms and new supplies of men,</p>
<p>Began a fresh assault.</p>

<b>CAPTAIN</b>
<p>But in the same way that violent storms always come just as spring appears, our success against Macdonwald created new problems for us. Listen to this, King: as soon as we sent those Irish soldiers running for cover, the Norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons.</p>

<p>Yes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.</p>
<p>If I say sooth, I must report they were</p>
<p>As cannons overcharged with double cracks,</p>
<p>So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.</p>

<b>CAPTAIN</b>
<p>The new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles, or rabbits frighten a lion. To tell you the truth, they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition. Maybe they wanted to take a bath in their enemies’ blood, or make that battlefield as infamous as Golgotha, where Christ was crucified, I don’t know. But I feel weak. My wounds must be tended to.</p>
