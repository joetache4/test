<p>Upon a lie seven times removed.—Bear your body more seeming, Audrey.—As thus, sir: I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is called “the retort courteous.” If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself. This is called “the quip modest.” If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment. This is called “the reply churlish.” If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is called “the reproof valiant.” If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This is called “the countercheck quarrelsome,” and so to “the lie circumstantial” and “the lie direct.”</p>

<b>TOUCHSTONE</b>
<p>Our argument went through seven stages—watch your posture, Audrey.—It went like this. I didn’t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard. He sent me word that, whether I liked it or not, he liked it fine. They call this “the courteous retort.” If I repeat that it isn’t cut well, and he responds that he isn’t trying to please me, just himself, with his beard. They call this “ the modest quip.” If I say again it is poorly cut, and he responds that my judgment is no good, they call this “the sullen reply.” If I say yet again that his beard is poorly cut, and he says that I’m not speaking the truth, they call this “the brave retort.” One more time I say it’s not well cut, and he says I’m lying. They call this “the argumentative countercheck.” And so on through “the circumstantial lie” and “the direct lie.”</p>

<p>O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees: the first, “the retort courteous”; the second, “the quip modest”; the third, “the reply churlish”; the fourth, “the reproof valiant”; the fifth, “the countercheque quarrelsome”; the sixth, “the lie with circumstance”; the seventh, “the lie direct.” All these you may avoid but the lie direct, and you may avoid that, too, with an “if.” I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an “if,” as: “If you said so, then I said so.” And they shook hands and swore brothers. Your “if” is the only peacemaker: much virtue in “if.”</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>TOUCHSTONE</b>
<p>Of course, sir. There are rulebooks for arguing just as there are rulebooks for manners. Here are the steps. First is “the courteous retort”; second, “the modest quip”; third, “the sullen reply”; fourth, “the valiant retort”; fifth, “the argumentative countercheck”; sixth, “the circumstantial lie”; seventh, “the direct lie.” You can avoid getting to that final stage if you can properly use an “if.” I once heard of an argument that seven judges couldn’t settle. The two parties met up on their own, and one said, “Well, if you said this-and-that, then I must have said such-and-such,” and they shook hands and parted on good terms. “If” is the only peacemaker. “If” is a very valuable word.</p>

But first, let’s finish the things we started out here. Then I’ll share the abundance of my returned fortune with all those that have stayed out here with me, according to the rank and status each of you enjoy. But until then, let’s forget our nobility and enjoy some fun. Music, please. Brides and bridegrooms, dance your happiness away.</p>

<p>Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly,</p>
<p>The duke hath put on a religious life</p>
<p>And thrown into neglect the pompous court.</p>

<p>Wait a minute, sir. Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk?</p>

<p>I will go find him. There is much to be learned from these converts. <em>(to DUKE SENIOR)</em> I bestow on you your former honor, for your patience and virtue. <em>(to ORLANDO)</em> I give you the love that your faithfulness deserves <em>(to OLIVER)</em> and you your land, your love, and your great allies. <em>(to SILVIUS)</em> You get a long and well-deserved stay in bed, with your new wife. <em>(to TOUCHSTONE)</em> And you I expect to be up fighting soon. The honeymoon will last two months, tops.— And with that, you may all return to your dancing. I’m bound for another fate.</p>

<b>ROSALIND</b>
<p>It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue, but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes, and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a case am I in, then, that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play. I am not furnished like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you, and I’ll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you. And I charge you, O men, for the love you bear to women— as I perceive by your simpering, none of you hates them— that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me, complexions that liked me, and breaths that I defied not. And I am sure as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</p>

<b>ROSALIND</b>
<p>You don’t usually see a woman deliver an epilogue, but it’s no worse than seeing a man deliver the prologue. If it’s true that you don’t need ivy to sell good wine, then it should also be true that a good play doesn’t need an epilogue. But they use good-quality ivy to sell good wine, and a good play is improved by a good epilogue. But then I’m in a strange position, as I not only do not have a good epilogue, I’m not sure this was a good play. I’m not dressed like a beggar, so it wouldn’t be becoming for me to beg. No, instead I’ll bewitch you, and I’ll start with the women. Women, in the name of the love you have for men, I demand that you like as much of this play as you feel like. Men, in the name of the women you love—and I can guess by your goofy smiles that none of you exactly hates them—the play will act as a nice toy for you and the ladies to share. If I actually were a woman, I’d kiss all of you that have beards that pleased me, complexions that I liked, and breath that wasn’t foul. And I’m sure that all of you with nice beards, good faces, and sweet breath will, when I curtsy good night, give me a nice round of applause.</p>
