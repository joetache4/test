  - os: "Enter EDMUND the bastard, with a letter"
    ms: "EDMUND enters with a letter."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "Thou, nature, art my goddess. To thy law"
      - "My services are bound. Wherefore should I"
      - "Stand in the plague of custom and permit"
      - "The curiosity of nations to deprive me"
      - "For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines"
      - "Lag of a brother? Why “bastard”? Wherefore “base”?"
      - "When my dimensions are as well compact,"
      - "My mind as generous, and my shape as true"
      - "As honest madam’s issue? Why brand they us"
      - "With “base,” with “baseness,” “bastardy,” “base,” “base”—"
      - "Who in the lusty stealth of nature take"
      - "More composition and fierce quality"
      - "Than doth within a dull, stale, tirèd bed"
      - "Go to th’ creating a whole tribe of fops"
      - "Got ’tween a sleep and wake? Well then,"
      - "Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land."
      - "Our father’s love is to the bastard Edmund"
      - "As to the legitimate.—Fine word, “legitimate”!—"
      - "Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed"
      - "And my invention thrive, Edmund the base"
      - "Shall top th’ legitimate. I grow, I prosper."
      - "Now, gods, stand up for bastards!"
    m:
      - "I only worship what’s natural, not what’s manmade. Why should I let myself be tortured by manmade social customs that deprive me of my rights simply because I was born twelve or fourteen months later than my older brother? Why do they call me “bastard” and “lowlife” when I’m just as gifted in mind and body as legitimate children? Why do they call us bastards “lowlifes”? Always “lowlife,” “bastard,” “lowlife,” “lowlife.” At least we bastards were conceived in a moment of passionate lust rather than in a dull, tired marriage bed, where half-sleeping parents monotonously churn out a bunch of sissy kids. All right then, legitimate brother Edgar, I have to have your lands. Our father loves me just as much as the legitimate Edgar. What a nice word that is, “legitimate”! Well, my legitimate Edgar, if this letter works and my plan succeeds, Edmund the lowlife will beat the legitimate. Look out, I’m on my way up. Three cheers for bastards!"

    ms: "GLOUCESTER enters. EDMUND looks over his letter."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "Kent banished thus? And France in choler parted?"
      - "And the king gone tonight, prescribed his power"
      - "Confined to exhibition? All this done"
      - "Upon the gad?—Edmund, how now? What news?"
    m:
      - "Kent’s been banished just like that? And the King of France gone in a huff? And King Lear’s abdicated his authority, making his kingship a ceremonial title only? All this so suddenly?—Edmund, what’s going on? What’s the news?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "*(pocketing the letter)* So please your lordship, none."
    m:
      - "*(pocketing the letter)* No news, my lord."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?"
    m:
      - "Why are you hiding that letter?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "I know no news, my lord."
    m:
      - "I don’t have any news to report, my lord."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "What paper were you reading?"
    m:
      - "What’s that paper you were reading?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "Nothing, my lord."
    m:
      - "It’s nothing, my lord."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let’s see.—Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles."
    m:
      - "No? Then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry? If it were nothing, you wouldn’t need to hide it. Let’s see it. Come on, if it’s nothing, I won’t need glasses to read it."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o’er-read. And for so much as I have perused, I find it not fit for your o’erlooking."
    m:
      - "Please, sir, I beg you. It’s a letter from my brother that I haven’t finished reading yet. But judging from the bit I have read, it’s not fit for you to see."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "Give me the letter, sir."
    m:
      - "Give me that letter, sir."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame."
    m:
      - "Now I’ll offend you whether I give it to you or not. The problem is in what the letter says, as far as I can tell."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "*(taking the letter)* Let’s see, let’s see."
    m:
      - "*(taking the letter)* Let’s see, let’s see."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "I hope, for my brother’s justification, he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue."
    m:
      - "I hope for my brother’s sake that he just wrote it to test my honor."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "*(reads)*"
      - "“This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times, keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who sways not as it hath power but as it is suffered."
    m:
      - "*(reads)*"
      - "”The custom of respecting the elderly makes it hard for the young and healthy to live well, and keeps us without our inheritance until we are so old we can’t enjoy our happiness anyway. The power of the elderly is starting to feel like a silly and foolish slavery to me, and they only enjoy that power because we let them have it."

  - o:
      - "Come to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue forever, and live the beloved of your brother,"
      - "    Edgar.“"
      - "Hum, conspiracy? ”’Sleep till I wake him, you should enjoy half his revenue“—my son Edgar? Had he a hand to write this, a heart and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it?"
    m:
      - "Come talk to me about this. If our father were dead you’d receive half of his revenue forever, and you’d have my undying love,"
      - "    Edgar.”"
      - "Hmm, what’s this, a conspiracy? “If our father were dead, you’d receive half of his revenue forever”—my son Edgar? How did he bring himself to write such a thing? How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart? How did you get this letter? Who delivered it?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "It was not brought me, my lord. There’s the cunning of it."
      - "I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet."
    m:
      - "Nobody delivered it, my lord. That’s what’s clever about it. It was tossed into the window of my room."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "You know the character to be your brother’s?"
    m:
      - "You’re sure the handwriting is your brother’s?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his."
      - "But in respect of that, I would fain think it were not."
    m:
      - "If he’d written nice things, I’d swear yes right away. But as it stands, I wish I could believe it wasn’t."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "It is his."
    m:
      - "But it is his handwriting?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "It is his hand, my lord, but I hope his heart is not in the contents."
    m:
      - "It’s his handwriting, my lord, but I hope he didn’t mean what he wrote."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "Has he never before sounded you in this business?"
    m:
      - "Has he ever tested out these ideas on you before?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age and fathers declined, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue."
    m:
      - "Never, my lord. But I’ve often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining, the sons should be their fathers’ guardians and manage their fathers’ money."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain—worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him. I’ll apprehend him. Abominable villain! Where is he?"
    m:
      - "Oh, what a villain! That’s just what he said in the letter. Evil villain! Monstrous, hateful, bestial villain! Worse than a beast! Go look for him. I’ll arrest him. Horrid villain! Where is he?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain course—where if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honor and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honor and to no other pretense of danger."
    m:
      - "I’m not sure, my lord. But it may be a good idea to restrain your rage until you find out exactly what he meant. If you go after him and then find out that you made a mistake, it would damage your reputation and greatly undermine his loyalty to you. I’ll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you, and for no other reason."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "Think you so?"
    m:
      - "Do you think so?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "If your honor judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction—and that without any further delay than this very evening."
    m:
      - "If you agree, I’ll hide you somewhere where you can eavesdrop on us talking about it, and hear how he feels with your own ears. You won’t have to wait longer than until tonight."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "He cannot be such a monster—"
    m:
      - "He can’t possibly be such a monster—"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "Nor is not, sure."
    m:
      - "And I’m sure he isn’t."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out, wind me into him, I pray you. Frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution."
    m:
      - "—toward his own father who loves him so completely. Oh, God! Edmund, go find him. Gain his confidence for me, please. Manage him however you think best. I’d give up my rank and fortune to be free from my doubts."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "I will seek him, sir, presently, convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal."
    m:
      - "I’ll find him right away, sir, and carry out the business as well as I can. Then I’ll let you know what’s happening."

  - sp: GLOUCESTER
    o:
      - "These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide, in cities mutinies, in countries discord, in palaces treason, and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction—there’s son against father. The king falls from bias of nature—there’s father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund. It shall lose thee nothing. Do it carefully.—And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished, his offense honesty! ’Tis strange, strange."
    m:
      - "These recent eclipses of the sun and moon don’t bode well for us. Though science can explain them away, disasters still come after eclipses. Love cools off, friendships break up, and brothers become enemies. Riots break out, civil war erupts, kings are betrayed, and the bond between father and son snaps. This wicked son of mine confirms the prediction —son against father. The king acts unnaturally—father against child. We’ve seen the best our age has to offer. Conspiracies, fakery, betrayal, and disorder are all that’s left until we die. Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking, Edmund. You won’t lose any respect. Just do it carefully.—And to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished, for the crime of telling the truth! It’s strange, strange."

  - os: "Exit GLOUCESTER"
    ms: "GLOUCESTER exits."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune—often the surfeit of our own behavior—we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if we were villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence, and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting-on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the dragon’s tail and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut, I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar—"
    m:
      - "This is a classic example of the idiocy of the world: when we’re down and out—often because of our own excesses —we put all the blame on the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if they forced us to be bad, or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid. As if we become thieves and traitors according to astrological signs or obey planetary influences to become drunks, liars, and adulterers! As if some universal power pushed us into evil deeds! What a sneaky trick it is for lustful mankind to blame our horniness on some star! My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending, and I was born under the Big Dipper, so it’s inevitable that I’m rude and oversexed. Christ! I would have been what I am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception. Edgar—"

  - os: "Enter EDGAR"
    ms: "EDGAR enters."

  - o:
      - "and pat on ’s cue he comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy. My cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o’ Bedlam. Oh, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi."
    m:
      - "and, speak of the devil, here he comes, right on cue. I’ve got to play the role and sigh like a poor beggar.—Oh, these eclipses predict such disorder. Fa, sol, la, mi."

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:
      - "How now, brother Edmund? What serious contemplation are you in?"
    m:
      - "Hello, brother Edmund. What are you thinking about so seriously?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, what should follow these eclipses."
    m:
      - "I was thinking about what an astrologer predicted the other day. He wrote about what these eclipses mean."

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:
      - "Do you busy yourself about that?"
    m:
      - "Are you spending your valuable time on that?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily — as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent, death, dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities, divisions in state, menaces and maledictions against king and nobles, needless diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what."
    m:
      - "Oh, I assure you the things he writes about are wretched —things like divisions between parents and children, death, famine, broken friendships, political rebellion, treason against the king and noblemen, exiled friends, dissolved armies, adultery, and I don’t know what else."

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:
      - "How long have you been a sectary astronomical?"
    m:
      - "How long have you believed in astrology?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:

    m:
      - "Come on. When was the last time you saw my father?"

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:
      - "Why, the night gone by."
    m:
      - "Why, last night."

  - sp: EDMUND

      - "Spake you with him?"
    m:
      - "Did you speak to him?"

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:
      - "Ay, two hours together."
    m:
      - "Yes, we talked for a couple of hours."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance?"
    m:
      - "Did you leave on good terms? Did he express any dissatisfaction with you, either in his words or his face?"

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:
      - "None at all."
    m:
      - "No, none at all."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him. And at my entreaty forbear his presence till some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay."
    m:
      - "Try to remember how you might have offended him, and try to avoid spending time with him until his anger has cooled a little. Right now he’s so angry that even if he harmed you physically, he’d still be raging."

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:
      - "Some villain hath done me wrong."
    m:
      - "Some villain has told lies about me."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "That’s my fear. I pray you, have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower. And as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak. Pray ye, go. There’s my key. If you do stir abroad, go armed."
    m:
      - "That’s what I’m afraid of. I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little. In the meantime, come home with me, and when the time is right I’ll take you to talk to him. Please go. Here’s my key. If you go outside, arm yourself."

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:
      - "Armed, brother?"
    m:
      - "Arm myself?"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "Brother, I advise you to the best. Go armed. I am no honest man if there be any good meaning towards you. I have told you what I have seen and heard—but faintly, nothing like the image and horror of it. Pray you, away."
    m:
      - "Brother, I’m giving you good advice. Arm yourself. I’d be a liar if I told you nobody wanted to hurt you. I’ve told you what I’ve seen and heard, but I’ve toned it down a lot. I’ve spared you you the full extent of the horror that threatens you. Now please go."

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:

      - "Whose nature is so far from doing harms"
      - "That he suspects none, on whose foolish honesty"
      - "My practices ride easy. I see the business."
      - "Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit."
      - "All with me’s meet that I can fashion fit."
    m:
      - "A gullible father and a brother who’s so innocent that he can’t suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him—these are the two fools I need for my plan to work. I know exactly how to proceed. If I can’t have an estate by birthright, then I’ll get it by being clever. Any trick that works is good for me."
