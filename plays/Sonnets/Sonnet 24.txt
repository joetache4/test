      - "Mine eye hath played the painter and hath steeled"
      - "Thy beauty’s form in table of my heart."
      - "My body is the frame wherein ’tis held,"
      - "And pérspective it is best painter’s art."
      - "For through the painter must you see his skill"
      - "To find where your true image pictured lies,"
      - "Which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,"
      - "That hath his windows glazèd with thine eyes."
      - "Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:"
      - "Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me"
      - "Are windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun"
      - "Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee."
      - "  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;"
      - "  They draw but what they see, know not the heart."

      - "My eye has acted like a painter and engraved your beautiful image on the canvas of my heart. My body is the frame that holds this picture; to draw that picture with perspective, realistically representing depth, is the highest skill a painter could have. Only via this painter—my eye—can you find the image of you that dwells continually in my heart: Your own eyes are the windows into my heart. Now look at the favors our eyes have done for each other: My eyes have drawn your shape, and your eyes are windows into which I can look to see my own heart, into which the sun also likes to look, taking a peep at your reflection. Yet my eyes lack a certain skill that would grace the others they already have: They can only draw what they see; they don’t see into your heart."
