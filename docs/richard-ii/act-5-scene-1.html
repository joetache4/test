<p>Fair lady, don’t grieve as if I were already dead. Think of our past as a happy dream and that we have simply awoken to reality. I’ve had to bow to necessity, and I’ll stay that way until I die. Go quickly to France and join a convent. Our only hope is to become holy and be crowned in heaven, since our lives here have ended in such ruin.</p>

<p>What, has my Richard been changed and weakened in both body and mind? Has Bolingbroke overthrown your mind? Has he turned your heart?

<p>Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:</p>

<p>And send the hearers weeping to their beds:</p>
<p>For why, the senseless brands will sympathize</p>
<p>The heavy accent of thy moving tongue</p>
<p>And in compassion weep the fire out;</p>
<p>And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,</p>

<p>A king of beasts, indeed. If only they weren’t beasts, I would still be a happy king of men. Good former queen, get ready to go to France. Think of me as dead, and say goodbye to me now as if I were on my deathbed. Through long winter nights sit by the fire with good people and let them tell you stories of sad times long ago. And before you say good night, tell them my sadder story and send them weeping to their beds. Even the firewood will sympathize and cry out their fires. And some will be so unhappy at the story of the overthrow of a rightful king that they will cover themselves in ashes.</p>

<b>KING RICHARD II</b>
<p>Northumberland, Bolingbroke is mounting my throne on your ladder, but it won’t take very long until you turn against each other. You’ll think that even though he gives you half the kingdom, it’s not enough, since you helped him get it all. And he’ll think that you, who knows how to put undeserving kings in the throne, will know how to remove him from the stolen throne. Wicked men’s love soon turns to fear, then to hate, and from there one or both of them will become dangerous and die a violent death.</p>
