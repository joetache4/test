<p>There be some sports are painful, and their labor</p>

<p>Ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed,</p>
<p>And he’s composed of harshness. I must remove</p>
<p>Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,</p>
<p>Upon a sore injunction. My sweet mistress</p>
<p>Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness</p>
<p>Had never like executor. I forget,</p>

<b>FERDINAND</b>
<p>Some games are painful, but their discomfort makes them more fun. Some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons. And you can do poor things that lead to rich results. This hard work would be boring and nasty to me, but I’m working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor. Oh, she’s ten times nicer than her father is mean, and he’s the height of crabbiness. I have thousands of logs to take away and pile up, on strict orders from him. My sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before. These sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me, especially when I’m slaving away busily.</p>

<p>Miranda—the very name means “admired!” You are indeed admired, more than anything else in the world! I’ve looked at many ladies with pleasure, and been seduced by the sweet nothings they said to me. I’ve liked several women for their good qualities, but there was something wrong with each one that blotted her excellent qualities and cancelled them out. But with you it’s different. You’re perfect, without a rival in the world, made up of the best qualities of every creature.</p>

<p>The jewel in my dower, I would not wish</p>
<p>Any companion in the world but you,</p>

But listen to me chattering like crazy, and father always told me not to.</p>
