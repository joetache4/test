  - sp: ALEXAS
    o:
      - "    Half afeard to come."
    m:
      - "He’s afraid to come in."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA

  - sp: ALEXAS
    o:
      - "    Good majesty,"
      - "Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you"
      - "But when you are well pleased."
    m:
      - "Gracious Queen, even Herod of Judea wouldn’t dare look at you unless you were in a good mood."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    That Herod’s head"
      - "I’ll have! But how? When Antony is gone,"
      - "Through whom I might command it? *(to MESSENGER)* Come thou near."
    m:
      - "I’ll have Herod’s head chopped off! But now that Antony’s gone, who will do it for me? *(to MESSENGER)* Come closer."

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "Most gracious majesty!"
    m:
      - "Most formidable Queen!"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    Didst thou behold Octavia?"
    m:
      - "Did you see Octavia?"

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "Ay, dread Queen."
    m:
      - "Yes, revered Queen."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    Where?"
    m:
      - "Where?"

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "    Madam, in Rome."
      - "I looked her in the face, and saw her led"
      - "Between her brother and Mark Antony."
    m:
      - "In Rome, Madam. I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Is she as tall as me?"
    m:
      - "Is she as tall as I am?"

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "    She is not, madam."
    m:
      - "She is not, madam."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongued or low?"
    m:
      - "Did you hear her speak? Is her voice pitched high or low?"

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "Madam, I heard her speak. She is low-voiced."
    m:
      - "Madam, I heard her speak. She has a low-pitched voice."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "That’s not so good. He cannot like her long."
    m:
      - "That’s not in her favor. He can’t like her very long."

  - sp: CHARMIAN
    o:
      - "Like her? O Isis, ’tis impossible."
    m:
      - "Like her? Oh, Isis, that’s impossible."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue, and dwarfish.—"
      - "What majesty is in her gait? Remember,"
      - "If e’er thou looked’st on majesty."
    m:
      - "You’re right, Charmian. She’s both dull-spoken and dwarfishly little.—Did she carry herself with majesty? Compare her to any memory you might have of royalty."

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "    She creeps."
      - "Her motion and her station are as one."
      - "She shows a body rather than a life,"
      - "A statue than a breather."
    m:
      - "She creeps along. Moving or standing still, her bearing is about the same. She has a body, not a life. She’s more like a statue than a living, breathing human being."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    Is this certain?"
    m:
      - "Is this true?"

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "Or I have no observance."
    m:
      - "If not, then I have no powers of observation."

  - sp: CHARMIAN
    o:
      - "    Three in Egypt Cannot make better note."
    m:
      - "There aren’t three people in all of Egypt who could do better."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    He’s very knowing,"
      - "I do perceive ’t. There’s nothing in her yet."
      - "The fellow has good judgment."
    m:
      - "He’s very observant. I can tell. She doesn’t have anything going for her so far. This messenger is wise."

  - sp: CHARMIAN
    o:
      - "    Excellent."
    m:
      - "Very wise."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "*(to MESSENGER)* Guess at her years, I prithee."
    m:
      - "*(to MESSENGER)* How old do you think she is?"

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "Madam, she was a widow—"
    m:
      - "She was a widow previously, madam."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Widow? Charmian, hark."
    m:
      - "A widow? Do you hear that, Charmian?"

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "And I do think she’s thirty."
    m:
      - "And I think she’s at least thirty."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Bear’st thou her face in mind? Is ’t long or round?"
    m:
      - "Do you remember her face? Was it long or round?"

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "Round, even to faultiness."
    m:
      - "Round enough to be unattractive."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so."
      - "Her hair, what color?"
    m:
      - "Usually that means a person is foolish. What color is her hair?"

  - sp: MESSENGER
    o:
      - "Brown, madam, and her forehead"
      - "As low as she would wish it."
    m:
      - "Brown, madam, and she wouldn’t want her forehead to be any lower."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "*(giving money)*            There’s gold for thee."
      - "Thou must not take my former sharpness ill."
      - "I will employ thee back again; I find thee"
      - "Most fit for business. Go make thee ready;"
      - "Our letters are prepared."
    m:
      - "Here’s gold for you. You mustn’t hold my earlier outburst against me. I’ll hire you again to go back to Rome. I find that you’re very good at this kind of work. Go, prepare to travel. My letters are ready to go."

  - os: "Exit MESSENGER"
    ms: "The MESSENGER exits."

  - sp: CHARMIAN
    o:
      - "    A proper man."
    m:
      - "He’s an admirable man."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Indeed, he is so. I repent me much"
      - "That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,"
      - "This creature’s no such thing."
    m:
      - "He certainly is. I’m very sorry I was so hard on him. Why, from what he says, Octavia isn’t worth getting upset over."

  - sp: CHARMIAN
    o:
      - "    Nothing, madam."
    m:
      - "Not a bit, madam."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "The man hath seen some majesty and should know."
    m:
      - "This man’s been around royalty. He should recognize it when he sees it."

  - sp: CHARMIAN
    o:
      - "Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,"
      - "And serving you so long!"
    m:
      - "Been around royalty! Isis forbid it were otherwise, since he’s been in your service so long."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian—"
      - "But ’tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me"
      - "Where I will write. All may be well enough."
    m:
      - "I want to ask him one more thing, Charmian. But it’s not important. Bring him to my writing room. Everything may still be all right."

  - sp: CHARMIAN
    o:
      - "I warrant you, madam."
    m:
      - "I assure you it is, madam."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
