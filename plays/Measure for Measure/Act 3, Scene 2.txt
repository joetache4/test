    ms: "The street outside the prison."

  - os: "Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before; on the other, ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEY"
    ms: "DUKE VINCENTIO, disguised as before, enters on one side. ELBOW and officers with POMPEY enter on the other."

  - sp: ELBOW
    o:
      - "Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will"
      - "needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we"
      - "shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard."
    m:
      - "No, but if you go on buying and selling men and women like beasts, everyone in the world will end up spawning bastards."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "O heavens! what stuff is here"
    m:
      - "Oh, heavens! What nonsense is this?"

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "’Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the"
      - "merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by"
      - "order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and"
      - "furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that"
      - "craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing."
    m:
      - "Life’s become a lot less fun since the law took two crimes—prostitution and moneylending—and suppressed the one that was the most fun, while condoning the worse of the two. The thriving moneylender wraps himself in a warm fur coat, made of skins from the innocent lamb and trimmed in fur from the crafty fox, proving that craftiness is worth more than innocence."

  - sp: ELBOW
    o:
      - "Come your way, sir. ’Bless you, good father friar."
    m:
      - "Come along, sir. Bless you, good father friar."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "And you, good brother father. What offence hath"
      - "this man made you, sir?"
    m:
      - "And you, good brother father. How has this man offended you, sir?"

  - sp: ELBOW
    o:
      - "Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we"
      - "take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found"
      - "upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have"
      - "sent to the deputy."
    m:
      - "Actually, sir, he has offended the law. And, sir, we take him to be a thief too, sir, because we found on him, sir, a strange device for picking locks, which we have sent to the deputy."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!"
      - "The evil that thou causest to be done,"
      - "That is thy means to live. Do thou but think"
      - "What ’tis to cram a maw or clothe a back"
      - "From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,"
      - "From their abominable and beastly touches"
      - "I drink, I eat, array myself, and live."
      - "Canst thou believe thy living is a life,"
      - "So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend."
    m:
      - "*(to POMPEY)* Shame, sirrah! A pimp, a wicked pimp! You support yourself by doing evil. Do you ever stop to think what it is to stuff your mouth or clothe your back from such a filthy vice? Say to yourself, I eat, dress myself, and live off abominable, beastly sex. Can you believe your way of life is a life, when it’s dependent on such stinking acts? Change your ways, change your ways."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,"
      - "sir, I would prove—"
    m:
      - "Yes, it does stink in a way, sir; but, sir, I would prove—"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,"
      - "Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:"
      - "Correction and instruction must both work"
      - "Ere this rude beast will profit."
    m:
      - "No, if the devil has given you excuses for sin, you’ll prove only that you belong to him. Take him to prison, officer. Punishment and religion must both be used on this crude beast before he improves."

  - sp: ELBOW
    o:
      - "He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him"
      - "warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if"
      - "he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were"
      - "as good go a mile on his errand."
    m:
      - "He has to appear before the deputy, sir, who’s already given him a warning. The deputy can’t stand pimps, and if he is a pimp, and appears before him, he would be better off being anywhere but there."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "That we were all, as some would seem to be,"
      - "From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!"
    m:
      - "If only we were all—as some of us seem to be—as free from sin as this pimp is from hypocrisy!"

  - sp: ELBOW
    o:
      - "His neck will come to your waist’—a cord, sir."
    m:
      - "Like your waist, his neck will soon have a rope around it, sir."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here’s a gentleman and a"
      - "friend of mine."
    m:
      - "I see help coming—and bail. Here’s a gentleman and a friend of mine."

  - os: "Enter LUCIO"
    ms: "LUCIO enters."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of"
      - "Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there"
      - "none of Pygmalion’s images, newly made woman, to be"
      - "had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and"
      - "extracting it clutch’d? What reply, ha? What"
      - "sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is’t"
      - "not drowned i’ the last rain, ha? What sayest"
      - "thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is"
      - "the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The"
      - "trick of it?"
    m:
      - "Hey there, noble Pompey! Oh dear, are you being paraded like a prisoner-of-war after the victorious Caesar’s chariot? What, aren’t there any more girls just turned women who can be had for a handful of dollars? Ha, don’t you have any answers? How do you feel about the new regime? Puts quite a damper on things, right? What do you say, old man? Hasn’t the world changed? What’s your mood nowadays, a bit sad and silent? Or how? What’s the plan?"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Still thus, and thus; still worse!"
    m:
      - "This is getting worse and worse."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she"
      - "still, ha?"
    m:
      - "How’s my sweetheart, your boss-lady? Is she still a madam?"

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is herself in the tub."
    m:
      - "Truthfully, sir, she’s worn out all her prostitutes, and is herself getting treated for an STD."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Why, ’tis good; it is the right of it; it must be"
      - "so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:"
      - "an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going"
      - "to prison, Pompey?"
    m:
      - "That’s right, that’s the way it goes: your fresh-faced whore ages into a heavily made-up madam. It’s unavoidable. Are you going to prison, Pompey?"

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "Yes, faith, sir."
    m:
      - "I am indeed, sir."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Why, ’tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I"
      - "sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?"
    m:
      - "Not a bad thing, Pompey. Goodbye. Go and say I sent you. For debt, Pompey? Or something else?"

  - sp: ELBOW
    o:
      - "For being a bawd, for being a bawd."
    m:
      - "For being a pimp, for being a pimp."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the"
      - "due of a bawd, why, ’tis his right: bawd is he"
      - "doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born."
      - "Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,"
      - "Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you"
      - "will keep the house."
    m:
      - "Well, then, put him in jail: if imprisonment is the punishment for being a pimp, then he deserves it. He’s undoubtedly a pimp, and has been for a long time. Born a pimp. Goodbye, good Pompey. Give my regards to prison. You’ll be a good husband now, Pompey—you’ll never leave home."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail."
    m:
      - "I hope, sir, you’ll post bail for me."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear."
      - "I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If"
      - "you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the"
      - "more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. ’Bless you, friar."
    m:
      - "No, I won’t, Pompey. It’s not in style now. I will pray, Pompey, to increase your sentence. Show an iron will while you’re in iron chains. *Adieu*, Pompey. God bless you, friar."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "And you."
    m:
      - "And you."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?"
    m:
      - "Does Bridget still get dolled up, Pompey, ha?"

  - sp: ELBOW
    o:
      - "Come your ways, sir; come."
    m:
      - "Come along, sir, come."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "You will not bail me, then, sir?"
    m:
      - "You won’t bail me out, then, sir?"

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?"
      - "what news?"
    m:
      - "Neither then, Pompey, nor now. What’s happening, friar? What’s the news?"

  - sp: ELBOW
    o:
      - "Come your ways, sir; come."
    m:
      - "Come along, sir, come."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Go to kennel, Pompey; go."
    m:
      - "Off to the doghouse, Pompey. Go."

  - os: "Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers"
    ms: "ELBOW, POMPEY, and officers exit."

  - o:
      - "What news, friar, of the duke?"
    m:
      - "Any news, friar, of the duke?"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "I know none. Can you tell me of any?"
    m:
      - "I don’t know anything. Can you tell me any news?"

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other"
      - "some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?"
    m:
      - "Some say he’s with the emperor of Russia. Others say that he’s in Rome. Where do you think he is?"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well."
    m:
      - "I don’t know, but wherever he is, I wish him well."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from"
      - "the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born"
      - "to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he"
      - "puts transgression to ’t."
    m:
      - "It was a crazy whim of his to sneak away from the city and pretend to be the commoner he was never born to be. Lord Angelo runs things well in his absence—he’s hard on criminals."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "He does well in ’t."
    m:
      - "He does a good job of it."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in"
      - "him: something too crabbed that way, friar."
    m:
      - "It wouldn’t hurt him to go a little easier on sex. There’s something too harsh in the way he’s handling that, friar."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it."
    m:
      - "It is too widespread a vice. It needs a severe cure."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;"
      - "it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp"
      - "it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put"
      - "down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and"
      - "woman after this downright way of creation: is it"
      - "true, think you?"
    m:
      - "Yes, to tell the truth, this is a vice a lot of people practice. But it’s impossible to stamp it out totally, friar. You’d have to stop people eating and drinking first. They say this Angelo wasn’t the result of a normal act between a man and woman. Do you think that’s true?"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "How should he be made, then?"
    m:
      - "What was he the result of, then?"

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he"
      - "was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is"
      - "certain that when he makes water his urine is"
      - "congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a"
      - "motion generative; that’s infallible."
    m:
      - "Some say a mermaid gave birth to him, some that he was conceived by two dried codfish. But it’s a fact that when he pees, his urine is congealed ice. That I know to be true. And he’s an impotent puppet—that’s certain."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace."
    m:
      - "You’re a funny guy, sir, and speak freely."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the"
      - "rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a"
      - "man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?"
      - "Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a"
      - "hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing"
      - "a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he"
      - "knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy."
    m:
      - "Well, what a cruel thing for him to do, to take a man’s life because his penis rose up! Would the absent duke have done something like this? Before he would’ve hanged a man for fathering a hundred bastards, he would’ve paid for nursing a thousand. He had some understanding of prostitution. He knew the game, and that made him merciful."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "I never heard the absent duke much detected for"
      - "women; he was not inclined that way."
    m:
      - "I never heard the absent duke accused of womanizing. He wasn’t inclined that way."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "O, sir, you are deceived."
    m:
      - "Oh, sir, you’re wrong."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "’Tis not possible."
    m:
      - "That’s not possible."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and"
      - "his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the"
      - "duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;"
      - "that let me inform you."
    m:
      - "Who, the duke? Yes, your fifty-year-old beggar-woman—he’d habitually make a deposit in her dish. The duke was a little kinky. He’d get drunk, too, let me tell you."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "You do him wrong, surely."
    m:
      - "Surely, you’re being unfair to him."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the"
      - "duke: and I believe I know the cause of his"
      - "withdrawing."
    m:
      - "Sir, I was a close friend of his. The duke was a shy fellow, and I believe I know the reason for his sudden departure."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "What, I prithee, might be the cause?"
    m:
      - "What, please tell me, was the reason?"

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "No, pardon; ’tis a secret must be locked within the"
      - "teeth and the lips: but this I can let you"
      - "understand, the greater file of the subject held the"
      - "duke to be wise."
    m:
      - "No, sorry. It’s a secret that must stay locked in my mouth. But this I can tell you: the majority of his subjects thought the duke a wise man."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Wise! why, no question but he was."
    m:
      - "Wise! Well, there’s no doubt that he was."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow."
    m:
      - "A very superficial, ignorant, thoughtless fellow."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:"
      - "the very stream of his life and the business he hath"
      - "helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better"
      - "proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own"
      - "bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the"
      - "envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier."
      - "Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your"
      - "knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice."
    m:
      - "You’re either jealous, mad, or mistaken. The way he conducts his life and his role as a ruler by themselves must earn him a better reputation. Judge him by his public actions and even the envious would see him as a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. So, you don’t know what you’re talking about. Or, if you do, you’re spitefully trying to tarnish his name."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Sir, I know him, and I love him."
    m:
      - "Sir, I know him, and I love him."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with"
      - "dearer love."
    m:
      - "If you loved him you would know him better, and if you knew him better you would love him more."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Come, sir, I know what I know."
    m:
      - "Look, sir, I know what I know."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "I can hardly believe that, since you know not what"
      - "you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our"
      - "prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your"
      - "answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,"
      - "you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call"
      - "upon you; and, I pray you, your name?"
    m:
      - "I can hardly believe that, since you don’t know what you’re talking about. But, if the duke ever returns, as we pray he will, I challenge you to justify your comments in front of him. If you’ve spoken the truth, you should have the courage to defend it. It’s my duty to summon you to testify. May I ask your name?"

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke."
    m:
      - "Sir, my name is Lucio, and it’s well known to the duke."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to"
      - "report you."
    m:
      - "He’ll know you even better, sir, if I live to report you."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "I fear you not."
    m:
      - "I’m not afraid of you."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you"
      - "imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I"
      - "can do you little harm; you’ll forswear this again."
    m:
      - "Oh, you hope the duke will never come back, or you think I’m too weak an enemy. But I really can do you a little harm—you’ll end up denying this."

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "I’ll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,"
      - "friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if"
      - "Claudio die to-morrow or no?"
    m:
      - "I’ll be hanged first. You’re wrong about me, friar. But forget all this. Can you tell me if Claudio is to die tomorrow or not?"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Why should he die, sir?"
    m:
      - "Why should he die, sir?"

  - sp: LUCIO
    o:
      - "Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would"
      - "the duke we talk of were returned again: the"
      - "ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with"
      - "continency; sparrows must not build in his"
      - "house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke"
      - "yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would"
      - "never bring them to light: would he were returned!"
      - "Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing."
      - "Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The"
      - "duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on"
      - "Fridays. He’s not past it yet, and I say to thee,"
      - "he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown"
      - "bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell."
    m:
      - "Why? For plugging a hole. I wish the duke were back again. His sexless deputy’s abstinence policy will depopulate the province. Even sparrows can’t nest on his roof, because they’re lecherous! The duke would have punished sexual acts privately—he’d never publicly expose them. I wish he were back! Claudio is condemned for getting undressed. Goodbye, good friar. Please pray for me. I tell you again, the duke was no choir boy—he would eat mutton on Fridays. He’s not past it yet, and I tell you, he’d French-kiss a beggar, even if she smelled of moldy bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Goodbye."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "No might nor greatness in mortality"
      - "Can censure ’scape; back-wounding calumny"
      - "The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong"
      - "Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?"
      - "But who comes here?"
    m:
      - "Neither political power nor noble character can escape criticism; even the most virtuous person can be stabbed in the back by slurs. What king is so strong he can bottle up the poison of a slandering tongue? But who’s coming now?"

  - os: "Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE"
    ms: "ESCALUS, the Provost, and officers enter with MISTRESS OVERDONE."

  - sp: ESCALUS
    o:

      - "a merciful man; good my lord."
    m:
      - "My good lord, be good to me. Your honor is said to be that of a merciful man, my good lord."

  - sp: ESCALUS
    o:
      - "Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in"
      - "the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play"
      - "the tyrant."
    m:
      - "You’ve been warned two, three times, and you’re still committing the same crime! This is enough to turn mercy itself into a cursing tyrant."

  - sp: PROVOST
    o:
      - "A bawd of eleven years’ continuance, may it please"
      - "your honour."
    m:

  - sp: MISTRESS OVERDONE
    o:
      - "My lord, this is one Lucio’s information against me."
      - "Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the"
      - "duke’s time; he promised her marriage: his child"
      - "is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:"
      - "I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!"
    m:
      - "My lord, this is Lucio’s accusation against me. He got Miss Kate Keepdown pregnant, back in the days when the duke was still here, and he promised to marry her. Now his child will be fifteen months old on May Day. I kept the kid myself, and now see how he goes out of his way to abuse me!"

  - sp: ESCALUS
    o:
      - "That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be"
      - "called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;"
      - "no more words."

      - "Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished"
      - "with divines, and have all charitable preparation."
      - "if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be"
      - "so with him."
    m:
      - "Provost, my colleague Angelo won’t change his mind—Claudio must die tomorrow. Furnish him with priests, to give him spiritual consolation. If my colleague possessed my sense of pity, this wouldn’t be happening."

  - sp: PROVOST
    o:
      - "So please you, this friar hath been with him, and"
      - "advised him for the entertainment of death."
    m:

  - sp: ESCALUS
    o:
      - "Of whence are you?"
    m:
      - "Where are you from?"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Not of this country, though my chance is now"
      - "To use it for my time: I am a brother"
      - "Of gracious order, late come from the See"
      - "In special business from his holiness."
    m:
      - "Not from this country, though I happen to be here for the time being. I belong to a holy brotherhood, and have just come from Rome, on special business from the Vatican."

  - sp: ESCALUS
    o:
      - "What news abroad i’ the world?"
    m:
      - "What’s the news from abroad?"

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "None, but that there is so great a fever on"
      - "goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:"
      - "novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous"
      - "to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous"
      - "to be inconstant in any undertaking. There is scarce"
      - "truth enough alive to make societies secure; but"
      - "security enough to make fellowships accurst: much"
      - "upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This"
      - "news is old enough, yet it is every day’s news. I"
      - "pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?"
    m:
      - "None, except that goodness is so sick that only death can cure it. People only want the latest thing, and it’s as dangerous to be faithful as it is virtuous to be promiscuous. There’s barely enough honesty left for it to be safe to get involved with people, but there’s enough blind trust to doom partnerships. The wisdom of the world runs on paradoxes like this. It’s old news, but everyday news. Tell me, sir, what sort of man was the duke?"

  - sp: ESCALUS
    o:
      - "One that, above all other strifes, contended"
      - "especially to know himself."
    m:
      - "Someone who, above everything else, truly wanted to know himself."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "What pleasure was he given to?"
    m:
      - "What sort of things did he enjoy?"

  - sp: ESCALUS
    o:
      - "Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at"
      - "any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a"
      - "gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to"
      - "his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;"
      - "and let me desire to know how you find Claudio"
      - "prepared. I am made to understand that you have"
      - "lent him visitation."
    m:
      - "He enjoyed seeing someone else happy more than doing something that made himself happy—an even-tempered man. But let’s leave him to his affairs, with a prayer that they’ll be prosperous, and tell me how Claudio is. I understand you’ve visited him."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "He professes to have received no sinister measure"
      - "from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself"
      - "to the determination of justice: yet had he framed"
      - "to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many"
      - "deceiving promises of life; which I by my good"
      - "leisure have discredited to him, and now is he"
      - "resolved to die."
    m:
      - "He claims to have received no unfair treatment from his judge, but willingly yields to the law’s verdict. Out of human weakness, he’d formed many deceptive hopes about a reprieve. But gradually I showed him these made no sense, and now he is ready to die."

  - sp: ESCALUS
    o:
      - "You have paid the heavens your function, and the"
      - "prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have"
      - "laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest"
      - "shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I"
      - "found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him"
      - "he is indeed Justice."
    m:
      - "You have fulfilled your duty to both God and the prisoner. I pleaded for the poor man as much as I could, without giving offense, but my fellow judge is so severe, I swear, he’s like Justice itself."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "If his own life answer the straitness of his"
      - "proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he"
      - "chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself."
    m:
      - "If his own behavior matches the strictness of his judgments, it’s to his credit. But if he slips, he’s written his own sentence."

  - sp: ESCALUS
    o:
      - "I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well."
    m:
      - "I’m going to visit the prisoner. Goodbye."

      - "Peace be with you!"
    m:

    ms: "ESCALUS and the Provost exit."

  - o:
      - "He who the sword of heaven will bear"
      - "Should be as holy as severe;"
      - "Pattern in himself to know,"
      - "Grace to stand, and virtue go;"
      - "More nor less to others paying"
      - "Than by self-offences weighing."
      - "Shame to him whose cruel striking"
      - "Kills for faults of his own liking!"
      - "Twice treble shame on Angelo,"
      - "To weed my vice and let his grow!"
      - "O, what may man within him hide,"
      - "Though angel on the outward side!"
      - "How may likeness made in crimes,"
      - "Making practise on the times,"
      - "To draw with idle spiders’ strings"
      - "Most ponderous and substantial things!"
      - "Craft against vice I must apply:"
      - "With Angelo to-night shall lie"
      - "His old betrothed but despised;"
      - "So disguise shall, by the disguised,"
      - "Pay with falsehood false exacting,"
      - "And perform an old contracting."
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* He who wants to be a ruler and enact heaven’s justice should be as holy as he is severe. He should find in himself a model of proper conduct, the grace to stand firm, and the strength to go forward, punishing others no more or less than he’d punish his own sins. Shame on him who cruelly strikes and kills others for the very faults he possesses! Shame on Angelo six times over, for weeding out my vice while nurturing his own! Oh, what evil an angelic-looking man can hide in himself! How this seemingly virtuous behavior, born out of sin, can deceive everyone! It’s like a spider web that traps small sins like small insects, but breaks when anything large and heavy touches it. I must combat vice with cunning. Tonight Angelo will sleep with his rejected, former fiancée. By deceit, the deceiver will be forced to pay for his wrongful demands, and fulfill his old contract."

    ms: "He exits."
