  - sp: QUEEN MARGARET
    o:
      - "So now prosperity begins to mellow"
      - "And drop into the rotten mouth of death."
      - "Here in these confines slyly have I lurked"
      - "To watch the waning of mine enemies."
      - "A dire induction am I witness to,"
      - "And will to France, hoping the consequence"
      - "Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical."
      - "Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes here?"
    m:
      - "So now the good times have ripened and grown rotten. I’ve lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies. I’ve been watching the terrible prologue to a scene that I hope will prove dark and tragic. I’ll head to France soon. It’s time to hide, wretched Margaret. Who’s coming?"

  - os: "She steps aside"
    ms: "She steps aside."

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "Ah, my poor princes! Ah, my tender babes,"
      - "My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets,"
      - "If yet your gentle souls fly in the air"
      - "And be not fixed in doom perpetual,"
      - "Hover about me with your airy wings"
      - "And hear your mother’s lamentation."
    m:
      - "Ah, my poor princes! Ah, my tender babes, my flowers who didn’t even get a chance to bloom. If your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever, hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mother’s lament."

  - sp: QUEEN MARGARET
    o:
      - "Hover about her; say that right for right"
      - "Hath dimmed your infant morn to agèd night."
    m:
      - "Hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved, with her children dead before their time."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "So many miseries have crazed my voice"
      - "That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute."
      - "Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?"
    m:
      - "I’ve been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute. Edward Plantagenet, why are you dead?"

  - sp: QUEEN MARGARET
    o:
      - "*(aside)* Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet;"
      - "Edward for Edward pays a dying debt."
    m:
      - "*(to herself)* One Plantagenet pays for the other. One Edward dies to pay a debt for the other Edward who died."

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs"
      - "And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?"
      - "When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?"
    m:
      - "Will you abandon such gentle lambs, God, and throw them to the wolves? Have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done?"

  - sp: QUEEN MARGARET
    o:
      - "*(aside)* When holy Harry died, and my sweet son."
    m:
      - "*(to herself)* Sure—when my husband, holy Harry, died and when my sweet son died."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "*(sitting down)*"
      - "Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost,"
      - "Woe’s scene, world’s shame, grave’s due by life usurped,"
      - "Brief abstract and record of tedious days,"
      - "Rest thy unrest on England’s lawful earth,"
      - "Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood."
    m:
      - "*(sitting down)* Sight has gone blind, life is as dead as a ghost. This is a mournful scene—it’s a shame to the world, when someone like me, who should have died long ago, still lives. As a short summary and record of an unbearable life, I’ll settle my restless bones on England’s lawful ground *(sitting down)*, which broke the law when it got drunk on the blood of the innocent!"

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "*(sitting down beside her)*"
      - "Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave"
      - "As thou canst yield a melancholy seat,"
      - "Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here."
      - "O, who hath any cause to mourn but we?"
    m:
      - "*(sitting down beside her)* Oh, if only the earth would offer me not just a seat for mourning but a grave. Then I would bury myself, not just rest my bones. Oh, who has any reason to mourn except us?"

  - sp: QUEEN MARGARET
    o:
      - "*(joining them)* If ancient sorrow be most reverend,"
      - "Give mine the benefit of seigniory,"
      - "And let my griefs frown on the upper hand."
      - "If sorrow can admit society,"
      - "Tell o’er your woes again by viewing mine."
      - "I had an Edward till a Richard killed him;"
      - "I had a husband till a Richard killed him."
      - "Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard killed him;"
      - "Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard killed him."
    m:
      - "If the oldest grief is the most revered, then mine should have the most weight here. Let my sorrow have the upper hand. If you can allow for comparison *(sitting down with them)*, consider your losses next to mine. I had an Edward till a Richard killed him, and I had a Harry till a Richard killed him. On your side, you had an Edward till a Richard killed him, and you had the young Richard, York, till a Richard killed him. So, I guess we’re equal."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "I had a Richard too, and thou did’st kill him;"
      - "I had a Rutland too; thou holp’st to kill him."
    m:
      - "I had a Richard too—namely, my husband—and you killed him. I had my son Rutland, and you helped kill him."

  - sp: QUEEN MARGARET
    o:
      - "Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard killed him"
      - "Then forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept"
      - "A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death—"
      - "That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,"
      - "To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood;"
      - "That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,"
      - "That reigns in gallèd eyes of weeping souls;"
      - "That foul defacer of God’s handiwork"
      - "Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves."
      - "O upright, just, and true-disposing God,"
      - "How do I thank thee that this carnal cur"
      - "Preys on the issue of his mother’s body"
      - "And makes her pew-fellow with others’ moan!"
    m:
      - "You had a Clarence, too, and Richard killed him. Your womb let loose a hellhound that hunts us all to death. That dog, who was born with sharp teeth for lapping up the blood of lambs, who had teeth before he even had eyes, is the world’s worst tyrant, making the eyes of a whole kingdom red with weeping. He destroys God’s handiwork and will send us to our graves. Oh righteous God, how can I thank you enough that this meat-eating mutt preys on his mother’s children and forces her to join others in their grief!"

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "O Harry’s wife, triumph not in my woes!"
      - "God witness with me, I have wept for thine."
    m:
      - "O Harry’s wife, do not triumph in my sorrow! With God as my witness, I swear I have wept for yours."

  - sp: QUEEN MARGARET
    o:
      - "Bear with me, I am hungry for revenge,"
      - "And now I cloy me with beholding it."
      - "Thy Edward he is dead, that killed my Edward,"
      - "Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;"
      - "Young York, he is but boot, because both they"
      - "Matched not the high perfection of my loss."
      - "Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward,"
      - "And the beholders of this frantic play,"
      - "Th’ adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,"
      - "Untimely smothered in their dusky graves."
      - "Richard yet lives, hell’s black intelligencer,"
      - "Only reserved their factor to buy souls"
      - "And send them thither. But at hand, at hand"
      - "Ensues his piteous and unpitied end."
      - "Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,"
      - "To have him suddenly conveyed from hence."
      - "Cancel his bond of life, dear God I pray,"
      - "That I may live to say, “The dog is dead.”"
    m:
      - "Bear with me. I am hungry for revenge, and now I plan to gorge myself on it. Your son Edward, who stabbed my son Edward, is dead. To even the balance, your grandson Edward is also dead, with young York thrown in because both your grandsons aren’t equal to my one son. Your Clarence, who stabbed my Edward, is also dead. And the audience to this insane play—the adulterer Hastings, as well as Rivers, Vaughan, and Grey—have been sent early to their graves. Richard, a fiendish spy for hell itself, still lives, but only long enough to buy souls to send below. Soon, very soon, he will meet his ghastly and well deserved end. When he dies, the earth will gape open, hell will burn hotter, devils will roar, and saints will pray to get him out of here fast. I pray that God ends his life before I die, so I can say, “The dog is dead!”"

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "O, thou didst prophesy the time would come"
      - "That I should wish for thee to help me curse"
      - "That bottled spider, that foul bunch-backed toad!"
    m:
      - "Oh, you prophesied that the time would come when I would want your help in cursing that humpbacked spider, that hideous toad!"

  - sp: QUEEN MARGARET
    o:
      - "I called thee then “vain flourish of my fortune.”"
      - "I called thee then poor shadow, “painted queen,”"
      - "The presentation of but what I was,"
      - "The flattering index of a direful pageant,"
      - "One heaved a-high, to be hurled down below,"
      - "A mother only mocked with two fair babes,"
      - "A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag"
      - "To be the aim of every dangerous shot,"
      - "A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,"
      - "A queen in jest, only to fill the scene."
      - "Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers?"
      - "Where are thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy?"
      - "Who sues and kneels and says “God save the queen?”"
      - "Where be the bending peers that flattered thee?"
      - "Where be the thronging troops that followed thee?"
      - "Decline all this, and see what now thou art:"
      - "For happy wife, a most distressèd widow;"
      - "For joyful mother, one that wails the name;"
      - "For queen, a very caitiff crowned with care;"
      - "For she that scorned at me, now scorned of me;"
      - "For she being feared of all, now fearing one;"
      - "For she commanding all, obeyed of none."
      - "Thus hath the course of justice whirled about"
      - "And left thee but a very prey to time,"
      - "Having no more but thought of what thou wast"
      - "To torture thee the more, being what thou art."
      - "Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not"
      - "Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?"
      - "Now thy proud neck bears half my burdened yoke,"
      - "From which even here I slip my weary head"
      - "And leave the burthen of it all on thee."
      - "Farewell, York’s wife, and queen of sad mischance."
      - "These English woes will make me smile in France."
    m:
      - "Back then, I called you “a poor, imitation queen,” a badly reproduced copy of what I was, a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow, a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell, a mother only teased with two beautiful children, who would soon die. I said you were a mere shadow of what a queen once was, a garish target to be aimed at again and again, an empty symbol of dignity without any substance, a mockery of a queen only there to fill in a role. And I was right, because where’s your husband now? Your brothers? Your two sons? Your source of joy? Who kneels at your feet now and says, “God save the Queen?” What noblemen are bowing and scraping to flatter you now? And where is your throng of followers? Once you’ve laid out all of these losses, it’s clear what’s left. In place of a happy wife, there’s a miserable widow. Instead of a joyful mother, here’s a woman who cries at the mention of her children. For one who bestows favors on others, here’s one who has to beg for favors. Instead of a queen, we have a poor woman with a crown of worries. She who mocked me now is mocked by me. She who once ordered everyone about is now obeyed by no one. Your fortune has fallen. Now you have only the memory of what you were, which tortures you when you consider what you’ve become. You once stole my position; now you get to have the grief that goes with it. Now like an ox, you carry half my heavy burden of grief—here, I’ll give you the rest. Farewell, York’s wife. Goodbye, queen of tragic misfortune. Your English sorrows will make me smile in France."

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "O, thou well-skilled in curses, stay awhile,"
      - "And teach me how to curse mine enemies."
    m:
      - "You who are so skilled in cursing, stay awhile and teach me how to curse my enemies."

  - sp: QUEEN MARGARET
    o:
      - "Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;"
      - "Compare dead happiness with living woe;"
      - "Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,"
      - "And he that slew them fouler than he is."
      - "Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse."
      - "Revolving this will teach thee how to curse."
    m:
      - "Don’t sleep at night, and don’t eat during the day. Compare what you’ve lost with what you suffer now. Remember your children as being sweeter than they actually were, and think of the man who killed them as worse than he is. Making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse. Think like this all day, and you’ll learn how to curse."

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "My words are dull. O, quicken them with thine!"
    m:
      - "My words are dull. Enliven them with yours!"

  - sp: QUEEN MARGARET
    o:
      - "Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine."
    m:
      - "Your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "She exits."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "Why should calamity be full of words?"
    m:
      - "What good does it do to respond to catastrophe with a lot of words?"

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "Windy attorneys to their clients’ woes,"
      - "Airy succeeders of intestate joys,"
      - "Poor breathing orators of miseries,"
      - "Let them have scope, though what they will impart"
      - "Help nothing else, yet do they ease the heart."
    m:
      - "Words are a lot of useless breath, like lawyers who won’t stop arguing for their sad clients, like a worthless inheritance, or like poor speech-makers who won’t stop speaking. But give words a chance. Though they won’t help in any other way, at least they make us feel better."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "If so, then be not tongue-tied. Go with me,"
      - "And in the breath of bitter words let’s smother"
      - "My damnèd son that thy two sweet sons smothered."
    m:
      - "If that’s true, then don’t be tongue-tied. Come with me, and let’s smother my fiendish son—who smothered your two sweet sons—in bitter words."

  - os: "A trumpet sounds"
    ms: "A trumpet plays."

  - o:
      - "The trumpet sounds. Be copious in exclaims."
    m:

    m:
      - "Who’s blocking the way?"

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "O, she that might have intercepted thee,"
      - "By strangling thee in her accursèd womb,"
      - "From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done."
    m:
      - "The woman who might have blocked you from all the murders you’ve committed by strangling you in her cursed womb."

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown"
      - "Where should be branded, if that right were right,"
      - "The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown"
      - "And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?"
      - "Tell me, thou villain-slave, where are my children?"
    m:
      - "Are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown, when, if there was any justice in this world, it should be branded with the murders you committed—your slaughter of the prince who held that crown, and of my sons and my brothers? Tell me, you villainous lowlife, where are my children?"

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?"
      - "And little Ned Plantagenet his son?"

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums!"
      - "Let not the heavens hear these telltale women"
      - "Rail on the Lord’s anointed. Strike, I say!"
    m:
      - "Play, trumpets! A call to arms, drums! Don’t let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lord’s anointed king. Play, I say!"

  - os: "Flourish. Alarums"
    ms: "Trumpet and drums play military music."

  - o:
      - "Either be patient and entreat me fair,"
      - "Or with the clamorous report of war"
      - "Thus will I drown your exclamations."
    m:
      - "Either be calm and polite or I’ll drown you out with the music of war."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Madam, I have a touch of your condition,"
      - "Which cannot brook the accent of reproof."
    m:
      - "Madam, I’m a bit like you in that I can’t tolerate a tone of disapproval."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "O, let me speak!"
    m:
      - "Oh, let me speak!"

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:

    o:
      - "I will be mild and gentle in my words."
    m:

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "And brief, good mother, for I am in haste."
    m:
      - "And brief, good mother—I’m in a hurry."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "Art thou so hasty? I have stayed for thee,"
      - "God knows, in torment and in agony."
    m:
      - "Are you that impatient? God knows I waited for you in anguish, pain, and agony when I gave birth to you."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "And came I not at last to comfort you?"
    m:
      - "And didn’t I finally arrive to comfort you?"

    o:
      - "No, by the Holy Rood, thou know’st it well."
      - "Thou cam’st on earth to make the earth my hell."
      - "A grievous burden was thy birth to me;"
      - "Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;"
      - "Thy school days frightful, desp’rate, wild, and furious;"
      - "Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;"
      - "Thy age confirmed, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,"
      - "More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred."
      - "What comfortable hour canst thou name,"
      - "That ever graced me in thy company?"
    m:
      - "No, by God, you know perfectly well you arrived on earth to make it my hell. Your birth was incredibly painful; you were a fussy and difficult baby; as a schoolboy, you were frightening, wild, furious, and caused me despair; as a young man, you were daring, bold, and enterprising, and in your maturity, you have been haughty, bloody, and treacherous—both more mild and more harmful than before. So, what hour of comfort have I ever had in your company? Name one."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Faith, none but Humfrey Hower, that called your Grace"
      - "To breakfast once, forth of my company."
      - "If I be so disgracious in your eye,"
      - "Let me march on and not offend you, madam.—"
      - "Strike up the drum."
    m:
      - "I guess none except Humphrey Hour, who once invited you to have breakfast without me. If I be such a disgrace in your eyes, let me march on and not offend you. Strike up the band!"

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "    I prithee, hear me speak."
    m:
      - "Please, listen to me."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "You speak too bitterly."
    m:
      - "You’re too bitter."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "    Hear me a word,"
      - "For I shall never speak to thee again."
    m:
      - "Just listen this once. I’ll never speak to you again."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "So."
    m:
      - "So be it."

  - sp: DUCHESS
    o:
      - "Either thou wilt die by God’s just ordinance"
      - "Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,"
      - "Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish"
      - "And nevermore behold thy face again."
      - "Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,"
      - "Which in the day of battle tire thee more"
      - "Than all the complete armor that thou wear’st."
      - "My prayers on the adverse party fight,"
      - "And there the little souls of Edward’s children"
      - "Whisper the spirits of thine enemies"
      - "And promise them success and victory."
      - "Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end."
      - "Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend."
    m:
      - "Either you will die as you should, before you’ve had a chance to win this battle, or *I* will die from grief and age and never look upon your face again. So, take with you my heaviest curse, which I hope wears you out in battle even more than your heavy suit of armor will. I pray that the little souls of Edward’s children will whisper to your enemies and promise them success and victory. You are violent, and your end will be violent. Your life was shameful, and let your death be, too."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "She exits."

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse"
      - "Abides in me. I say amen to her."
    m:
      - "Though I have far more reason, I don’t have as much energy to curse you. But I say amen to everything she said."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Stay, madam. I must talk a word with you."
    m:
      - "Wait, madam. I need to speak a word with you."

  - sp: QUEEN ELIZABETH
    o:
      - "I have no more sons of the royal blood"
      - "For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard,"
      - "They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens,"
      - "And therefore level not to hit their lives."
    m:
      - "I have no more royal sons for you to murder. As for my daughters, Richard, they will become praying nuns, not weeping queens. So don’t aim at them."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "You have a daughter called Elizabeth,"

If I took the kingdom from your sons, I’ll give it to your daughter to make up for it. If I have killed your children, I will have children with your daughter. A grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is. Your grandchildren will be just one step removed from your own children—they share your character, your blood, and require the same effort minus that one night of labor, like that which you suffered through for your own daughter. Your children caused you trouble in your youth, but mine will bring you comfort in your old age. The only loss you’ve had is that your son was not king. Because of that loss, your daughter will be queen. I can’t make up for everything that I’d like to, so accept such kindness as I can offer. Your son Dorset, who fled in fear to join an army in France against me, could come home to high promotions and great dignity. The king who calls your beautiful daughter “wife” will call Dorset “brother.” And you will be the mother to a king again, with all the miseries of unhappy times not just repaired, but also improved. Indeed, we have many good days to look forward to! The tears you have shed will be transformed into pearls. Your happiness will be like a loan that has grown through interest to ten times its original size. Go, then, mother, to your daughter. Give her the benefit of your experience, and prepare her to hear me court her. Make her aspire to be queen. Tell the princess about the sweet, silent hours of joy there are in marriage. And when my army has chastised the petty rebel, that stupid Buckingham, I will return wreathed in victory crowns and lead your daughter to a conqueror’s bed. She will be the only victor over my triumphs. She will be the ruler of a Caesar."

Don’t swear by the future, because you’ve ruined it before it has even arrived."

My happiness and yours lie in her. If I do not win her, death, desolation, and decay will descend on this land and on me, you, herself, and many a Christian soul. Ruin cannot be avoided unless I marry her. It *will not* be avoided unless I marry her. Therefore, good mother—I must call you that—advocate for me. Plead with your daughter about what I will be, not what I have been. Don’t talk about my just desserts but about what I *will* deserve. Tell her how necessary this marriage is at this time, and don’t be small-minded about such important plans."
