      - "*(to BASSANIO)* I pray you, tarry. Pause a day or two"
      - "Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong"
      - "I lose your company. Therefore forbear awhile."
      - "There’s something tells me—but it is not love—"
      - "I would not lose you, and you know yourself"
      - "Hate counsels not in such a quality."
      - "But lest you should not understand me well—"
      - "And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought—"
      - "I would detain you here some month or two"
      - "Before you venture for me. I could teach you"
      - "How to choose right, but I am then forsworn."
      - "So will I never be. So may you miss me."
      - "But if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin,"
      - "That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,"
      - "They have o’erlooked me and divided me."
      - "One half of me is yours, the other half yours—"
      - "Mine own, I would say. But if mine, then yours,"
      - "And so all yours. Oh, these naughty times"
      - "Put bars between the owners and their rights!"
      - "And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so."
      - "Let Fortune go to hell for it, not I."
      - "I speak too long, but ’tis to peize the time,"
      - "To eke it and to draw it out in length,"
      - "To stay you from election."
    m:
      - "*(to BASSANIO)* Please wait a day or two before making your choice. If you choose wrong, I’ll lose your company. So wait a while. Something tells me—not love, but something—that I don’t want to lose you, and you know that if I hated you I wouldn’t think that. But let me put it more clearly in case you don’t understand—though I know girls aren’t supposed to express their thoughts—I’m just saying I’d like you to stay here for a month or two before you undergo the test for me. I could tell you how to choose correctly, but then I’d be disregarding the oath I took. So I’ll never tell. But you might lose me by making the wrong choice. If you do choose wrong, you’ll make me wish for something very bad. I’d wish I had ignored my oath and told you everything. God, your eyes have bewitched me. They’ve divided me in two. One half of me is yours, and the other half—my own half, I’d call it—belongs to you too. If it’s mine, then it’s yours, and so I’m all yours. But in this awful day and age people don’t even have the right to their own property! So though I’m yours, I’m not yours. If there’s no chance for me to be yours, then it’s just bad luck. I know I’m talking too much, but I do that just to make the time last longer, and to postpone your test."

  - sp: BASSANIO
    o:
      - "None but that ugly treason of mistrust"
      - "Which makes me fear th’ enjoying of my love."
      - "There may as well be amity and life"
      - "’Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love."
    m:
      - "The only treason I’m guilty of is worrying that I’m never going to get to enjoy you. Treason has nothing at all to do with my love. They’re as opposite as hot and cold."

  - sp: PORTIA
    o:
      - "Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack"
      - "Where men enforcèd do speak anything."
    m:
      - "Hmmm, I’m not sure I believe what you’re saying. Men under torture will confess anything."

      - "Doth teach me answers for deliverance!"
      - "But let me to my fortune and the caskets."
    m:
      - "“Confess and love” is more like it. Oh, torture’s fun when my torturer tells me what I have to say to go free! But let me try my luck on the boxes."

  - sp: PORTIA
    o:
      - "Away, then. I am locked in one of them."
      - "If you do love me you will find me out.—"
      - "Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof."
      - "Let music sound while he doth make his choice."
      - "Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end,"
      - "Fading in music. That the comparison"
      - "May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream"
      - "And watery deathbed for him. He may win,"
      - "And what is music then? Then music is"
      - "Even as the flourish when true subjects bow"
      - "To a new-crownèd monarch. Such it is"
      - "As are those dulcet sounds in break of day"
      - "That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear"
      - "And summon him to marriage."
      - "    Now he goes"
      - "With no less presence but with much more love"
      - "Than young Alcides, when he did redeem"
      - "The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy"
      - "To the sea monster. I stand for sacrifice."
      - "The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,"
      - "With blearèd visages come forth to view"
      - "The issue of th’ exploit.—Go, Hercules!"
      - "Live thou, I live. With much, much more dismay"
      - "I view the fight than thou that makest the fray."
    m:
      - "Go ahead, then. I’m locked in one of them. If you really love me, you’ll find me.—Nerissa and the rest of you, get away from him. Play some music while he chooses. Then if he loses, it’ll be his swan song, music before the end. And since swans need water to swim in, I’ll cry him a river when he loses. But on the other hand, he may win. What music should we play then? If he wins, the music should be like the majestic trumpets that blare when subjects bow to a newly crowned monarch. It’s the sweet sounds at daybreak that the dreaming bridegroom hears on his wedding morning, calling him to the church. Bassanio’s walking to the boxes now. He looks as dignified as Hercules did when he saved the princess Hesione from the sea monster. But he loves me more than Hercules loved the princess. I’ll play Hesione, and everyone else will be the bystanders watching with tear-streaked faces. We’ve all come out to see what will happen.—Go, Hercules! If you survive, I’ll live. I’m more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself."

      - "And here choose I. Joy be the consequence!"
    m:
      - "You can’t always judge a book by its cover. People are often tricked by false appearances. In court, someone can deliver a false plea but hide its wickedness with a pretty voice. In religion, don’t serious men defend sins with Scripture, covering up evil with a show of good. Every sin in the world manages to make itself look good somehow. How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars, the god of war? Take another example: beauty. It can be bought by the ounce in makeup, which works miracles. Women who wear it the most are respected the least. It’s the same thing with hair. Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful. But you can buy that kind of hair as a wig, and wigs are made from dead people’s hair. Decoration’s nothing but a danger, meant to trick and trap the viewer. A lovely, cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea, just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty. Nowadays, everyone’s fooled by appearances. So I’ll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box—it’s like the gold that Midas couldn’t eat. And I’ll have nothing to do with the pale silver either, the metal that common coins are made of. But this humble lead one, though it looks too threatening to promise me anything good, moves me more than I can say. So this is the one I choose. I hope I’m happy with my choice!"

      - "*(opening the lead box)* What do we have here? A picture of beautiful Portia! What artist captured her likeness so well? Are these eyes moving? Or do they just seem to move as my eyes move? Her sweet breath forces her lips open, a lovely divider of lovely lips. And look at her hair, looking like a golden mesh to trap the hearts of men, like little flies in a cobweb. The painter was like a spider in creating it so delicately. But her eyes—how could he keep looking at them long enough to paint them? I would’ve expected that when he finished one of them, it would have enraptured him and kept him from painting the other. But I’m giving only faint praise of the picture, just as the picture, as good as it is, is only a faint imitation of the real woman herself. Here’s the scroll that sums up my fate:"

But I’m in a daze, like someone who’s just won a contest and thinks that all the applause and cheering is for him, but isn’t sure yet.

What you’re getting is an innocent and inexperienced girl. I’m happy that at least I’m not too old to learn new things. I’m even happier that I’m not stupid, and I can learn. I’m happiest of all that I’m yours now, my lord, my king, and you can guide me as you wish. Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you. Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion, master of these servants, and queen over myself. But as of right this second all these things are yours. With this ring I give them all to you. If you ever give away this ring or lose it, it means our love’s doomed, and I’ll have a right to be angry with you. *(she gives BASSANIO the ring)*"

You fell in love with Portia, and I fell in love with Nerissa, because I’m not in the habit of delaying any more than you are, my lord. Your fate depended on those boxes, and it turns out that mine did too. I couldn’t help but chase her. I started making love vows to her till my mouth was dry.

      - "To come with him along."
    m:
      - "*(to BASSANIO)* Thank you, sir. I didn’t intend to come see you. But I ran into Salerio on the way, and he begged me to come along with him until I couldn’t say no."

      - "I know he will be glad of our success."
      - "We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece."
    m:
      - "*(pointing at JESSICA)* Nerissa, welcome this stranger. —Salerio, welcome. Any news from Venice? How’s the great merchant Antonio doing? I know he’ll be happy to hear of our success. We’re like the ancient hero Jason, we went looking for the Golden Fleece and we won it!"

      - "And I must freely have the half of anything"
      - "That this same paper brings you."
    m:
      - "Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale. Some good friend of his must have died, because nothing else in the world could change a man so much. What, does the news only get worse?—Please, Bassanio, I’m half of you, so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you."

  - sp: BASSANIO
    o:
      - "    O sweet Portia,"

      - "When I did first impart my love to you,"
      - "I freely told you, all the wealth I had"

      - "How much I was a braggart. When I told you"
      - "My state was nothing, I should then have told you"
      - "That I was worse than nothing, for indeed"
      - "I have engaged myself to a dear friend,"
      - "Engaged my friend to his mere enemy"
      - "To feed my means."
      - "  Here is a letter, lady,"
      - "The paper as the body of my friend,"
      - "And every word in it a gaping wound,"
      - "Issuing life blood.—But is it true, Salerio?"
      - "Have all his ventures failed? What, not one hit?"
      - "From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,"
      - "From Lisbon, Barbary, and India?"
      - "And not one vessel ’scape the dreadful touch"
      - "Of merchant-marring rocks?"
    m:
      - "Oh Portia, these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper. My darling, when I gave my love to you, I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins—that I have noble blood, but no money. When I said that, I told you the truth. But my dear, when I said I was worth nothing, I was actually bragging—I should’ve said that I was worse than nothing. I’ve borrowed money from a dear friend who in turn borrowed money from his mortal enemy for my sake. Here’s a letter, my dear. The paper’s like my friend’s body, and every word in it is a bleeding wound on that body.—But is it true, Salerio? Have all his business ventures failed? Not even one success? He had ships to Tripolis, Mexico, England, Lisbon, North Africa, and India, and not one of these ships avoided the rocks?"

  - sp: SALERIO
    o:
      - "    Not one, my lord."
      - "Besides, it should appear that if he had"
      - "The present money to discharge the Jew,"
      - "He would not take it. Never did I know"
      - "A creature that did bear the shape of man"
      - "So keen and greedy to confound a man."
      - "He plies the duke at morning and at night,"
      - "And doth impeach the freedom of the state"
      - "If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,"
      - "The duke himself, and the magnificoes"
      - "Of greatest port have all persuaded with him."
      - "But none can drive him from the envious plea"
      - "Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond."
    m:
      - "Not one, my lord. Anyway, even if he had the money now, the Jew probably wouldn’t take it. I’ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man. He’s at the duke’s morning and night, accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice. Twenty merchants, the duke himself, and the highest-ranking Venetian nobles have all tried to persuade him to forget his contract, but nobody can do it. He’s determined to get the penalty specified in his contract with Antonio."

    m:
      - "When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush, his countrymen, that he’d rather have Antonio’s flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio owed. And I know that unless the law intervenes, it’ll be bad news for poor Antonio."

      - "But let me hear the letter of your friend."
    m:
      - "What, that’s all? Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt. I’d pay twelve thousand before I’d let a friend like that suffer in the slightest because of you. First come with me to church to get married. Then you can leave for Venice to see your friend. You have to go, because you’ll never sleep next to me peacefully without settling this. I’ll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over. When it’s paid, bring your friend back. Until you get back, Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows. Come on, let’s go, because you’re going to leave me the same day we get married. Put on a happy face, and welcome your friends. Since it’s costing me a lot to marry you, I’ll think of you as even more precious. But let me hear the letter from your friend."

And since in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are cleared between you and I if I might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure. If your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.”"
    m:
      - "*(he reads)* “Dear Bassanio, my ships have all been wrecked. My creditors are getting mean. My money’s almost run out. I couldn’t pay my debt to the Jew on the due date. Since I’ll certainly die when he takes his collateral out of my flesh, all debts are cleared between you and me if I can just see you again before I die. In any case, do what you want. If your affection for me doesn’t convince you to come, don’t let my letter do so.”"
