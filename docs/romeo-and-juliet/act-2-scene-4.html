<p>If he says anything against me, I’ll humble him, even if he were stronger than he is—and twenty punks like him. If I can’t do it myself, I’ll find someone who can. That dirty rat! I’m not one of his sluts. I’m not one of his punk friends who carries a knife. <em>(to PETER)</em> And you just stand there letting every jerk make fun of me for kicks.</p>

<p>Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy knave!</p>
<p><em>(to ROMEO)</em> Pray you, sir, a word. And as I told you, my young lady bid me inquire you out. What she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into a fool’s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For the gentlewoman is young, and therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.</p>

<p>Now, I swear, I’m so angry that I’m shaking all over. That rotten scoundrel! <em>(to ROMEO)</em> Now, please, may I have a word with you, sir? My young mistress asked me to find you. What she asked me to say I’ll keep to myself. But let me tell you this first. If you lead her into a fool’s paradise, as the saying goes, it would be an outrageous crime because the girl is so young. And if you try to trick her, it would be an evil thing to do to any woman and very poor behavior.</p>
