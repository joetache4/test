    o:
      - "Can it be possible that no man saw them?"

      - "Are of consent and sufferance in this."
    m:
      - "Can it be possible that no one saw them leave? It cannot be. Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen."

    o:
      - "My lord, the roinish clown, at whom so oft"

      - "And she believes wherever they are gone"
      - "That youth is surely in their company."
    m:
      - "My lord, that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing. Hisperia, the princess’ gentlewoman, confesses that she overheard your daughter and her cousin praising the good looks and skills of the wrestler who recently beat the muscular Charles. Hisperia believes that, wherever they have gone, that young man is likely with them."

      - "To bring again these foolish runaways."
    m:
      - "Send a message to his brother. Bring that swinger Orlando here. If he’s not around, bring his brother Oliver to me. I’ll make Oliver find him. Do this immediately, and don’t stop searching and interrogating until you’ve brought home these foolish runaways."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They all exit."
