  - os: "DESDEMONA asleep in bed Enter OTHELLO with a light"
    ms: "DESDEMONA is asleep in bed. OTHELLO enters with a candle."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul."
      - "Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars,"
      - "It is the cause. Yet I’ll not shed her blood,"
      - "Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow"
      - "And smooth as monumental alabaster."
      - "Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men."
      - "Put out the light, and then put out the light."
      - "If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,"
      - "I can again thy former light restore"
      - "Should I repent me. But once put out thy light,"
      - "Thou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature,"
      - "I know not where is that Promethean heat"
      - "That can thy light relume. When I have plucked thy rose"
      - "I cannot give it vital growth again,"
      - "It must needs wither. I’ll smell thee on the tree."
      - "Oh, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade"
      - "Justice to break her sword! One more, one more."
      - "Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee"
      - "And love thee after. *(kissing her)* One more, and that’s the last."
      - "So sweet was ne’er so fatal. I must weep,"
      - "But they are cruel tears. This sorrow’s heavenly,"
      - "It strikes where it doth love. She wakes."
    m:
      - "I have to do it, I have to do it. I have to keep my reason in mind. I won’t say out loud what my reason is, but I have to do it. But I won’t shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin, whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble. But she’s got to die, or she’ll cheat on other men. Put out the light of the candle, and then put out the light of her heart. If I extinguish the candle, I can light it again if I regret it. But once I kill you, you beautiful, fake woman, I do not know the magic that could bring you back. When I’ve plucked this rose, I can’t make it grow again; it will have no choice but to wither and die. Let me smell you while you’re still on the tree. *(he kisses her)* Oh, that sweet breath almost convinces me not to kill you and carry out justice. One more, one more kiss. If you’re this beautiful when you’re dead, I’ll kill you and then love you afterward. *(kissing her)* One more, and this is the last. Such a sweet kiss was never so deadly. I have to cry, but I have to be cruel too. I’m acting like God in the Old Testament—I have to punish the one I love. She’s waking up."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Ay, Desdemona."
    m:

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Will you come to bed, my lord?"
    m:

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Have you prayed tonight, Desdemon?"
    m:
      - "Have you said your prayers tonight, Desdemona?"

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Ay, my lord."
    m:

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "If you bethink yourself of any crime"
      - "Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,"
      - "Solicit for it straight."
    m:
      - "If you can think of any crime you haven’t confessed, then pray for forgiveness right away."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Alack, my lord, what do you mean by that?"
    m:
      - "Oh, my lord, what do you mean by that?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Well, do it, and be brief. I will walk by."
      - "I would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit."
      - "No, heavens forfend, I would not kill thy soul!"
    m:
      - "Well, hurry up and confess. Be quick about it. I’ll wait over here. I don’t want to kill you before you’ve readied your soul. No, I don’t want to send your soul to hell when I kill you."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Talk you of killing?"
    m:
      - "You’re talking about killing?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "  Ay, I do."
    m:
      - "Yes, I am."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "    Then heaven"
      - "Have mercy on me!"
    m:
      - "Then heaven have mercy on me."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Amen, with all my heart."
    m:
      - "Amen to that, from the bottom of my heart."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "If you say, I hope you will not kill me."
    m:
      - "If you really feel that way, then I hope you won’t kill me."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Humh!"
    m:
      - "Hmmph!"

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "And yet I fear you, for you’re fatal then"
      - "When your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know not,"
      - "Since guiltiness I know not. But yet I feel I fear."
    m:
      - "You’re scaring me. You terrify me when you have that look in your eyes. I don’t know why I should be afraid, since I haven’t done anything wrong. But I’m still afraid."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Think on thy sins."
    m:
      - "Think of your sins."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "They are loves I bear to you."
    m:
      - "My only sin was loving you too much."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Ay, and for that thou diest."
    m:
      - "Yes, that’s why you have to die."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "That death’s unnatural that kills for loving."
      - "Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?"
      - "Some bloody passion shakes your very frame."
      - "These are portents, but yet I hope, I hope"
      - "They do not point on me."
    m:
      - "You’re wrong to kill me for loving you. Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that? You’re shaking with emotion. These are bad omens, but I hope, I hope, they don’t predict my future."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    Peace, and be still."
    m:
      - "Quiet. Stay still."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "I will so. What’s the matter?"
    m:
      - "I will. What’s this all about?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "That handkerchief"
      - "Which I so loved and gave thee, thou gav’st"
      - "To Cassio."
    m:
      - "You gave that handkerchief, the one I loved and gave to you, to Cassio."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "No, by my life and soul!"
      - "Send for the man and ask him."
    m:
      - "No, I swear by my life and soul! Bring him here and ask him."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Sweet soul, take heed, take heed of perjury."
      - "Thou art on thy deathbed."
    m:
      - "My sweet darling, don’t lie. You’re on your deathbed."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Ay—but not yet to die!"
    m:
      - "I am? But I’m not dying yet!"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Presently."
      - "Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin,"
      - "For to deny each article with oath"
      - "Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception"
      - "That I do groan withal. Thou art to die."
    m:
      - "Yes, right now. So confess your sin freely now. Even if you swear you’re innocent of every accusation, you won’t change my mind or remove the thought that’s tormenting me. You’re going to die."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Oh, heaven have mercy on me!"
    m:
      - "Then heaven have mercy on me!"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    I say “amen.”"
    m:
      - "Amen to that."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "And have you mercy too! I never did"
      - "Offend you in my life, never loved Cassio"
      - "But with such general warranty of heaven"
      - "As I might love. I never gave him token."
    m:
      - "And you have mercy on me too! I never did anything wrong to you in my life. I never loved Cassio, except with the pure love that I feel for humankind. I never gave him any token of romantic love."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in ’s hand."
      - "O perjured woman, thou dost stone my heart,"
      - "And mak’st me call what I intend to do"
      - "A murder, which I thought a sacrifice!"
      - "I saw the handkerchief."
    m:
      - "I saw him holding the handkerchief! You liar, you’re turning my heart to stone, and making me call what I’ll do murder, when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice! I saw the handkerchief."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "    He found it then,"
      - "I never gave it him. Send for him hither,"
      - "Let him confess a truth."
    m:
      - "He found it somewhere, then. I never gave it to him. Tell him to come here. He’ll tell the truth."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "    He hath confessed."
    m:
      - "He’s already done so."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "What, my lord?"
    m:
      - "What, my lord?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "  That he hath usèd thee."
    m:
      - "That he had sex with you."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "How? Unlawfully?"
    m:
      - "What? Had sex with me?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Ay."
    m:
      - "Yes."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "He will not say so."
    m:
      - "He wouldn’t say that."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "No, his mouth is stopped. Honest Iago"
      - "Hath ta’en order for ’t."
    m:
      - "No. He won’t say anything anymore. Honest Iago’s arranged that."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Oh! My fear interprets. What, is he dead?"
    m:
      - "Oh, I’m scared. What, is he dead?"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Had all his hairs been lives"
      - "My great revenge had stomach for them all."
    m:
      - "If he had as many lives as he’s got hairs on his head, I would’ve killed them all in revenge."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Alas, he is betrayed and I undone."
    m:
      - "Oh, he’s been betrayed, and I’ve been ruined."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Out, strumpet! weep’st thou for him to my face?"
    m:
      - "What, you whore, are you crying for him right in front of me?"

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "Oh, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!"
    m:
      - "Send me away, my lord, but don’t kill me!"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Down, strumpet!"
    m:
      - "Down, whore!"

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:

    m:
      - "Kill me tomorrow—but let me live tonight."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Nay, if you strive—"
    m:
      - "No, if you struggle with me—"

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "But half an hour!"
    m:
      - "Just half an hour!"

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Being done, there is no pause."
    m:
      - "While I’m doing this, I can’t pause for a moment."

  - sp: DESDEMONA
    o:
      - "But while I say one prayer!"
    m:
      - "Just let me say one prayer!"

  - sp: OTHELLO

    o:

      - "I that am cruel am yet merciful,"
      - "I would not have thee linger in thy pain."
      - "So, so."
    m:
      - "What’s that noise? Aren’t you dead yet? I know I’m cruel, but I’m merciful too. I don’t want you to linger in pain."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Yes, ’tis Emilia.—*(to EMILIA)* By and by.—She’s dead.—"
      - "’Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death,"
      - "The noise was high. Ha! No more moving?"
      - "Still as the grave. Shall she come in? Were ’t good?"
      - "I think she stirs again—No. What’s best to do?"
      - "If she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife—"
      - "My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife."
      - "Oh, insupportable! Oh, heavy hour!"
      - "Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse"
      - "Of sun and moon, and that th’ affrighted globe"
      - "Should yawn at alteration."
    m:
      - "Yes, it’s Emilia.*(to EMILIA)*—Just a minute!—She’s dead now.—Emilia’s probably come to tell me that Cassio’s been killed. The fight outside was loud. So! You’re not moving anymore? No, you’re as still as a grave. Should I let her in? Is that a good idea? I think she’s moving again—No. What should I do? If she comes in, she’ll try to speak to my wife. My wife, my wife! What wife? I don’t have a wife. Oh, this is unbearable! Oh, the horror! There should be a huge eclipse of the sun and the moon, now that Desdemona’s no longer on this earth."

  - sp: EMILIA
    o:

      - "Soft, by and by. Let me the curtains draw."
      - "Where art thou?"
    m:

  - sp: EMILIA
    o:

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "It is the very error of the moon,"
      - "She comes more nearer earth than she was wont"
      - "And makes men mad."
    m:
      - "It’s because of the full moon. It comes too close to the earth and drives men crazy."

  - sp: OTHELLO
    o:
      - "Not Cassio killed! Then murder’s out of tune,"
      - "And sweet revenge grows harsh."
    m:

    m:

      - "Oh, I were damned beneath all depth in hell,"

      - "To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all."
    m:
      - "Cassio had sex with her. Ask your husband if you doubt me. If I didn’t have a good reason to do this, damn me to the very bottom of hell. Your husband knew about everything."

      - "If heaven would make me such another world"
      - "Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,"
      - "I’d not have sold her for it."
    m:
      - "Yes, with Cassio. If she’d been faithful to me, I never would have given her up, not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her."

      - "An honest man he is, and hates the slime"
      - "That sticks on filthy deeds."

As for this slave, Iago, if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time, he’ll have it. You’ll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian government.—Okay, take him away."

    m:
      - "Wait. A word or two before you go. I’ve given the state of Venice a bit of help in the past, and they know it. But enough about that. When you record these sad events in your letters, please describe me exactly as I am. Don’t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility. If you’re being fair, you’ll have to describe me as someone who loved too much, but who wasn’t wise about it. I was not easily made jealous, but once I was tricked and manipulated, I worked myself into a frenzy. Describe me as a fool who threw away a precious pearl with his own hands, like a silly Indian who didn’t know what it was worth. As someone who was not emotional, but who then cried a lot. Write all this down, and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian, so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this."
