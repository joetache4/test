    o:
      - "Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter."
      - "The tyranny of the open night’s too rough"
      - "For nature to endure."
    m:
      - "Here’s the hut, my lord. Please go inside. The night’s too rough for humans to bear."

  - os: "Storm still"
    ms: "The storm continues."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "  Let me alone."
    m:
      - "Leave me for a bit."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Good my lord, enter here."
    m:
      - "My lord, here is the entrance."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:

    o:

    o:
      - "Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm"
      - "Invades us to the skin. So ’tis to thee."
      - "But where the greater malady is fixed"
      - "The lesser is scarce felt. Thou’dst shun a bear,"
      - "But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea"
      - "Thou’dst meet the bear i’ th’ mouth. When the mind’s free,"
      - "The body’s delicate. The tempest in my mind"
      - "Doth from my senses take all feeling else"
      - "Save what beats there—filial ingratitude."
      - "Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand"
      - "For lifting food to ’t? But I will punish home."
      - "No, I will weep no more. In such a night"
      - "To shut me out! Pour on, I will endure."
      - "In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril,"
      - "Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all—"
      - "Oh, that way madness lies. Let me shun that."
      - "No more of that."
    m:
      - "You think it’s a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin. It’s a big deal to you. But whenever you feel a larger pain, the smaller one disappears. You would run away from a bear, but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean, you’d turn around and confront the bear. When your mind is at peace, your body is sensitive to the elements. But this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what’s tormenting me—how ungrateful my children are! Isn’t their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it? But I’ll punish them thoroughly. No, I won’t cry any more. Imagine them locking me out on a night like this! But let it rain; I’ll survive. On a night like this! Oh, Regan, Goneril, your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything—Oh, if I think about that I’ll go mad. I want to avoid that. No more of these thoughts."

      - "On things would hurt me more. But I’ll go in."
      - "*(to FOOL)* In, boy. Go first. You houseless poverty—"
      - "Nay, get thee in. I’ll pray, and then I’ll sleep."
    m:
      - "Go inside yourself. Make yourself comfortable. This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more. But I’ll go in. *(to FOOL)* You go in first, boy. Oh, you suffering homeless people—No, you go in. I’ll pray first, then I’ll sleep."

  - os: "Exit FOOL"
    ms: "The FOOL exits."

  - o:
      - "Poor naked wretches, whereso’er you are,"
      - "That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,"
      - "How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,"
      - "Your looped and windowed raggedness, defend you"
      - "From seasons such as these? Oh, I have ta’en"
      - "Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp."
      - "Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,"
      - "That thou mayst shake the superflux to them"

    m:
      - "Poor homeless creatures suffering this storm, wherever you are, how will you survive a night like this with no roof over your heads, no fat on your sides to keep you warm, and only rags for clothes? When I was king I didn’t do enough to help you. Powerful men, take your medicine by learning about hardship. Go out and feel what the impoverished feel. Then you can give them your extra wealth and make the world more fair."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Didst thou give all to thy two daughters, and art thou come to this?"
    m:
      - "Did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this?"

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:
      - "Who gives any thing to Poor Tom, whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlipool, o’er bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him proud of heart to ride on a bay trotting- horse over four-inched bridges to course his own shadow for a traitor? Bless thy five wits. Tom’s a-cold. Oh, do-de, do-de, do-de. Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do Poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now—and there—and there again—and there."
    m:
      - "Whoever gave a thing to Poor Tom? The devil has chased him through fires, across rivers and whirlpools, and over swamps. The devil has put knives under Tom’s pillow and hangman’s ropes in his church pew, encouraging him to kill himself. The devil has put rat poison next to Poor Tom’s oatmeal and made him gallop his horse over narrow bridges, chasing his own shadow as if it were a traitor. Bless your five senses! Tom’s chilly. Oh do-de, do-de, do-de. God protect you from tornadoes, evil stars, and diseases! Take pity on Poor Tom, who is persecuted by the devil. I can almost catch him. There!… And over there!… And over there!"

    m:

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed."
    m:
      - "No, he kept a blanket to cover himself with. If he hadn’t, we’d all be embarrassed to look at him."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air"
      - "Hang fated o’er men’s faults light on thy daughters!"
    m:
      - "Then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners!"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "He hath no daughters, sir."
    m:
      - "He doesn’t have any daughters, sir."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Death, traitor! Nothing could have subdued nature"
      - "To such a lowness but his unkind daughters."
      - "Is it the fashion that discarded fathers"
      - "Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?"
      - "Judicious punishment! ’Twas this flesh begot"
      - "Those pelican daughters."
    m:
      - "Like hell! Nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this. Is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity? That’s a fair punishment! I’m the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters."

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:

    m:
      - "Beware of the devil. Obey your parents, keep your word, don’t swear, don’t sleep with another man’s wife, and don’t covet flashy clothes. Tom’s chilly."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "What hast thou been?"
    m:
      - "What were you before this?"

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:
      - "A servingman, proud in heart and mind, that curled my hair, wore gloves in my cap, served the lust of my mistress’ heart and did the act of darkness with her, swore as many oaths as I spake words and broke them in the sweet face of heaven—one that slept in the contriving of lust and waked to do it. Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in woman outparamoured the Turk. False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand—hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey. Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen from lenders’ books, and defy the foul fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind, says, “Suum, mun, nonny.” Dauphin my boy, my boy, cessez. Let him trot by."
    m:
      - "I used to be an honorable devoted servant who curled his hair, wore his mistress’ glove in his hat as a token of her affection, and slept with his mistress whenever she wanted. I swore oaths with every other word out of my mouth, and broke the oaths shamelessly. I used to dream of having sex and wake up to do it. I loved wine and gambling, and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem. I was disloyal and violent. I eavesdropped. I was as lazy as a hog, as sneaky as a fox, as greedy as a wolf, as mad as a dog, and as ruthless as a lion. Don’t ever let a woman know what you’re thinking. Stay away from whores, don’t chase skirts, don’t borrow money, and resist the devil. The cold wind’s still blowing through the hawthorn tree. *(speaking to an imaginary horse)* Dauphin, my boy, stop that.—Let the horse go by."

  - os: "Storm still"
    ms: "The storm continues."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.—Is man no more than this? Consider him well.—Thou owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! Here’s three on ’s are sophisticated. Thou art the thing itself."
      - "Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art.—"
      - "Off, off, you lendings! Come. Unbutton here. *(tears at his clothes)*"
    m:
      - "You’d be better off dead than facing the storm as naked as you are. Is this all a human being is? Look at him. *(to EDGAR)* You are not indebted to animals for your clothes since don’t wear silk, leather, or wool—not even perfume. Ha! The three of us are sophisticated compared to you. You’re the real thing."
      - "The human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor, naked, two-legged animal like you."
      - "Off with these clothes borrowed from animals! Let me unbutton this. *(he tears at his clothes)*"

    o:

    m:
      - "Please calm down, uncle. This is a nasty night to go swimming. On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man—a tiny spark in a cold body. Look, here comes a walking fire."

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:
      - "This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. He begins at curfew and walks till the first cock. He gives the web and the pin, squints the eye and makes the harelip, mildews the white wheat and hurts the poor creature of earth."
      - "Swithold footed thrice the ’old."

    m:

      - "He met a she-demon and her nine kids,"

But mice and rats and such small deer Have been Tom’s food for seven long year. Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin. Peace, thou fiend!"
    m:
      - "Poor Tom, who eats frogs, toads, tadpoles, lizards, and newts. When the devil tells me to, I eat cow dung for salads, I swallow old rats and dead dogs, I drink pond scum. In every village I’m whipped and put in the stocks, punished and imprisoned. But I used to be a respectable servant, with three suits and six shirts. Once I had a horse to ride and a sword to wear, but now poor Tom’s been eating rats and mice for seven long years. Beware of the devil who follows me around. Calm down, Smulkin, you fiend!"

I had a son, whom I’ve legally disowned. He tried to kill me recently, very recently. I loved him, as much as any father ever loved his son. To tell you the truth, I’m crazed with grief.
