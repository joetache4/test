  - os: "Enter MARIA and the FOOL"
    ms: "MARIA and the FOOL enter."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse. My lady will hang thee for thy absence."
    m:
      - "No. Either tell me where you’ve been, or I won’t make any excuses for you to Lady Olivia. Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Let her hang me. He that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colors."
    m:
      - "So let her execute me. Anyone who’s executed doesn’t have to be afraid of anything he sees."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Make that good."
    m:
      - "How do you know?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "He shall see none to fear."
    m:
      - "Well, he’ll be dead, so he won’t see anything."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "A good lenten answer. I can tell thee where that saying was born, of “I fear no colors.”"
    m:
      - "That’s a lame answer. By the way, I know where you get all your brave talk about not being afraid of anything."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Where, good Mistress Mary?"
    m:
      - "Where, good Miss Mary?"

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "In the wars. And that may you be bold to say in your foolery."
    m:
      - "From soldiers. But you’ll never see the front lines. It’s easy for you to talk about bravery, working as a fool in this palace."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Well, God give them wisdom that have it. And those that are fools, let them use their talents."
    m:
      - "Well, we all have our special gifts. Some people are born wise; those of us who were meant to be fools should do what they do best."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent. Or to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?"
    m:
      - "But still, she’s going to kill you for being gone so long. Or at least fire you. And wouldn’t that be as bad for you as being killed?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage, and, for turning away, let summer bear it out."
    m:
      - "Sometimes getting killed is a good way to avoid getting married. And as for being fired, it’s summer, so it won’t be that bad to be homeless."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "You are resolute, then?"
    m:
      - "You’ve made up your mind, then?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points."
    m:
      - "No, but I’ve made up my mind on two points."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "That if one break, the other will hold. Or, if both break, your gaskins fall."
    m:
      - "Ah yes, the two points where your suspenders are attached to your buttons. If one breaks, the other will hold, but if both points break, your pants will fall down."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Apt, in good faith, very apt. Well, go thy way. If Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve’s flesh as any in Illyria."
    m:
      - "Clever, very clever. Well, go along now. You’d be the funniest person in Illyria… if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Peace, you rogue, no more o’ that. Here comes my lady."
      - "Make your excuse wisely, you were best."
    m:
      - "Shut up, you troublemaker, no more of that. Here comes my lady. If you know what’s good for you, you’ll think up some good excuse for being away so long."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "MARIA exits."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "*(aside)* Wit, an ’t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft prove fools. And I, that am sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? “Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.”"
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* Please, let me think of something funny to say now! Smart people who think they’re witty often turn out to be fools, but I know I’m not witty, so I might pass for smart. What did that philosopher Quinapalus say? Ah yes, “A witty fool’s better than a foolish wit.”"

  - os: "Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO with attendants"
    ms: "OLIVIA enters with MALVOLIO and attendants."

  - o:
      - "God bless thee, lady!"
    m:
      - "Greetings to you, madam!"

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Take the fool away."
    m:
      - "Get that fool out of here."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady."
    m:
      - "Didn’t you hear her, guys? Get the lady out of here."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Go to, you’re a dry fool. I’ll no more of you. Besides, you grow dishonest."
    m:
      - "Oh, go away, you’re a boring fool. I don’t want to have anything to do with you anymore. Besides, you’ve gotten unreliable."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend. For give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry. Bid the dishonest man mend himself. If he mend, he is no longer dishonest. If he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that’s mended is but patched. Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so. If it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty’s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool. Therefore, I say again, take her away."
    m:
      - "Madam, those are two character flaws that a little booze and some common sense can fix. If you hand a drink to a sober fool, he won’t be thirsty anymore. If you tell a bad man to mend his wicked ways, and he does, he won’t be bad anymore. If he cannot, let the tailor mend him. Anything that’s mended is only patched up. A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin. And a sinner who does something good is only patched up with goodness. If this logic works, that’s great. If not, what can you do about it? Since the only real betrayed husband in the world is the one deserted by Lady Luck—because we’re all married to her—beauty is a flower. The lady gave orders to take away the fool, so I’m telling you again, take her away."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Sir, I bade them take away you."
    m:
      - "I told them to take *you* away."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, Cucullus non facit monachum—that’s as much to say as I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool."
    m:
      - "Oh, what a big mistake! Madam, you can’t judge a book by its cover. I mean, I may look like a fool, but my mind’s sharp. Please let me prove you’re a fool."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Can you do it?"
    m:
      - "Can you do that?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Dexterously, good madonna."
    m:
      - "Easily, madam."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Make your proof."
    m:
      - "Then go ahead and prove it."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "I must catechise you for it, madonna. Good my mouse of virtue, answer me."
    m:
      - "I’ll have to ask you some questions, madam. Please answer, my good little student."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I’ll bide your proof."
    m:
      - "I’m listening to you only because I’ve got nothing better to do."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Good madonna, why mournest thou?"
    m:
      - "My dear madam, why are you in mourning?"

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Good fool, for my brother’s death."
    m:
      - "My dear fool, because my brother died."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "I think his soul is in hell, madonna."
    m:
      - "I think his soul’s in hell, my lady."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "I know his soul is in heaven, fool."
    m:
      - "I know his soul’s in heaven, fool."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother’s soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen."
    m:
      - "Then you’re a fool for being sad that your brother’s soul is in heaven. Take away this fool, gentlemen."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "What think you of this fool, Malvolio? Doth he not mend?"
    m:
      - "What do you think of this fool, Malvolio? Isn’t he getting funnier?"

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool."
    m:
      - "Yes, and he’ll keep getting funnier till he dies. Old age always makes people act funny—even wise people, but fools more than anybody."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool."
    m:
      - "I hope you go senile soon, sir, so you can become a more foolish fool! Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I’m not smart, but he wouldn’t bet two cents that you’re not a fool."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "How say you to that, Malvolio?"
    m:
      - "What do you say to that, Malvolio?"

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal."
      - "I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that"
      - "has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he’s out of his guard already. Unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools’ zanies."
    m:
      - "I’m surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker. The other day I saw him defeated in a battle of wits by an ordinary jester with no more brains than a rock. Look at him, he’s at a loss for words already. Unless he’s got somebody laughing at him, he can’t think of anything to say. I swear, anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester’s apprentice."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets. There is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail. Nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove."
    m:
      - "Malvolio, your vanity is damaging your good taste. If you were generous, innocent, and good-natured, you wouldn’t get so upset by what the fool says. You’d think of his wisecracks as harmless little firecrackers, not hurtful bullets. A court jester isn’t really criticizing people, even if he does nothing but make fun of them all day long. And a wise person doesn’t make fun of people, even if all he does is criticize them."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speakest well of fools!"
    m:
      - "You speak so highly of fools! I hope the god of deception rewards you by making you a wonderful liar."

  - os: "Enter MARIA"
    ms: "MARIA enters."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you."
    m:
      - "Madam, there’s a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "From the Count Orsino, is it?"
    m:
      - "Was he sent by Count Orsino?"

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "I know not, madam. ’Tis a fair young man, and well attended."
    m:
      - "I don’t know, madam. He’s a good-looking young man, and there are a lot of people with him."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Who of my people hold him in delay?"
    m:
      - "Who’s talking to him now?"

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman."
    m:
      - "Sir Toby, madam, you’re relative."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Fetch him off, I pray you. He speaks nothing but madman."
      - "Fie on him!"
    m:
      - "Send Toby away, please. He talks nothing but nonsense."

  - os: "Exit MARIA"
    ms: "MARIA exits."

  - o:
      - "Go you, Malvolio. If it be a suit from the count, I am sick, or not at home. What you will, to dismiss it."
    m:
      - "Go out and talk to this visitor, Malvolio. If he’s got a message from the count, tell him I’m sick, or not home. Tell him anything you want, as long as you make him go away."

  - os: "Exit MALVOLIO"
    ms: "MALVOLIO exits."

  - o:
      - "Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it."
    m:
      - "Now you see how your fooling gets boring, and people don’t like it."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a fool, whose skull Jove cram with brains, for— here he comes—one of thy kin has a most weak *pia mater.*"
    m:
      - "Madam, you’ve spoken so highly of us fools, you’d think your oldest son was going into that line of work. I hope God crams his skull full of brains, because here comes one of your relatives who’s pretty weak in the head."

  - os: "Enter SIR TOBY BELCH"
    ms: "SIR TOBY BELCH enters."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "By mine honor, half-drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?"
    m:
      - "I swear, he’s half drunk already. Who’s that at the gate, uncle?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "A gentleman."
    m:
      - "A gentleman."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "A gentleman? What gentleman?"
    m:
      - "A gentleman? What gentleman?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "’Tis a gentleman here—a plague o’ these pickle herring!"
      - "How now, sot!"
    m:
      - "There’s some gentleman out there.—*(belching)* Damn these pickled herring! They upset my stomach. How’s it going, fool?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Good Sir Toby!"
    m:
      - "Good Sir Toby!"

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?"
    m:
      - "Uncle, uncle, how are you already so brain-dead so early in the day?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Lechery! I defy lechery. There’s one at the gate."
    m:
      - "Brain-dead! Nonsense. I defy brain-death! I told you, someone’s at the gate."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Ay, marry, what is he?"
    m:
      - "Yes, but who is he?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not. Give me faith, say I. Well, it’s all one."
    m:
      - "Let him be the devil if he wants to, I don’t care. God will protect me. What do I care who it is?"

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "SIR TOBY BELCH exits."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "What’s a drunken man like, fool?"
    m:
      - "Tell me what a drunk is like, fool."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Like a drowned man, a fool and a madman. One draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him."
    m:
      - "He’s a fool, a madman, and a drowned man. The first drink makes him a fool, the second makes him crazy, and the third drowns him."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o’ my coz. For he’s in the third degree of drink, he’s drowned. Go look after him."
    m:
      - "Go find the coroner and tell him to perform an inquest on my uncle, because he’s in the third degree of drunkenness—he’s drowned. Go take care of him."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "He is but mad yet, madonna, and the fool shall look to the madman."
    m:
      - "He’s still only in the crazy phase. The fool will go take care of the madman."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "The FOOL exits."

  - os: "Enter MALVOLIO"
    ms: "MALVOLIO enters."

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you were sick. He takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep. He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? He’s fortified against any denial."
    m:
      - "Madam, that young man out there says he’s got to speak to you. I told him you were sick. He claimed he knew that, and that’s why he’s come to speak with you. I told him you were asleep. He claimed to know that already too, and said that’s the reason he’s come to speak with you. What can I say to him, lady? He’s got an answer for everything."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Tell him he shall not speak with me."
    m:
      - "Tell him he’s not going to speak with me."

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "Has been told so, and he says he’ll stand at your door like a sheriff’s post, and be the supporter to a bench, but he’ll speak with you."
    m:
      - "I told him that. He says he’ll stand at your door like a signpost or a bench until he speaks with you."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "What kind o’ man is he?"
    m:
      - "What kind of man is he?"

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "Why, of mankind."
    m:
      - "Just a man, like any other."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "What manner of man?"
    m:
      - "But what’s he like?"

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "Of very ill manner. He’ll speak with you, will you or no."
    m:
      - "He’s very rude. He insists he’ll speak with you whether you want him to or not."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Of what personage and years is he?"
    m:
      - "What does he look like? How old is he?"

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy, as a squash is before ’tis a peascod, or a codling when ’tis almost an apple. ’Tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favored, and he speaks very shrewishly. One would think his mother’s milk were scarce out of him."
    m:
      - "Not old enough to be a man, but not young enough to be a boy. He’s like a bud before it becomes a pea pod, or like a little green apple before it gets big and ripe. He’s somewhere between boy and man. He’s very handsome and speaks well, but he’s very young. He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman."
    m:
      - "Show him in. Call in my maid."

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "Gentlewoman, my lady calls."
    m:
      - "Maria, our lady wants you."

    ms: "MARIA enters."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Give me my veil. Come, throw it o’er my face. *(OLIVIA puts on a veil)* We’ll once more hear Orsino’s embassy."
    m:
      - "Give me my veil. Come, put it over my face. *(OLIVIA puts on her veil)* We’re going to hear Orsino’s pleas again."

  - os: "Enter VIOLA, with attendants"
    ms: "VIOLA enters, dressed as CESARIO, with attendants."

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "The honorable lady of the house, which is she?"
    m:
      - "Which one of you is the lady of the house?"

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Speak to me. I shall answer for her. Your will?"
    m:
      - "You can speak to me. I represent her. What do you want?"

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty—I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast away my speech, for besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn. I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage."
    m:
      - "What stunning, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty—but please, tell me if you’re the lady of the house, because I’ve never seen her. I’d hate to waste my speech on the wrong person, because It’s very well written and I spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it. Beautiful ladies, please don’t treat me badly. I’m very sensitive, and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Whence came you, sir?"
    m:
      - "Where do you come from, sir?"

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "I can say little more than I have studied, and that question’s out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech."
    m:
      - "I’m sorry, but I memorized what I’m supposed to say here today, and that question isn’t part of the speech I learned. Please, my lady, just confirm that you’re the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Are you a comedian?"
    m:
      - "Are you an actor?"

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "No, my profound heart. And yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?"
    m:
      - "No, madam. But I swear I’m not the person I’m playing. Are you the lady of the house?"

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "If I do not usurp myself, I am."
    m:
      - "I am, unless I somehow stole this role."

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message."
    m:
      - "If you’re the lady of the house, then it’s true you’re stealing your role, because what’s yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself. But that’s not part of what I’m supposed to say. I’ll go on with my speech praising you, and then I’ll get to the point."

  - sp: OLIVIA
    o:
      - "Come to what is important in ’t. I forgive you the praise."
    m:
      - "Get to the point now. I’ll let you get away with skipping the praise."

  - sp: VIOLA
    o:
      - "Alas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis poetical."
    m:
      - "That’s too bad, because I spent a long time memorizing it, and it’s poetic."

  - sp: OLIVIA

But I don’t necessarily want to listen to you. If you’re just insane, then get out of here. If you’re in your right mind, get to the point. I’ve got no patience for lunacy at the moment, and I don’t want to waste my time on ridiculous conversations."

Were you sent hither to praise me?"
