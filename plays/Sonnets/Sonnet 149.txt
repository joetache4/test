      - "Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not,"
      - "When I against myself with thee partake?"
      - "Do I not think on thee, when I forgot"
      - "Am of myself, all, tyrant, for thy sake?"
      - "Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?"
      - "On whom frown’st thou that I do fawn upon?"
      - "Nay, if thou lour’st on me, do I not spend"
      - "Revenge upon myself with present moan?"
      - "What merit do I in myself respect,"
      - "That is so proud thy service to despise,"
      - "When all my best doth worship thy defect,"
      - "Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?"
      - "  But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;"
      - "  Those that can see thou lov’st, and I am blind."

      - "Oh, you cruel woman, can you say I don’t love you when I take sides with you against myself? Don’t I think about you even when I’ve forgotten about myself—and all for your sake, you tyrant? Who hates you that I would call my friend? Who do you frown at that I grovel on and flatter? No—if you scowl at me, don’t I immediately punish myself by moaning? Which quality do I see in myself that would make me too proud to be your servant? All of the best in me worships the worst in you, and you can command me with a glance. But, my love, go on hating me, because now I know your mind. You love people who can see, and I’m blind."
