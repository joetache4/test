    o:
      - "If by your art, my dearest father, you have"
      - "Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them."
      - "The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,"
      - "But that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin’s cheek,"
      - "Dashes the fire out. Oh, I have suffered"
      - "With those that I saw suffer. A brave vessel"
      - "Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her"
      - "Dashed all to pieces. Oh, the cry did knock"
      - "Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perished."
      - "Had I been any god of power, I would"
      - "Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere"
      - "It should the good ship so have swallowed and"
      - "The fraughting souls within her."
    m:
      - "Dear father, if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers, please put an end to it. The sky’s so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea weren’t swelling up to the sky to put its fire out. Oh, I suffered along with all the men I watched suffer! A fine ship, with some good people in it, I’m sure, smashed to pieces. Their dying shouts broke my heart! The poor people died. If I’d been a god I would’ve let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    Be collected."
      - "No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart"
      - "There’s no harm done."
    m:
      - "Calm down. There’s nothing to get upset about. No harm was done."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    Oh, woe the day!"
    m:
      - "Oh, what a horrible day!"

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    No harm."
      - "I have done nothing but in care of thee,"
      - "Of thee, my dear one—thee my daughter, who"
      - "Art ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing"
      - "Of whence I am, nor that I am more better"
      - "Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell"
      - "And thy no greater father."
    m:
      - "There was no harm, I’m telling you. Everything I’ve done has been for you, my dear daughter. You don’t know what you are, since you don’t know who I am or where I come from, or that I’m better than merely Prospero, your humble father who lives in a poor little shack."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    More to know"
      - "Did never meddle with my thoughts."
    m:
      - "It never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to know."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    ’Tis time"
      - "I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand"
      - "And pluck my magic garment from me."
    m:
      - "It’s time for you to know the whole story. Give me a hand and help me off with this magic cloak."

  - os: "MIRANDA helps PROSPERO remove his mantle"
    ms: "MIRANDA helps PROSPERO remove his cloak."

  - o:
      - "    So,"
      - "Lie there, my art.—Wipe thou thine eyes. Have comfort."
      - "The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touched"
      - "The very virtue of compassion in thee,"
      - "I have with such provision in mine art"
      - "So safely ordered that there is no soul—"
      - "No, not so much perdition as an hair"
      - "Betid to any creature in the vessel—"
      - "Which thou heard’st cry, which thou sawst sink. Sit down."
      - "For thou must now know farther."
    m:
      - "*(to the cloak)* So, lie there, my magic. *(to MIRANDA)* Wipe your eyes. Take comfort. I arranged the horrible sight of this shipwreck, which moved you to such pity, so carefully that not a single person was hurt—no, not so much as a hair on anyone’s head was destroyed in the ship that you saw sink. Sit down. It’s time for you to know more. *(they sit)*"

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    You have often"
      - "Begun to tell me what I am, but stopped"
      - "And left me to a bootless inquisition,"
      - "Concluding, “Stay. Not yet.”"
    m:
      - "You’ve often started to tell me who I am, but then suddenly stopped, leaving me asking questions that never get answered, telling me, “Wait. Not yet.”"

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    The hour’s now come."
      - "The very minute bids thee ope thine ear."
      - "Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember"
      - "A time before we came unto this cell?"
      - "I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not"
      - "Out three years old."
    m:
      - "Well, the time has come. This is the moment for you to listen hard and pay close attention. Can you remember the time before you came to live in this shack? I doubt it, since you weren’t even three at the time."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    Certainly, sir, I can."
    m:
      - "Sure I can, father."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "By what? By any other house or person?"
      - "Of anything the image tell me that"
      - "Hath kept with thy remembrance."
    m:
      - "What do you remember? A house, a person? Tell me anything you remember."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    ’Tis far off,"
      - "And rather like a dream than an assurance"
      - "That my remembrance warrants. Had I not"
      - "Four or five women once that tended me?"
    m:
      - "My memory is hazy, more like a dream than a recollection. Didn’t I use to have four or five women taking care of me?"

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it"
      - "That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else"
      - "In the dark backward and abysm of time?"
      - "If thou rememberest aught ere thou camest here,"
      - "How thou camest here thou mayst."
    m:
      - "Indeed you did, and more besides, Miranda. But how is it possible that you still remember this, through all the darkness of the past? If you remember your life before you came here, you may also remember how you got here."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    But that I do not."
    m:
      - "No, that I don’t remember."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,"
      - "Thy father was the Duke of Milan and"
      - "A prince of power."
    m:
      - "Twelve years ago, Miranda, twelve years ago your father was the Duke of Milan, a powerful prince."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    Sir, are not you my father?"
    m:
      - "Aren’t you my father?"

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "Thy mother was a piece of virtue and"
      - "She said thou wast my daughter. And thy father"
      - "Was Duke of Milan, and thou his only heir"
      - "And princess no worse issued."
    m:
      - "Your mother was extremely virtuous, and she said you were my daughter. And your father was Duke of Milan, and you were his heir, a princess."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    Oh, the heavens!"
      - "What foul play had we that we came from thence?"
      - "Or blessè was ’t we did?"
    m:
      - "Good lord! What evil things were done to us that we were driven here? Or was it a blessing that we came here?"

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    Both, both, my girl."
      - "By foul play, as thou sayst, were we heaved thence,"
      - "But blessedly holp hither."
    m:
      - "Both, both, my girl. We were pushed out of power by evil deeds, as you call them. But we were blessed in being helped toward this island."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    Oh, my heart bleeds"
      - "To think o’ th’ teen that I have turned you to,"
      - "Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther."
    m:
      - "Oh, it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to recall all this, things that I can’t remember. But please tell me more."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio—"
      - "I pray thee, mark me (that a brother should"
      - "Be so perfidious!)—he whom next thyself"
      - "Of all the world I loved and to him put"
      - "The manage of my state, as at that time"
      - "Through all the signories it was the first,"
      - "And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed"
      - "In dignity, and for the liberal arts"
      - "Without a parallel. Those being all my study,"
      - "The government I cast upon my brother"
      - "And to my state grew stranger, being transported"
      - "And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—"
      - "Dost thou attend me?"
    m:
      - "My brother, your uncle Antonio—just listen to this (I still can’t believe a brother could be so disloyal!)—My brother whom—aside from you—I loved more than anyone else in the world, I trusted to run my state, which at that time was the strongest in the land, and Prospero the number one duke, famous for my dignity and my education. Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic, grammar, geometry, and astronomy, I let my control of the government slide a bit, being too wrapped up in my occult books. Your disloyal uncle—are you paying attention?"

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    Sir, most heedfully."
    m:
      - "I’m hanging on every word."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "Being once perfected how to grant suits,"
      - "How to deny them, who t’ advance and who"
      - "To trash for overtopping, new created"
      - "The creatures that were mine, I say—or changed ’em,"
      - "Or else new formed ’em—having both the key"
      - "Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ th’ state"
      - "To what tune pleased his ear, that now he was"
      - "The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,"
      - "And sucked my verdure out on ’t. Thou attend’st not."
    m:
      - "Once Antonio got the knack of granting certain requests, denying others, promoting some officials and keeping down those who were getting too ambitious, he won over the people who used to be mine, or changed them—remade them, you might say. Since he had control over the whole government and everyone in it, he soon made everyone sing his own song—whichever song he happened to like. He became like the ivy that sticks to the side of the tree, and sucked my vitality out of me.—You’re not paying attention."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "O, good sir, I do."
    m:
      - "Oh, yes I am, father."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    I pray thee, mark me."
      - "I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated"
      - "To closeness and the bettering of my mind"
      - "With that which, but by being so retired,"
      - "O’erprized all popular rate, in my false brother"
      - "Awaked an evil nature. And my trust,"
      - "Like a good parent, did beget of him"
      - "A falsehood in its contrary as great"
      - "As my trust was, which had indeed no limit,"
      - "A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,"
      - "Not only with what my revenue yielded"
      - "But what my power might else exact, like one"
      - "Who having into truth, by telling of it,"
      - "Made such a sinner of his memory"
      - "To credit his own lie—he did believe"
      - "He was indeed the duke, out o’ th’ substitution"
      - "And executing th’ outward face of royalty,"
      - "With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing—"
      - "Dost thou hear?"
    m:
      - "Please listen to me carefully. As I neglected practical matters, being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with subjects more valuable than most people imagine, I was so shut away from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my disloyal brother. My deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy, arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust was—my trust which had no limit, an infinite confidence. With Antonio possessing such powers and wealth, coming not only from my income but also from his ability to take whatever my authority allowed him to take, Antonio started to believe that he was the duke, like some liar who begins to believe in his own lie. He put on the face of royalty, with all the rights that go along with it. With his ambition growing like this—do you hear what I’m saying?"

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    Your tale, sir, would cure deafness."
    m:
      - "What you’re saying could cure deafness, father. Of course I hear it."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "To have no screen between this part he played"
      - "And him he played it for, he needs will be"
      - "Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library"
      - "Was dukedom large enough. Of temporal royalties"
      - "He thinks me now incapable, confederates—"
      - "So dry he was for sway—wi’ th’ King of Naples"
      - "To give him annual tribute, do him homage,"
      - "Subject his coronet to his crown and bend"
      - "The dukedom yet unbowed—alas, poor Milan!—"
      - "To most ignoble stooping."
    m:
      - "To make his political performance absolutely perfect, he simply had to become the Duke of Milan himself. My library was a large enough dukedom for me. So, now Antonio judges me incapable of carrying out my duties. He’s so power-hungry that he allies himself with the King of Naples, agreeing to pay him a regular annual sum, swear subservience to him, and put the dukedom of Milan—never subservient to anyone before!—under the humiliating control of Naples."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    Oh, the heavens!"
    m:
      - "Good heavens!"

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "Mark his condition and the event. Then tell me"
      - "If this might be a brother."
    m:
      - "Think about that, and about what followed afterward. Then tell me if Antonio can be called a brother."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    I should sin"
      - "To think but nobly of my grandmother."
      - "Good wombs have borne bad sons."
    m:
      - "It would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother. Good women sometimes give birth to bad sons."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    Now the condition."
      - "The King of Naples, being an enemy"
      - "To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit,"
      - "Which was that he, in lieu o’ th’ premises"
      - "Of homage and I know not how much tribute,"
      - "Should presently extirpate me and mine"
      - "Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan"
      - "With all the honors on my brother. Whereon,"
      - "A treacherous army levied, one midnight"
      - "Fated to th’ purpose did Antonio open"
      - "The gates of Milan, and, i’ th’ dead of darkness,"
      - "The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence"
      - "Me and thy crying self."
    m:
      - "Now listen to the agreement they made. The king of Naples, my arch-enemy, listens to my brother’s request, which was that the king, in exchange for the respect and money paid to him, would get rid of me and make my brother Duke of Milan instead. A treacherous army was gathered, and one fateful night at midnight, Antonio opened the gates of Milan, and in the pitch black had his officers rush out me and you, my dear daughter. You were crying."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    Alack, for pity!"
      - "I, not remembering how I cried out then,"
      - "Will cry it o’er again. It is a hint"
      - "That wrings mine eyes to ’t."
    m:
      - "How awful! I can’t remember how I cried then, but I’ll cry all over again. This story breaks my heart."

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    Hear a little further"
      - "And then I’ll bring thee to the present business"
      - "Which now ’s upon ’s, without the which this story"
      - "Were most impertinent."
    m:
      - "Just listen a little more, and I’ll bring you up to date about the present situation, which is the whole reason I’m telling you this story in the first place."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    Wherefore did they not"
      - "That hour destroy us?"
    m:
      - "Why didn’t they just kill us that night?"

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    Well demanded, wench."
      - "My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,"
      - "So dear the love my people bore me, nor set"
      - "A mark so bloody on the business, but"
      - "With colors fairer painted their foul ends."
      - "In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,"
      - "Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared"
      - "A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigged,"
      - "Nor tackle, sail, nor mast. The very rats"
      - "Instinctively had quit it. There they hoist us"
      - "To cry to th’ sea that roared to us, to sigh"
      - "To th’ winds whose pity, sighing back again,"
      - "Did us but loving wrong."
    m:
      - "Good question, my girl. My story does raise that question. The answer, my dear, is that they didn’t dare, because the people of Milan loved me too much. The had to disguise their bloody intentions. So, to make a long story short, they hurried us onto a ship and carried us a number of miles out to sea, where they prepared a rotten carcass of a boat, with no sails or masts or ropes, which even the rats had abandoned. They tossed us in the water to cry to the sea that roared back at us, to sigh into the winds that sighed right back at us in pity."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    Alack, what trouble"
      - "Was I then to you!"
    m:
      - "God, what a burden on you I must have been!"

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    Oh, a cherubim"
      - "Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile"
      - "Infusèd with a fortitude from heaven,"
      - "When I have decked the sea with drops full salt,"
      - "Under my burthen groaned; which raised in me"
      - "An undergoing stomach to bear up"
      - "Against what should ensue."
    m:
      - "No, my dear, you were a little angel who kept me going. You smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven, while I cried salty tears into the salty sea, and groaned at our situation. Your smile sustained my spirits against whatever would come our way."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "How came we ashore?"
    m:
      - "How did we manage to get ashore?"

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    By providence divine."
      - "Some food we had and some fresh water that"
      - "A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,"
      - "Out of his charity, who being then appointed"
      - "Master of this design, did give us, with"
      - "Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,"
      - "Which since have steaded much. So, of his gentleness,"
      - "Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me"
      - "From mine own library with volumes that"
      - "I prize above my dukedom."
    m:
      - "With God’s help. We had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from Naples, Gonzalo, had given us out of the kindness of his heart. He had been chosen to carry out the plan of putting us to sea. He also gave us clothes, linen, and other necessities that have been of great help. Knowing how much I loved my books, he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "    Would I might"
      - "But ever see that man!"
    m:
      - "I wish I could see that man someday!"

  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "    Now I arise."
      - "*(stands and puts on his mantle)*"
      - "Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow."
      - "Here in this island we arrived, and here"
      - "Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit"
      - "Than other princesses can that have more time"
      - "For vainer hours and tutors not so careful."
    m:
      - "Now I’ll stand up. *(he stands and puts on his magic cloak)* Sit still and listen to the last of our sad sea adventures. We arrived here on this island, where I, acting as your teacher, have given you a better education than most princesses get, princesses who have less careful tutors, who spend their time instead on empty fun."

  - sp: MIRANDA
    o:
      - "Heavens thank you for ’t! And now, I pray you, sir—"
      - "For still ’tis beating in my mind—your reason"
      - "For raising this sea storm?"
    m:
      - "May God thank you for it. But please, father—the question is still nagging at me—why did you conjure up this storm?"

  - sp: PROSPERO

      - "(Now my dear lady) hath mine enemies"
      - "Brought to this shore. And by my prescience"
      - "I find my zenith doth depend upon"
      - "A most auspicious star, whose influence"
      - "If now I court not but omit, my fortunes"
      - "Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions."
      - "Thou art inclined to sleep. ’Tis a good dullness,"
      - "And give it way. I know thou canst not choose."
    m:
      - "You should know this: much luck is on my side, and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island. As I see it, my fate hangs on this lucky event, and if I handle it wrong, I’ll suffer for the rest of my life. Now, no more questions. You look sleepy. It’s a nice hazy feeling, so give in to it. I know you have no choice."
