  - os: "Flourish cornets Enter the Prince of MOROCCO, a tawny Moor all in white, and three or four followers accordingly, with PORTIA, NERISSA, and their train"
    ms: "Trumpets play. The prince of MOROCCO , a brown-skinned man dressed in all white, enters, followed by three or four servants dressed in costumes like his. PORTIA, NERISSA, and their ATTENDANTS enter."

  - sp: MOROCCO
    o:
      - "Mislike me not for my complexion,"
      - "The shadowed livery of the burnished sun,"
      - "To whom I am a neighbor and near bred."
      - "Bring me the fairest creature northward born,"
      - "Where Phoebus’ fire scarce thaws the icicles,"
      - "And let us make incision for your love"
      - "To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine."
      - "I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine"
      - "Hath feared the valiant. By my love I swear"
      - "The best-regarded virgins of our clime"
      - "Have loved it too. I would not change this hue"
      - "Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen."
    m:
      - "Don’t hold my skin color against me. I was born and raised in the sun, which is why I’m dark-skinned. But I’m as red-blooded as any man. Show me the best-looking person born in the freezing north, where the sun barely thaws the icicles. I’ll win your love by cutting myself to prove to you I have redder blood than he does. I’m telling you, madam, my skin color has made brave men fear me and Moroccan girls love me. I wouldn’t change it except to make you think of me, my darling queen."

  - sp: PORTIA
    o:
      - "In terms of choice I am not solely led"
      - "By nice direction of a maiden’s eyes."
      - "Besides, the lottery of my destiny"
      - "Bars me the right of voluntary choosing."
      - "But if my father had not scanted me"
      - "And hedged me by his wit to yield myself"
      - "His wife who wins me by that means I told you,"
      - "Yourself, renownèd Prince, then stood as fair"
      - "As any comer I have looked on yet"
      - "For my affection."
    m:
      - "Being good-looking isn’t the only way to my heart, you know. I have other criteria for choosing a husband. Not that it matters, because the box test takes away my free choice anyway. But if my father hadn’t restricted me like this—forcing me to marry whoever wins his test—then you’d have had as good a chance to marry me as any of the suitors I’ve met so far, prince."

  - sp: MOROCCO
    o:
      - "  Even for that I thank you."
      - "Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets"
      - "To try my fortune. By this scimitar"
      - "That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince"
      - "That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,"
      - "I would o’erstare the sternest eyes that look,"
      - "Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,"
      - "Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,"
      - "Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,"
      - "To win the lady. But, alas the while!"
      - "If Hercules and Lychas play at dice"
      - "Which is the better man, the greater throw"
      - "May turn by fortune from the weaker hand."
      - "So is Alcides beaten by his page,"
      - "And so may I, blind fortune leading me,"
      - "Miss that which one unworthier may attain"
      - "And die with grieving."
    m:
      - "Thank you for saying that. Show me the caskets and let me try my luck. I swear by my sword, which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times, that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth. I would act braver than the bravest man on earth. I would grab bear cubs from a ferocious mother bear, or tease a hungry lion—all of this in order to win your love, lady. But this is bad! If the hero Hercules and his servant Lychas rolled the dice, which would win? Not the greater hero. Just the one who happened to be luckier that time. And just as Hercules could be beaten by his servant, blind luck could make me lose this test and make someone worse than me win. If that happened, I’d die of sadness."

  - sp: PORTIA
    o:
      - "    You must take your chance,"
      - "And either not attempt to choose at all"
      - "Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong"
      - "Never to speak to lady afterward"
      - "In way of marriage. Therefore be advised."
    m:
      - "You have to take your chances. Either don’t choose at all, or swear beforehand that if you choose incorrectly you’ll never talk about marriage to any woman again. Think about it carefully."

  - sp: MOROCCO
    o:
      - "Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance."
    m:
      - "Fine, I swear I won’t ever get married if I choose incorrectly. Let me take my chances."

  - sp: PORTIA
    o:
      - "First, forward to the temple. After dinner"
      - "Your hazard shall be made."
    m:
      - "Let’s go to the temple first. You can take your chances after dinner."

  - sp: MOROCCO
    o:
      - "    Good fortune then!—"
      - "To make me blessed or cursed’st among men."
    m:
      - "I’ll try my luck then. I’ll either be the luckiest or the unluckiest man alive."

  - os: "Cornets"
    ms: "Trumpets play."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
