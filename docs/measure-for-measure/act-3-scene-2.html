<p>Why? For plugging a hole. I wish the duke were back again. His sexless deputy’s abstinence policy will depopulate the province. Even sparrows can’t nest on his roof, because they’re lecherous! The duke would have punished sexual acts privately—he’d never publicly expose them. I wish he were back! Claudio is condemned for getting undressed. Goodbye, good friar. Please pray for me. I tell you again, the duke was no choir boy—he would eat mutton on Fridays. He’s not past it yet, and I tell you, he’d French-kiss a beggar, even if she smelled of moldy bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Goodbye.</p>
