  - os: "Enter KING Henry in his nightgown, with a page"
    ms: "KING Henry enters, wearing his nightgown. A page follows."

  - sp: KING
    o:
      - "Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;"
      - "But, ere they come, bid them o’erread these letters"
      - "And well consider of them. Make good speed."
    m:
      - "Call the earls of Surrey and Warwick. Tell them to read over these letters before they come, and to think carefully about them. Hurry."

  - os: "Exit page"
    ms: "The page exits."

  - o:
      - "How many thousand of my poorest subjects"
      - "Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,"
      - "Nature’s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,"
      - "That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down"
      - "And steep my senses in forgetfulness?"
      - "Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,"
      - "Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee"
      - "And hushed with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,"
      - "Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,"
      - "Under the canopies of costly state,"
      - "And lull’d with sound of sweetest melody?"
      - "O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile"
      - "In loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch"
      - "A watch-case or a common ’larum bell?"
      - "Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast"
      - "Seal up the shipboy’s eyes, and rock his brains"
      - "In cradle of the rude imperious surge"
      - "And in the visitation of the winds,"
      - "Who take the ruffian billows by the top,"
      - "Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them"
      - "With deafening clamor in the slippery clouds"
      - "That with the hurly death itself awakes?"
      - "Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose"
      - "To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,"
      - "And, in the calmest and most stillest night,"
      - "With all appliances and means to boot,"
      - "Deny it to a king? Then, happy low, lie down."
      - "Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown."
    m:
      - "Thousands of even my poorest subjects are sleeping right now. Oh sleep! Oh sweet sleep, nature’s gentle healer, what have I done to frighten you? You won’t weigh down my eyelids anymore, or dull my mind to make me forget. Sleep, why do you lie in filthy hovels, stretched out on uncomfortable cots, where insects’ buzzing is the lullaby? Why don’t you lie in the sweet-smelling bedrooms of kings, under opulent canopies, lulled with soft and beautiful music? You drowsy god, why do you lie with the common people in their loathsome beds, leaving the royal bed lonely like a sentry post, or a bell tower? Will you even close the eyes of a ship boy, high up on the whirling mast, and rock him gently in a cradle made of rough, tossing seas and howling winds—winds which take the waves and, curling them over, crashes them through the air with such a deafening noise that they wake death itself? Can you, oh unfair sleep, give rest to a drenched little sailor in the midst of such roughness, and yet deny it to a king? A king on the calmest, stillest night, with everything available for sleep? Then, you happy commoners, put yourselves to bed. The head that wears the crown sleeps uneasily."

  - os: "Enter WARWICK and SURREY"
    ms: "WARWICK and SURREY enter."

  - sp: WARWICK
    o:
      - "Many good morrows to your Majesty."
    m:
      - "Good morning, your highness."

  - sp: KING
    o:
      - "Is it good morrow, lords?"
    m:
      - "Is it morning, lords?"

  - sp: WARWICK
    o:
      - "’Tis one o’clock, and past."
    m:
      - "It’s after one o’clock."

  - sp: KING
    o:
      - "Why then, good morrow to you all, my lords."
      - "Have you read o’er the letter that I sent you?"
    m:
      - "Well, then, good morning to you all, my lords. Have you read the letters I sent you?"

  - sp: WARWICK
    o:
      - "We have, my liege."
    m:
      - "We have, your highness."

  - sp: KING
    o:
      - "Then you perceive the body of our kingdom"
      - "How foul it is, what rank diseases grow"
      - "And with what danger near the heart of it."
    m:
      - "Then you can tell how sick the kingdom is. There are serious diseases spreading through its body, very near its heart."

  - sp: WARWICK
    o:
      - "It is but as a body yet distempered,"
      - "Which to his former strength may be restored"
      - "With good advice and little medicine."
      - "My Lord Northumberland will soon be cooled."
    m:
      - "The body’s only out of sorts. It can be brought back to full health through good care and some medicine. Northumberland will soon be suppressed."

  - sp: KING
    o:
      - "O God, that one might read the book of fate"
      - "And see the revolution of the times"
      - "Make mountains level, and the continent,"
      - "Weary of solid firmness, melt itself"
      - "Into the sea, and other times to see"
      - "The beachy girdle of the ocean"
      - "Too wide for Neptune’s hips; how chance’s mocks"
      - "And changes fill the cup of alteration"
      - "With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,"
      - "The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,"
      - "What perils past, what crosses to ensue,"
      - "Would shut the book, and sit him down and die."
      - "’Tis not ten years gone"
      - "Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,"
      - "Did feast together, and in two years after"
      - "Were they at wars. It is but eight years since"
      - "This Percy was the man nearest my soul,"
      - "Who like a brother toiled in my affairs"
      - "And laid his love and life under my foot,"
      - "Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard"
      - "Gave him defiance. But which of you was by—"
      - "*(to WARWICK)* You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember—"
      - "When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,"
      - "Then checked and rated by Northumberland,"
      - "Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?"
      - "“Northumberland, thou ladder by the which"
      - "My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne”—"
      - "Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,"
      - "But that necessity so bowed the state"
      - "That I and greatness were compelled to kiss—"
      - "“The time shall come,” thus did he follow it,"
      - "“The time will come that foul sin, gathering head,"
      - "Shall break into corruption”—so went on,"
      - "Foretelling this same time’s condition"
      - "And the division of our amity."
    m:
      - "Oh God! If only we could read the book of destiny! We’d see how time changes everything, bringing mountains low and melting the land—which is tired of being solid and firm—into the sea. We’d see how the beach is sometimes too wide for even the tide to conquer. We’d see how blind luck can make mockeries of men, and how change can affect you in countless ways. If even the happiest youth could read this book, he’d look at the course of his life—the dangers he’s endured, the challenges that still lie ahead—and he’d shut that book, sit down and die. It was less than ten years ago that Richard and Northumberland loved each other. Then two years later, they were at war. Just eight years ago, Northumberland was the man closest to my heart. Like a brother, he devoted himself to me, dedicating both life and limb to my cause. He even challenged Richard on my behalf. But which of you was there— I think it was you, Warwick—when Richard, his eyes brimming with tears because of Northumberland’s rebellion, spoke these words that now seem prophetic: “Northumberland, you are the ladder that Bolingbroke has climbed to get to the throne.” Although, God knows, it wasn’t my intention then to become king. But the country needed it so badly, I was forced to rise up and become great. “The time will come,” Richard continued, “when this terrible sin, growing in size, will break out into corruption.” That’s how he went on. He predicted our current condition, and the collapse of our alliances."

  - sp: WARWICK
    o:
      - "There is a history in all men’s lives"
      - "Figuring the nature of the times deceased,"
      - "The which observed, a man may prophesy,"
      - "With a near aim, of the main chance of things"
      - "As yet not come to life, which in their seeds"
      - "And weak beginnings lie intreasurèd."
      - "Such things become the hatch and brood of time,"
      - "And by the necessary form of this,"
      - "King Richard might create a perfect guess"
      - "That great Northumberland, then false to him,"
      - "Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness,"
      - "Which should not find a ground to root upon"
      - "Unless on you."
    m:
      - "There is a chronicle for every man’s life, which shows what happened to him in times now past. If you study that chronicle, you can prophecy what lies ahead with some accuracy. The seeds of things to come are buried in the things that have already happened. These seeds grow, and become the children of time. King Richard could look at the pattern of what had gone before and predict perfectly that Northumberland’s betrayal—then still a seed—would someday grow larger, if it could find suitable soil to root in. And you’re the only soil it could have found."

  - sp: KING
    o:
      - "Are these things then necessities?"
      - "Then let us meet them like necessities."
      - "And that same word even now cries out on us."
      - "They say the Bishop and Northumberland"
      - "Are fifty thousand strong."
    m:
      - "Were these things necessary, then? Then we’ll treat them like necessities, even though the very word “necessities” cries out against us. They say the Archbishop and Northumberland have fifty thousand men in their army."

  - sp: WARWICK
    o:
      - "It cannot be, my lord."
      - "Rumor doth double, like the voice and echo,"
      - "The numbers of the feared. Please it your Grace"
      - "To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,"
      - "The powers that you already have sent forth"
      - "Shall bring this prize in very easily."
      - "To comfort you the more, I have received"
      - "A certain instance that Glendower is dead."
      - "Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill,"
      - "And these unseasoned hours perforce must add"
      - "Unto your sickness."
    m:
      - "That can’t be, my lord. Rumor, like an echo, doubles the size of our enemy’s army. Please, your highness, go to bed. I swear on my soul that the army you’ve already sent out can win this battle easily. And here’s more good news: I’ve heard for sure that Glendower is dead. You’ve been ill for two weeks now, your majesty. Keeping such irregular hours will surely make things worse."

  - sp: KING
    o:
      - "  I will take your counsel."
      - "And were these inward wars once out of hand,"
      - "We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land."
    m:
      - "I’ll listen to your advice. And once we’ve got this civil war in hand, we will, my friends, march to the Holy Land."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
