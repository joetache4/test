<b>HAMLET</b>
<p>Ay, marry, is ’t.</p>
<p>But to my mind, though I am native here</p>
<p>And to the manner born, it is a custom</p>
<p>More honored in the breach than the observance.</p>
<p>This heavy-headed revel east and west</p>
<p>Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations.</p>
<p>They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase</p>
<p>Soil our addition. And indeed it takes</p>
<p>From our achievements, though performed at height,</p>
<p>The pith and marrow of our attribute.</p>
<p>So oft it chances in particular men</p>
<p>That for some vicious mole of nature in them—</p>
<p>As in their birth (wherein they are not guilty,</p>
<p>Since nature cannot choose his origin),</p>
<p>By the o’ergrowth of some complexion,</p>
<p>Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,</p>
<p>Or by some habit that too much o’erleavens</p>
<p>The form of plausive manners—that these men,</p>
<p>Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,</p>
<p>Being nature’s livery or fortune’s star,</p>
<p>Their virtues else (be they as pure as grace,</p>
<p>As infinite as man may undergo)</p>
<p>Shall in the general censure take corruption</p>
<p>From that particular fault. The dram of evil</p>
<p>Doth all the noble substance of a doubt</p>
<p>To his own scandal.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>HAMLET</b>
<p>Yes, it is. But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage, I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it. Other countries criticize us for our loud partying. They call us drunks and insult our noble titles. And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements, as great as they are, and lessens our reputations. It’s just like what happens to certain people who have some birth defect (which they are not responsible for, since nobody chooses how he’s born), or some weird habit or compulsion that changes them completely. It happens sometimes that one little defect in these people, as wonderful and talented as they may be, will make them look completely bad to other people. A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations.</p>

<p>Oh angels, protect us! Whether you’re a good spirit or a cursed demon, whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire, whether your intentions are good or evil, you look so strange I want to talk to you. I’ll call you “Hamlet Senior,” “King,” “Father,” “royal Dane.” Answer me! Don’t drive me crazy with curiosity, but tell me why your church-buried bones have burst out of their coffin, and why your tomb, where we quietly buried you, has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again. What could it mean that you have put on your armor again, you corpse, and have come back to look at the moon, making the night terrifying and stirring us humans with supernatural fears? Why? What do you want from us? What should we do?</p>
