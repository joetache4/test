<p>I agree with your honor that he’s a good-for-nothing, but God forbid that a good-for-nothing should be denied a favor when his friend asks for one on his behalf.

If I can’t get you to rule in favor of a good- for-nothing once in a while, then obviously you don’t think very much of me. That good-for-nothing is my good friend, sir.

<p>If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four dozen of</p>
<p>such bearded hermits’ staves as Master Shallow. It is a</p>
<p>wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men’s</p>
<p>spirits and his. They, by observing of him, do bear</p>
<p>themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing with</p>
<p>them, is turned into a justice-like servingman. Their spirits</p>
<p>are so married in conjunction with the participation of</p>
<p>society that they flock together in consent like so many wild</p>
<p>geese. If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humor his</p>
<p>men with the imputation of being near their master;if to his</p>
<p>men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could</p>
<p>better command his servants. It is certain that either wise</p>
<p>bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases,</p>
<p>one of another. Therefore let men take heed of their</p>
<p>company. I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to</p>
<p>keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two actions, and a’ shall laugh without intervallums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders. O, you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<p>If I were cut into pieces, I’d make four dozen bearded broomsticks like this Master Shallow. It’s amazing to see the similarity between his men’s dispositions and his own. They watch him and behave like foolish judges, and he, by associating with them, turns into a judge-like workman. Their spirits are so closely joined by their intimate involvement, they’re like a flock of wild geese that fly in formation. If I needed a favor from Judge Shallow, I would make his men think that I’m a close friend of his. If I needed something from his men, I would flatter Shallow by telling him that no one commands servants better than he does. One thing’s for sure: the behavior of a wise man and that of an idiot are contagious, like diseases. They spread from person to person, which is why people must be careful about the company they keep. I’ll come up with enough material about this Shallow to keep Prince Hal laughing nonstop for a year. That’s how much time it takes for the current fashion to change six times, or for two lawsuits to be completed. He’ll laugh with no intermission. Oh, a lie told with a measure of truth—or a joke told with a serious face—will go far with a young fellow, who has never had his shoulders weighed down by old age or worries. Oh, he’ll laugh until his face looks like a wet coat that was hung poorly—it’ll be all wrinkled from laughter.</p>
