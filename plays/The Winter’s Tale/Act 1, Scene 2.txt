  - os: "A room of state in the same."
    ms: "A formal receiving room in Leontes’ palace."

  - os: "Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants"
    ms: "LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and several attendants enter."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "Nine changes of the watery star hath been"
      - "The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne"
      - "Without a burthen: time as long again"
      - "Would be filled up, my brother, with our thanks;"
      - "And yet we should, for perpetuity,"
      - "Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,"
      - "Yet standing in rich place, I multiply"
      - "With one “We thank you” many thousands more"
      - "That go before it."
    m:
      - "It has been nine months since I left my throne. I could happily spend another nine months away, but I must leave now, forever in your debt. So, like a zero, which means “nothing” but adds value when placed beside a number, my one “thank you” will multiply the thousand more I’ve already said."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "Stay your thanks a while;"
      - "And pay them when you part."
    m:
      - "Don’t thank me yet. Wait until you leave."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "Sir, that’s to-morrow."
      - "I am question’d by my fears, of what may chance"
      - "Or breed upon our absence; that may blow"
      - "No sneaping winds at home, to make us say"
      - "“This is put forth too truly:” besides, I have stay’d"
      - "To tire your royalty."
    m:
      - "Sir, I leave tomorrow. I’m fearful of what might happen by chance, or what plot may develop, because of my absence, and I worry my fears will be confirmed. Besides, I’ve worn you out with my company."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "We are tougher, brother,"
      - "Than you can put us to’t."
    m:
      - "You couldn’t wear me out if you tried."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "No longer stay."
    m:
      - "I can’t stay any longer."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "One seven-night longer."
    m:
      - "Just one more week."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "Very sooth, to-morrow."
    m:
      - "Really, tomorrow."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "We’ll part the time between’s then; and in that"
      - "I’ll no gainsaying."
    m:
      - "We’ll split the difference, and I won’t hear any objections."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "Press me not, beseech you, so."
      - "There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ the world,"
      - "So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,"
      - "Were there necessity in your request, although"
      - "’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs"
      - "Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder"
      - "Were in your love a whip to me; my stay"
      - "To you a charge and trouble: to save both,"
      - "Farewell, our brother."
    m:
      - "Please, don’t plead with me. There is no one who can persuade me like you can, and you could persuade me to stay now if you really needed me to, even if it were necessary that I deny your request. My business does drag me home, so your attempts to keep me here, though done out of love, are painful to me. My staying only costs you and causes you trouble, so for both our sakes, I must go."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "Tongue-tied, our queen?"
      - "speak you."
    m:
      - "My queen, are you mute? Speak."

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until"
      - "You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,"
      - "Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure"
      - "All in Bohemia’s well; this satisfaction"
      - "The by-gone day proclaim’d: say this to him,"
      - "He’s beat from his best ward."
    m:
      - "I intended to keep quiet until you’d made him promise to stay. You argue too mildly. Tell him you are sure that things in Bohemia are fine—in fact, just the other day it was proclaimed so. Tell him this, and his best argument for leaving is gone."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "Well said, Hermione."
    m:
      - "Well said, Hermione."

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:"
      - "But let him say so then, and let him go;"
      - "But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,"
      - "We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs."
      - "Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure"
      - "The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia"
      - "You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission"
      - "To let him there a month behind the gest"
      - "Prefix’d for’s parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,"
      - "I love thee not a jar o’ the clock behind"
      - "What lady-she her lord. You’ll stay?"
    m:
      - "If he says that he wants to see his son, that’s a strong argument. But let him say it first, then let him go. If he swears to that, he won’t stay. We’ll chase him off by whacking him with wooden staffs. But I’m guessing he will remain in your presence another week. *(to Polixenes)* When you receive my lord in Bohemia, I’ll give him permission to stay a month past his fixed departure day *. *(to Leontes)* Yet, Leontes, I don’t love you a jot less than any other woman loves her lord. Polixenes, you’ll stay?"

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "No, madam."
    m:
      - "No, madam."

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "Nay, but you will?"
    m:
      - "No, but you will?"

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "I may not, verily."
    m:
      - "I can’t, honestly."

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "Verily!"
      - "You put me off with limber vows; but I,"
      - "Though you would seek to unsphere the"
      - "stars with oaths,"
      - "Should yet say “Sir, no going.” Verily,"
      - "You shall not go: a lady’s “Verily”’s"
      - "As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?"
      - "Force me to keep you as a prisoner,"
      - "Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees"
      - "When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?"
      - "My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread “Verily,”"
      - "One of them you shall be."
    m:
      - "Honestly! You counter me with weak vows, but even if you would try to take the stars out of the sky with your oaths, I’ll still say you are not going. Truly, you won’t go—my “truly” is as powerful as yours. Will you still go? You’ll force me to keep you like a prisoner, not like a guest, and you’ll have to pay a fine at the end, rather than give us thanks. What do you think? My prisoner, or my guest? “Truly,” as you say, you’ll be one of the two."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "Your guest, then, madam:"
      - "To be your prisoner should import offending;"
      - "Which is for me less easy to commit"
      - "Than you to punish."
    m:
      - "Your guest then, madam. Being your prisoner would suggest I’ve offended you, which would be more difficult and painful for me than your punishment."

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "Not your gaoler, then,"
      - "But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you"
      - "Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys:"
      - "You were pretty lordings then?"
    m:
      - "I won’t be your jailer, then, but your kind hostess. Come, I’ll ask you about the tricks you and my husband played when you were boys. You were handsome princes then?"

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "We were, fair queen,"
      - "Two lads that thought there was no more behind"
      - "But such a day to-morrow as to-day,"
      - "And to be boy eternal."
    m:
      - "We were, fair queen, two young boys who thought that tomorrow would be just like today, and that we would be boys forever."

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "Was not my lord"
      - "The verier wag o’ the two?"
    m:
      - "Was my husband the bigger prankster of you two?"

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "We were as twinn’d lambs that did frisk i’ the sun,"
      - "And bleat the one at the other: what we changed"
      - "Was innocence for innocence; we knew not"
      - "The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream’d"
      - "That any did. Had we pursued that life,"
      - "And our weak spirits ne’er been higher rear’d"
      - "With stronger blood, we should have answer’d heaven"
      - "Boldly “not guilty;” the imposition clear’d"
      - "Hereditary ours."
    m:
      - "We were like two lambs that played in the sun and bleated at one another. We were wholly innocent. We didn’t know what it was to do harm, or even that anyone did. Had we continued this way, and had our weak spirits never given way to stronger passions, we could have said upon reaching Heaven that we were “not guilty,” and we would have been cleared even of original sin."

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "By this we gather"
      - "You have tripp’d since."
    m:
      - "I take it that you have not been so innocent since?"

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "O my most sacred lady!"
      - "Temptations have since then been born to’s; for"
      - "In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;"
      - "Your precious self had then not cross’d the eyes"
      - "Of my young play-fellow."
    m:
      - "Most sacred lady! We’ve had our temptations since then. In those youthful days my wife was just a girl, and my playfellow had not yet seen you."

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "Grace to boot!"
      - "Of this make no conclusion, lest you say"
      - "Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;"
      - "The offences we have made you do we’ll answer,"
      - "If you first sinn’d with us and that with us"
      - "You did continue fault and that you slipp’d not"
      - "With any but with us."
    m:
      - "Heaven help me! Don’t pursue that train of thought, or you’ll go on to say that your wife and I are devils. Still, keep going. We’ll take responsibility for whatever sins we’ve made you commit, as long as those sins were committed first with us, only with us, and you’ve never sinned with any other."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "Is he won yet?"
    m:
      - "Is he won over yet?"

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "He’ll stay my lord."
    m:
      - "He’ll stay, my lord."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "At my request he would not."
      - "Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest"
      - "To better purpose."
    m:
      - "When I requested it he would not. Hermione, my dearest, you’ve never spoken so well."

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "Never?"
    m:
      - "Never?"

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "Never, but once."
    m:
      - "Only once before."

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "What! have I twice said well? when was’t before?"
      - "I prithee tell me; cram’s with praise, and make’s"
      - "As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless"
      - "Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that."
      - "Our praises are our wages: you may ride’s"
      - "With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere"
      - "With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:"
      - "My last good deed was to entreat his stay:"
      - "What was my first? it has an elder sister,"
      - "Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!"
      - "But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?"
      - "Nay, let me have’t; I long."
    m:
      - "What! I’ve only spoken well twice? When was the last time? Please, tell me. Fill me up with praise and make me as fat as a pet. If one good deed goes unrecognized, the thousand more that might have been inspired by it will never occur. Praise is our motivation and reward. One soft kiss will take you two hundred yards; a sharp kick only gets you an acre. But back to the point: my last good deed was to plead for Polixenes to stay. What was my first good deed? Unless I’m misunderstanding what you said, there was an earlier one. Oh, if only my name were Grace! So once before I’ve spoken well. When? Tell me, please, I long to know."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "Why, that was when"
      - "Three crabbed months had sour’d themselves to death,"
      - "Ere I could make thee open thy white hand"
      - "And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter"
      - "“I am yours for ever.”"
    m:
      - "Why, it was when three bitter months had passed before I could get you to pledge your love to me with your white hands. And then you said, “I am yours forever.”"

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "’Tis grace indeed."
      - "Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:"
      - "The one for ever earn’d a royal husband;"
      - "The other for some while a friend."
    m:
      - "It is grace, indeed. According to you, I have spoken well twice: once to earn a royal husband and again to keep a friend a while longer."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "*(aside)* Too hot, too hot!"
      - "To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods."
      - "I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;"
      - "But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment"
      - "May a free face put on, derive a liberty"
      - "From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,"
      - "And well become the agent; ’t may, I grant;"
      - "But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,"
      - "As now they are, and making practised smiles,"
      - "As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as ’twere"
      - "The mort o’ the deer; O, that is entertainment"
      - "My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,"
      - "Art thou my boy?"
    m:
      - "*(aside)* That is too much! To take friendship too far is to make it a love affair. My heart is trembling and dancing, but not for joy. This hospitality may have an innocent face, and my wife’s generosity may in fact come from warmth, affection, and the fact that it makes her more attractive. Maybe. But to hold hands, as they are doing right now, and flirtatiously smile at each other as though into a mirror, all the while sighing as loud as a horn blast, that is not entertainment that pleases my heart, or my head. Mamillius, are you my son?"

  - sp: MAMILLIUS
    o:
      - "Ay, my good lord."
    m:
      - "Yes, my good lord."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "I’ fecks!"
      - "Why, that’s my bawcock. What, hast"
      - "smutch’d thy nose?"
      - "They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,"
      - "We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:"
      - "And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf"
      - "Are all call’d neat.—Still virginalling"
      - "Upon his palm!—How now, you wanton calf!"
      - "Art thou my calf?"
    m:
      - "In faith! That’s my fine fellow. What, have you smudged your nose? They say it looks just like mine. Come on, captain, you must be neat, that is, clean. Yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf are all called neat. Still playing her fingers up and down his palm! What are you up to, you silly calf? Are you my calf?"

  - sp: MAMILLIUS
    o:
      - "Yes, if you will, my lord."
    m:
      - "Yes, if you’d like me to be, my lord."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "Thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,"
      - "To be full like me: yet they say we are"
      - "Almost as like as eggs; women say so,"
      - "That will say anything but were they false"
      - "As o’er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false"
      - "As dice are to be wish’d by one that fixes"
      - "No bourn ’twixt his and mine, yet were it true"
      - "To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,"
      - "Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!"
      - "Most dear’st! my collop! Can thy dam?—may’t be?—"
      - "Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:"
      - "Thou dost make possible things not so held,"
      - "Communicatest with dreams;—how can this be?—"
      - "With what’s unreal thou coactive art,"
      - "And fellow’st nothing: then ’tis very credent"
      - "Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,"
      - "And that beyond commission, and I find it,"
      - "And that to the infection of my brains"
      - "And hardening of my brows."
    m:
      - "You need a shaggy head and horns to be just like me. Still, they say we are as alike as a pair of eggs. Women say that, and they will say anything. But even if they were as false as Africans or black fabric, or as fickle as the wind and the water, or fixed as a cheating gambler wants the dice to be, it would still be true that this boy looks like me. Come, sir page, look at me with your sky blue eye. Sweet villain! Dearest! My flesh! Can your mother have? Could it be? Jealousy’s intensity strikes me through to my heart and makes things that are impossible seem possible. That jealousy speaks in dreams. How can this be? It collaborates with what’s unreal and corresponds to nothing in real life. Then it’s very believable that my jealousy may be real, and she’s gone beyond what’s permitted, and I would find out and grow insane, and my brow would harden into horns."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "What means Sicilia?"
    m:
      - "What is Leontes saying?"

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "He something seems unsettled."
    m:
      - "He seems upset."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "How, my lord?"
    m:
      - "How are you, my lord?"

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "What cheer? how is’t with you, best brother?"
    m:
      - "What news? How are you, my best brother?"

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "You look as if you held a brow of much distraction"
      - "Are you moved, my lord?"
    m:
      - "You look distracted. Are you upset, my lord?"

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "No, in good earnest."
      - "How sometimes nature will betray its folly,"
      - "Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime"
      - "To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines"
      - "Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil"
      - "Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech’d,"
      - "In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,"
      - "Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,"
      - "As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:"
      - "How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,"
      - "This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,"
      - "Will you take eggs for money?"
    m:
      - "No, truly. Sometimes nature shows its weakness, its tenderness, and makes itself a source of amusement for harder hearts. Looking at my boy’s face, I thought I had gone back twenty-three years and saw myself without trousers, in my green velvet coat, with my dagger carefully sheathed so I would not hurt myself on it and so it wouldn’t prove too dangerous, as toys often do. I thought how alike I was at that age to this child, this young boy, this gentleman. My honest friend, will you accept something relatively worthless in exchange for something valuable?"

  - sp: MAMILLIUS
    o:
      - "No, my lord, I’ll fight."
    m:
      - "No, my lord, I’ll fight."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "You will! why, happy man be’s dole! My brother,"
      - "Are you so fond of your young prince as we"
      - "Do seem to be of ours?"
    m:
      - "You will! May happiness be his fortune! My brother, are you as fond of your young prince as I seem to be of mine?"

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "If at home, sir,"
      - "He’s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,"
      - "Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,"
      - "My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:"
      - "He makes a July’s day short as December,"
      - "And with his varying childness cures in me"
      - "Thoughts that would thick my blood."
    m:
      - "When I’m home, sir, he’s my occupation, my laughter, all I worry about. First he’s my sworn friend, then he’s an enemy, a freeloader, a soldier, and a statesman, all together. He makes a long summer’s day feel as short as a day in the middle of winter. And his childish ways keep me from gloomy thoughts."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "So stands this squire"
      - "Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,"
      - "And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,"
      - "How thou lovest us, show in our brother’s welcome;"
      - "Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:"
      - "Next to thyself and my young rover, he’s"
      - "Apparent to my heart."
    m:
      - "This young squire here does the same for me. He and I will walk along, my lord, and leave you to your slower steps. Hermione, show how much you love us in how you entertain our brother. Give him whatever he wants, no matter how expensive. After you and my young son, he’s dearest to me."

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "If you would seek us,"
      - "We are yours i’ the garden: shall’s attend you there?"
    m:
      - "If you are looking for us, we’ll be in the garden. Should we wait for you there?"

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "To your own bents dispose you: you’ll be found,"
      - "Be you beneath the sky."
      - "*(aside)*"
      - "I am angling now,"
      - "Though you perceive me not how I give line."
      - "Go to, go to!"
      - "How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!"
      - "And arms her with the boldness of a wife"
      - "To her allowing husband!"
    m:
      - "Do whatever pleases you. I’ll find you, if you are anywhere under the sky. *(aside)* I’m fishing now, though no one sees how I set the line. Go on! Look how she holds up her nose and mouth to him, as if to be kissed. She acts with the boldness of a wife toward her husband!"

  - os: "Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants"
    ms: "POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and attendants exit."

Your mother plays around, and I play a role, though my part is one of a disgrace, with the result that I’ll be hissed on my way to the grave, with contempt as my funeral bells. Go play, boy, play. Unless I’m mistaken, there have been cuckolds before. Even now, as I speak, there is many a man who may hold his wife by the arm without suspecting that she has been unfaithful in his absence, and his neighbor, call him Sir Smile, has been with the woman that belongs to him. There’s comfort in the fact that other men have had wives and those wives have been unfaithful, as mine has, against their will. If everyone whose wife strayed were to despair, a tenth of mankind would hang themselves. There’s no remedy for it, since it is a world full of lust, from east to west and north and south. There’s no barricade you can build around the womb, and one’s enemy will go in and out as he pleases. Thousands of us have the disease and don’t know it. What now, boy?"

      - "If you know aught which does behove my knowledge"
      - "Thereof to be inform’d, imprison’t not"
      - "In ignorant concealment."
    m:
      - "What do you mean, I’ve caught it, too? Don’t tell me I have the deadly stare of the basilisk. I’ve looked at thousands of people who have been better off by having been seen by me, but I’ve never killed anyone that way. Camillo, I know you are a gentleman because you are educated, and that makes one a gentleman as much as having parents who are nobles. I beg you, if you know something I should know, please don’t pretend not to know and keep it from me."

  - sp: CAMILLO
    o:
      - "I may not answer."
    m:
      - "I can’t tell you."

    o:
      - "A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!"
      - "I must be answer’d. Dost thou hear, Camillo,"
      - "I conjure thee, by all the parts of man"
      - "Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least"
      - "Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare"
      - "What incidency thou dost guess of harm"
      - "Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;"
      - "Which way to be prevented, if to be;"
      - "If not, how best to bear it."
    m:
      - "I’ve caught an illness, even though I am well! You have to tell me. Do you hear me, Camillo? I appeal to you by all the traits in a man that respond to honor, including this request itself. Tell me why you think I’m in danger, how close the danger is, and how I might prevent it. Or if I can’t, how I might best endure it."

  - sp: CAMILLO
    o:
      - "Sir, I will tell you;"
      - "Since I am charged in honour and by him"
      - "That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,"
      - "Which must be even as swiftly follow’d as"
      - "I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me"
      - "Cry lost, and so good night!"
    m:
      - "Sir, I will tell you, since I am obligated by my honor and since you’re an honorable man. Therefore listen to my advice, which must be followed immediately, or both you and I will be doomed and will meet a bad end."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "On, good Camillo."
    m:
      - "Go ahead, good Camillo."

    m:
      - "By whom, Camillo?"

    o:
      - "By the king."
    m:
      - "By the king."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "For what?"
    m:
      - "Why?"

  - sp: CAMILLO
    o:
      - "He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,"
      - "As he had seen’t or been an instrument"
      - "To vice you to’t, that you have touch’d his queen"
      - "Forbiddenly."
    m:
      - "He thinks, no, he swears with as much confidence as if he had seen it or even helped you do it, that you have touched his queen in a forbidden way."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "O, then my best blood turn"
      - "To an infected jelly and my name"
      - "Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!"
      - "Turn then my freshest reputation to"
      - "A savour that may strike the dullest nostril"
      - "Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn’d,"
      - "Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection"
      - "That e’er was heard or read!"
    m:
      - "If I did, may my blood turn to poison and my name be as despised as Judas’! Let my reputation rot and stink so badly that even the least sensitive nose will be overwhelmed, and when I approach they’ll turn their backs! Let me be hated more than the worst disease that has ever been heard of!"

    o:
      - "Swear his thought over"
      - "By each particular star in heaven and"
      - "By all their influences, you may as well"
      - "Forbid the sea for to obey the moon"
      - "As or by oath remove or counsel shake"
      - "The fabric of his folly, whose foundation"
      - "Is piled upon his faith and will continue"
      - "The standing of his body."
    m:
      - "No matter how vehemently you swear his suspicions aren’t true, you are as likely to keep the sea from obeying the moon as you are to change his mind. Neither will oaths or wise words disturb the foundation of his foolish notion, which is built on his faith and will last for the rest of his life."

  - sp: POLIXENES
    o:
      - "How should this grow?"
    m:
      - "How did this come about?"

  - sp: CAMILLO
    o:
      - "I know not: but I am sure ’tis safer to"
      - "Avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born."
      - "If therefore you dare trust my honesty,"
      - "That lies enclosed in this trunk which you"
      - "Shall bear along impawn’d, away to-night!"
      - "Your followers I will whisper to the business,"
      - "And will by twos and threes at several posterns"
      - "Clear them o’ the city. For myself, I’ll put"
      - "My fortunes to your service, which are here"
      - "By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;"
      - "For, by the honour of my parents, I"
      - "Have utter’d truth: which if you seek to prove,"
      - "I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer"
      - "Than one condemn’d by the king’s own mouth, thereon"
      - "His execution sworn."
    m:
      - "I don’t know, but I’m sure it’s safer to avoid his jealousy than to wonder why he feels that way. So if you trust my honesty, which you shall take as my pledge, then leave tonight! I’ll quietly let your followers know and get them out of the back gates of the city two or three at a time. As for me, I’ve lost everything I have by revealing this to you, but I’ll put what I have to your service. Don’t be uncertain. By the honor of my parents, I’m telling the truth. If you try to prove it, I’ll deny I ever said it. You won’t be any safer than a man whom the king himself has condemned to be executed."

      - "Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and"
      - "My people did expect my hence departure"
      - "Two days ago. This jealousy"
      - "Is for a precious creature: as she’s rare,"
      - "Must it be great, and as his person’s mighty,"
      - "Must it be violent, and as he does conceive"
      - "He is dishonour’d by a man which ever"
      - "Profess’d to him, why, his revenges must"
      - "In that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me:"
      - "Good expedition be my friend, and comfort"
      - "The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing"
      - "Of his ill-ta’en suspicion! Come, Camillo;"
      - "I will respect thee as a father if"
      - "Thou bear’st my life off hence: let us avoid."
    m:
      - "I do believe you. I saw what he felt in his face. Give me your hand. Guide me and our fortunes will remain together. My ships are ready, and my people expected me to depart two days ago. He’s jealous over a very precious woman, and so his jealousy will be as great as she is rare, and as violent as he is powerful. And since he thinks that a man who always professed friendship has deceived him, his revenge will be even more bitter. I’m overwhelmed with fear. May my swift exit help me, and may it comfort the good queen, who has no responsibility for his unjustified suspicions. Come, Camillo. I will respect you like a father if you take me away safely. Let us leave."
