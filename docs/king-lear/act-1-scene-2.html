<p>Thou, nature, art my goddess. To thy law</p>
<p>My services are bound. Wherefore should I</p>
<p>Stand in the plague of custom and permit</p>
<p>The curiosity of nations to deprive me</p>
<p>For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines</p>
<p>Lag of a brother? Why “bastard”? Wherefore “base”?</p>
<p>When my dimensions are as well compact,</p>
<p>My mind as generous, and my shape as true</p>
<p>As honest madam’s issue? Why brand they us</p>
<p>With “base,” with “baseness,” “bastardy,” “base,” “base”—</p>
<p>Who in the lusty stealth of nature take</p>
<p>More composition and fierce quality</p>
<p>Than doth within a dull, stale, tirèd bed</p>
<p>Go to th’ creating a whole tribe of fops</p>
<p>Got ’tween a sleep and wake? Well then,</p>
<p>Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.</p>
<p>Our father’s love is to the bastard Edmund</p>
<p>As to the legitimate.—Fine word, “legitimate”!—</p>
<p>Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed</p>
<p>And my invention thrive, Edmund the base</p>
<p>Shall top th’ legitimate. I grow, I prosper.</p>
<p>Now, gods, stand up for bastards!</p>

<b>EDMUND</b>
<p>I only worship what’s natural, not what’s manmade. Why should I let myself be tortured by manmade social customs that deprive me of my rights simply because I was born twelve or fourteen months later than my older brother? Why do they call me “bastard” and “lowlife” when I’m just as gifted in mind and body as legitimate children? Why do they call us bastards “lowlifes”? Always “lowlife,” “bastard,” “lowlife,” “lowlife.” At least we bastards were conceived in a moment of passionate lust rather than in a dull, tired marriage bed, where half-sleeping parents monotonously churn out a bunch of sissy kids. All right then, legitimate brother Edgar, I have to have your lands. Our father loves me just as much as the legitimate Edgar. What a nice word that is, “legitimate”! Well, my legitimate Edgar, if this letter works and my plan succeeds, Edmund the lowlife will beat the legitimate. Look out, I’m on my way up. Three cheers for bastards!</p>

<p>These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide, in cities mutinies, in countries discord, in palaces treason, and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction—there’s son against father. The king falls from bias of nature—there’s father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund. It shall lose thee nothing. Do it carefully.—And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished, his offense honesty! ’Tis strange, strange.</p>

<p>These recent eclipses of the sun and moon don’t bode well for us. Though science can explain them away, disasters still come after eclipses. Love cools off, friendships break up, and brothers become enemies. Riots break out, civil war erupts, kings are betrayed, and the bond between father and son snaps. This wicked son of mine confirms the prediction —son against father. The king acts unnaturally—father against child. We’ve seen the best our age has to offer. Conspiracies, fakery, betrayal, and disorder are all that’s left until we die. Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking, Edmund. You won’t lose any respect. Just do it carefully.—And to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished, for the crime of telling the truth! It’s strange, strange.</p>

<p>This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune—often the surfeit of our own behavior—we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if we were villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence, and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting-on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the dragon’s tail and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut, I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar—</p>

As if we become thieves and traitors according to astrological signs or obey planetary influences to become drunks, liars, and adulterers! As if some universal power pushed us into evil deeds! What a sneaky trick it is for lustful mankind to blame our horniness on some star! My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending, and I was born under the Big Dipper, so it’s inevitable that I’m rude and oversexed. Christ!
