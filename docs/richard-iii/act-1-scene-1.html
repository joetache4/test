<b>RICHARD</b>
<p>Now is the winter of our discontent</p>
<p>Made glorious summer by this son of York,</p>
<p>And all the clouds that loured upon our house</p>
<p>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</p>
<p>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,</p>
<p>Our bruisèd arms hung up for monuments,</p>
<p>Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,</p>
<p>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</p>
<p>Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;</p>
<p>And now, instead of mounting barbèd steeds</p>
<p>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</p>
<p>He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber</p>
<p>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</p>
<p>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,</p>
<p>Nor made to court an amorous looking glass;</p>
<p>I, that am rudely stamped and want love’s majesty</p>
<p>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</p>
<p>I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,</p>
<p>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</p>
<p>Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time</p>
<p>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</p>
<p>And that so lamely and unfashionable</p>
<p>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them—</p>
<p>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</p>
<p>Have no delight to pass away the time,</p>
<p>Unless to see my shadow in the sun</p>
<p>And descant on mine own deformity.</p>
<p>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover</p>
<p>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</p>
<p>I am determinèd to prove a villain</p>
<p>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</p>
<p>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</p>
<p>By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,</p>
<p>To set my brother Clarence and the king</p>
<p>In deadly hate, the one against the other;</p>
<p>And if King Edward be as true and just</p>
<p>As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,</p>
<p>This day should Clarence closely be mewed up</p>
<p>About a prophecy which says that “G”</p>
<p>Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.</p>
<p>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.</p>

<b>RICHARD</b>
<p>Now all of my family’s troubles have come to a glorious end, thanks to my brother, King Edward IV. All the clouds that threatened the York family have vanished and turned to sunshine. Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads. We’ve taken off our armor and weapons and hung them up as decorations. Instead of hearing trumpets call us to battle, we dance at parties. We get to wear easy smiles on our faces rather than the grim expressions of war. Instead of charging toward our enemies on armored horses, we dance for our ladies in their chambers, accompanied by sexy songs on the lute. But I’m not made to be a seducer, or to make faces at myself in the mirror. I was badly made and don’t have the looks to strut my stuff in front of pretty sluts. I’ve been cheated of a nice body and face, or even normal proportions. I am deformed, spit out from my mother’s womb prematurely and so badly formed that dogs bark at me as I limp by them. I’m left with nothing to do in this weak, idle peacetime, unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about <em>that</em>. Since I can’t amuse myself by being a lover, I’ve decided to become a villain. I’ve set dangerous plans in motion, using lies, drunken prophecies, and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other. If King Edward is as honest and fair-minded as I am deceitful and cruel, then Clarence is going to be locked away in prison today because of a prophecy that “G” will murder Edward’s children. Oh, time to hide what I’m thinking—here comes Clarence.</p>

<p>His issue disinherited should be.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>CLARENCE</b>
<p>I’ll tell you as soon as I know, Richard, because at this point I have no idea. All I’ve been able to find out is that our brother the king has been listening to prophecies and dreams. He picked out the letter “G” from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that “G” will take the throne away from his children. He thinks “G” is me. I’ve learned that this, along with other frivolous reasons like it, is what prompted the king to send me to prison.</p>

<b>RICHARD</b>
<p>Well, this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women. The king isn’t the one sending you to the Tower, Clarence. It’s his wife, Lady Grey, who got him to do this.

<p>All right. If you like, Brakenbury, you can listen to anything we say. We’re not saying anything treasonous, man.

Then God’s free to send King Edward to heaven, too, and leave me the world to run around in! I’ll marry the earl of Warwick’s youngest daughter, Lady Anne. So what if I killed her husband and her father? The best way to make up for the girl’s losses is to become what she’s lost: a husband and a father. So that’s what I’ll do, not because I love her but because I’ll get something out of it. But I’m running ahead of myself. Clarence is still alive; Edward is not only alive, he’s king.
