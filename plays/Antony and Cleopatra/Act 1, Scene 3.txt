  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Where is he?"
    m:
      - "Where is he?"

  - sp: CHARMIAN
    o:
      - "    I did not see him since."
    m:
      - "I haven’t seen him recently."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "*(to ALEXAS)* See where he is, who’s with him, what he does."
      - "I did not send you. If you find him sad,"
      - "Say I am dancing. If in mirth, report"
      - "That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return."
    m:
      - "*(to ALEXAS)* Find out where he is, who’s with him, and what he’s doing. Don’t tell him I sent you. If he’s sad, tell him I’m dancing. If he’s happy, say that I’ve suddenly taken sick. Hurry, and come back."

  - os: "Exit ALEXAS"
    ms: "ALEXAS exits."

  - sp: CHARMIAN
    o:
      - "Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,"
      - "You do not hold the method to enforce"
      - "The like from him."
    m:
      - "Madam, I think if you love him so much, you aren’t using the best way to get him to reciprocate."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    What should I do I do not?"
    m:
      - "What should I do that I’m not doing?"

  - sp: CHARMIAN
    o:
      - "In each thing give him way. Cross him in nothing."
    m:
      - "Always give him his way. Never contradict him."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him."
    m:
      - "You advise me like a fool. That’s the way to lose him."

  - sp: CHARMIAN
    o:
      - "Tempt him not so too far. I wish, forbear."
      - "In time we hate that which we often fear."
    m:
      - "Don’t push him too far. I wish you’d be patient. We come to hate that which controls us."

  - os: "Enter ANTONY"
    ms: "ANTONY enters."

  - o:
      - "But here comes Antony."
    m:
      - "But here comes Antony."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    I am sick and sullen."
    m:
      - "I am sick and sullen."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose—"
    m:
      - "I’m sorry to have to say this—"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Help me away, dear Charmian! I shall fall."
      - "It cannot be thus long. The sides of nature"
      - "Will not sustain it."
    m:
      - "Help me away from here, dear Charmian! I shall faint. I won’t be able to go on this way much longer. Human nature isn’t built to withstand this."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "    Now, my dearest Queen—"
    m:
      - "Now, my dearest Queen—"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Pray you, stand farther from me."
    m:
      - "Please, stand farther away from me."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "    What’s the matter?"
    m:
      - "What’s the matter?"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "I know by that same eye there’s some good news."
      - "What, says the married woman you may go?"
      - "Would she had never given you leave to come!"
      - "Let her not say ’tis I that keep you here."
      - "I have no power upon you. Hers you are."
    m:
      - "I can see in your eyes there’s been some good news. What, does your wife say you can come home? I wish she’d never let you come. Don’t let her say I kept you. I have no power over you. You belong to her."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "The gods best know—"
    m:
      - "The gods know—"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    Oh never was there queen"
      - "So mightily betrayed! Yet at the first"
      - "I saw the treasons planted."
    m:
      - "Oh, never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been. I knew from the first it would be this way."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "    Cleopatra—"
    m:
      - "Cleopatra—"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Why should I think you can be mine, and true—"
      - "Though you in swearing shake the thronèd gods—"
      - "Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,"
      - "To be entangled with those mouth-made vows"
      - "Which break themselves in swearing!"
    m:
      - "How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true, even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves—you, who were unfaithful to Fulvia? It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart. Such false vows are broken as soon as they are spoken."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "    Most sweet Queen—"
    m:
      - "Most sweet Queen—"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Nay, pray you, seek no color for your going,"
      - "But bid farewell and go. When you sued staying,"
      - "Then was the time for words. No going then!"
      - "Eternity was in our lips and eyes,"
      - "Bliss in our brows’ bent, none our parts so poor"
      - "But was a race of heaven. They are so still,"
      - "Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,"
      - "Art turned the greatest liar."
    m:
      - "No, please don’t try to excuse your departure. Just say good-bye and go. When you begged to stay, that was the time for words. You didn’t want to go then! You saw eternity in my lips and eyes, and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows. Then, all my parts seemed angelic to you. My features are still that beautiful—or else you, the greatest soldier in the world, have become the greatest liar by overpraising them."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "    How now, lady?"
    m:
      - "What do you mean, lady?"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know"
      - "There were a heart in Egypt."
    m:
      - "I wish I were as big and strong as you. Then you’d see the courage that lives in the Queen of Egypt."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "    Hear me, Queen:"
      - "The strong necessity of time commands"
      - "Our services awhile, but my full heart"
      - "Remains in use with you. Our Italy"
      - "Shines o’er with civil swords. Sextus Pompeius"
      - "Makes his approaches to the port of Rome."
      - "Equality of two domestic powers"
      - "Breed scrupulous faction. The hated, grown to strength,"
      - "Are newly grown to love. The condemned Pompey,"
      - "Rich in his father’s honor, creeps apace"
      - "Into the hearts of such as have not thrived"
      - "Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;"
      - "And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge"
      - "By any desperate change. My more particular,"
      - "And that which most with you should safe my going,"
      - "Is Fulvia’s death."
    m:
      - "Listen to me, Queen. There is an emergency I must take care of, but my whole heart will remain here with you. My Italy is full of civil war. Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome. When two domestic opponents are equally matched—as we are against Pompey—factions will form on the smallest of pretexts. When a formerly hated man grows powerful, he suddenly finds himself with many supporters. Pompey, who was once condemned, now wields his father’s power, and all the citizens who have grievances against the government are joining him. Pompey’s numbers are steadily growing, and the government is ready to do something desperate. But my personal motivation—and that which should move you most to sanction my departure—is that Fulvia is dead."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Though age from folly could not give me freedom,"
      - "It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?"
    m:
      - "I may not have outlived the foolishness of my youth, but I’m not that childishly naïve. Is it possible Fulvia is dead?"

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "She’s dead, my Queen."
    m:
      - "She’s dead, my Queen."

  - os: "He offers letters"
    ms: "He shows her the message."

  - o:
      - "Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read"
      - "The garboils she awaked, at the last, best,"
      - "See when and where she died."
    m:
      - "Look at this. Take your royal time and read about the quarrels she encouraged. And saving the best for last, read when and where she died."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    O most false love!"
      - "Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill"
      - "With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,"
      - "In Fulvia’s death how mine received shall be."
    m:
      - "Oh, unfaithful lover! You should be filling vials with your tears. Seeing how you take Fulvia’s death, I can see how you would react to mine."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know"
      - "The purposes I bear, which are or cease"
      - "As you shall give th’ advice. By the fire"
      - "That quickens Nilus’ slime, I go from hence"
      - "Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war"
      - "As thou affects."
    m:
      - "Stop arguing and listen to my plans. Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you. I swear by the sun that when I leave here, it will be as your faithful servant. I will make either peace or war, whichever you prefer."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Cut my lace, Charmian, come!"
      - "But let it be. I am quickly ill, and well,"
      - "So Antony loves."
    m:
      - "Cut my corset laces, Charmian, so I can breathe. Hurry! No, leave it alone. I waver easily between sickness and health. Just as Antony loves."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "My precious Queen, forbear,"
      - "And give true evidence to his love which stands"
      - "An honorable trial."
    m:
      - "Control yourself, my precious Queen, and concede that my love is true. It has endured many genuine trials."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "So Fulvia told me."
      - "I prithee, turn aside and weep for her."
      - "Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears"
      - "Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene"
      - "Of excellent dissembling, and let it look"
      - "Like perfect honor."
    m:
      - "That’s what Fulvia told me. I beg you, turn away and cry for her. Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit. Good. Now perform a scene for me, using your excellent skills of playacting, and pretend that you’re being honorable and righteous."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "    You’ll heat my blood. No more."
    m:
      - "You’ll make me angry. No more of this."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "You can do better yet, but this is meetly."
    m:
      - "I know you can do better than that, but it’ll do for now."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "Now, by my sword—"
    m:
      - "I swear by my sword—"

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    And target. Still he mends."
      - "*(to CHARMIAN)* But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,"
      - "How this Herculean Roman does become"
      - "The carriage of his chafe."
    m:
      - "Swear by your shield, too! *(to CHARMIAN)* He’s getting better, but still it’s not his best. See, Charmian, how well this mighty Roman portrays anger?"

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "I’ll leave you, lady."
    m:
      - "I’ll leave you, lady."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "Courteous lord, one word."
      - "Sir, you and I must part, but that’s not it."
      - "Sir, you and I have loved, but there’s not it,"
      - "That you know well. Something it is I would—"
      - "Oh, my oblivion is a very Antony,"
      - "And I am all forgotten."
    m:
      - "Polite sir, let me say one thing. Sir, you and I must part company—no, that’s not it. Sir, you and I were lovers—no, that’s not it, either. You already know all that. There’s something I’d like to—oh, I’ve forgotten what I wanted to say. Just as Antony has forgotten me."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "    But that your royalty"
      - "Holds idleness your subject, I should take you"
      - "For idleness itself."
    m:
      - "If you weren’t the queen of immaturity, I’d think you were immaturity itself."

  - sp: CLEOPATRA
    o:
      - "    ’Tis sweating labor"
      - "To bear such idleness so near the heart"
      - "As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me,"
      - "Since my becomings kill me when they do not"
      - "Eye well to you. Your honor calls you hence."
      - "Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,"
      - "And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword"
      - "Sit laurel victory, and smooth success"
      - "Be strewed before your feet."
    m:
      - "It’s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart, but bear with me. Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don’t approve of them. Your honor is the reason you are leaving. So I beg you not to listen to my foolishness. May the gods be with you. May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "    Let us go. Come."
      - "Our separation so abides and flies"
      - "That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,"
      - "And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee."
      - "Away!"
    m:
      - "Let’s go. Come with me. Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here, you come with me, and even though I leave here, I stay with you."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
