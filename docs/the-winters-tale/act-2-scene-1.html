There may be a spider in your cup, and if you drink without realizing it, you aren’t hurt. But if you see the spider and know you have drunk it, you will wretch and heave violently. I have drunk from the cup, and I know that the spider was in it. Camillo helped him and acted as his pimp. There is a plot to kill me and take my place as king. Everything that I suspected is true. That traitorous villain I employed actually worked for Polixenes. He has discovered my plan, and I’m still tormented, a toy for them to play with. How were the gates so easily opened?</p>

<p>My lords, look at her closely. If you are tempted to say, “She is a fine lady,” the wisdom of your hearts will add, “A shame that she isn’t virtuous or honorable.” Praise her for anything but her outward form, which does deserve praise, and immediately you must shrug or mutter to yourself. Those are the expressions that slander uses—no, I’m wrong—that mercy uses, because slander only attacks someone who is virtuous. These shrugs and mutterings after you say, “She’s goodly” interrupt you before you can say, “She’s virtuous.” Listen to the man who has the most reason to be upset about it: she’s an adulteress.</p>

<p>Why do I have to debate this with you, instead of just following my own strong impulse?  As king I’m not required to seek your advice, though I tell you this information out of natural goodness. But if you, who are either confused or pretend to be, can’t understand the truth as I do, then I don’t need any more of your advice. The entire affair is in my hands.</p>

<p>How could that be?</p>
<p>Either thou art most ignorant by age,</p>
<p>Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo’s flight,</p>
<p>Added to their familiarity,</p>
<p>Which was as gross as ever touch’d conjecture,</p>
<p>That lack’d sight only, nought for approbation</p>
<p>But only seeing, all other circumstances</p>
<p>Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:</p>
<p>Yet, for a greater confirmation,</p>
<p>For in an act of this importance ’twere</p>
<p>Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch’d in post</p>
<p>To sacred Delphos, to Apollo’s temple,</p>
<p>Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know</p>
<p>Of stuff’d sufficiency: now from the oracle</p>
<p>They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,</p>
<p>Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?</p>

<p>How do you mean? Either you have become a fool with age, or you were born that way. Camillo’s fleeing and their intimacy, which was as obvious as any suspicion that lacked only an eyewitness to confirm it, together push this matter forward. Still, since this is a serious matter and shouldn’t be handled rashly, I’ve sent Cleomenes and Dion to get further confirmation at Apollo’s temple in Delphos. You know they are competent. They’ll bring word from the oracle, and I’ll heed whatever advice it gives, whether for or against my suspicion. Is that good?</p>

<p>Even though I am sure that I am right, the oracle will convince everyone else, such as those who find themselves unable to accept the truth. So I have thought it a good idea to confine her and keep her away from me, so the treachery of Camillo and Polixenes is not left to her to perform. Come, follow me. I’m going to speak to the public, since this matter will incite everyone to action.</p>
