    o:
      - "Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew, my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me, “Gobbo,” “Launcelot Gobbo,” “Good Launcelot,” or “Good Gobbo,” or “Good Launcelot Gobbo” —“use your legs, take the start, run away.” My conscience says, “No. Take heed, honest Launcelot. Take heed, honest Gobbo,” or as aforesaid, “Honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not run. Scorn running with thy heels.” Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. “Fia!” says the fiend. “Away!” says the fiend. “For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend, “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, “My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to. He had a kind of taste.—Well, my conscience says, “Launcelot, budge not.” “Budge!” says the fiend. “Budge not,” says my conscience. “Conscience,” say I, “you counsel well.” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.” To be ruled by my conscience I should stay with the Jew my master, who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil. And to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation. And in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel. I will run, fiend. My heels are at your command. I will run."
    m:
      - "I’m sure I’ll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew, my master. The devil’s on my shoulder, tempting me. He’s saying, “Gobbo,” “Launcelot Gobbo,” “Good Launcelot,” or “Good Gobbo,” or “Good Launcelot Gobbo”—“use your legs and run away.” But my conscience says, “No, Launcelot, calm down, don’t run away.” The devil’s urging me to leave. “Go away!” he says. “Run away! Be tough,” says the devil, “and run!” But then my conscience, hanging around my heart, says very wisely to me, “My good friend Launcelot, you’re a good boy, the son of an honest man,” really, that should be the son of an honest woman, since my father cheated on my mother. Anyway, my conscience says, “Stay put.” “Go,” the devil says. “Don’t go,” says my conscience. “Conscience,” I say, “you give good advice.” “Devil,” I say, “you give good advice.” If I listened to my conscience, I’d stay with the Jew my master, who’s a devil. But if I ran away from the Jew, I’d be following the advice of the devil, who’s the very devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the devil incarnate, and my conscience is giving me a hard time by telling me to stay with the Jew. The devil’s advice is nicer. I’ll run, devil. Tell me to run, and I’ll run."

    m:
      - "*(to himself)* Good heavens, it’s my father. He doesn’t recognize me because he’s half-blind—or more than half-blind, somewhere between half-blind and totally blind. I’ll play a little game with him."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:

    m:
      - "Turn right at the next turn, but at the following turn, turn left. Oh, and then at the very next turn, don’t turn left or right, but turn down and around to the Jew’s house."

  - sp: GOBBO
    o:
      - "By God’s sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit. Can you tell me whether one Launcelot that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?"
    m:
      - "Good heavens, those are difficult directions. Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot, who lives with him, is still there?"

  - sp: GOBBO
    o:
      - "No “master,” sir, but a poor man’s son. His father, though I say ’t, is an honest exceeding poor man and, God be thanked, well to live."
    m:
      - "He’s not a “master,” sir, he’s just a poor man’s son. His father, if I do say so myself, is an honest but very poor man, and, thank God, likely to live a long time."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "Well, let his father be what he will, we talk of young"

    m:

  - sp: GOBBO
    o:
      - "Of Launcelot, an ’t please your mastership."
    m:
      - "Yes, I’m talking about Launcelot, sir."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot, Father, for the young gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of learning, is indeed deceased, or as you would say in plain terms, gone to heaven."
    m:
      - "Ergo , Master Launcelot. But please don’t talk about Master Launcelot, old man. The young gentleman, submitting to the fates, the three sisters who control destiny, and other branches of learning like that, is deceased. Or, to put it in plain language, he’s gone to heaven."

    o:
      - "Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop."

    o:
      - "Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman. But I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?"
    m:

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "Nay, indeed if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me. It is a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing. Truth will come to light. Murder cannot be hid long—a man’s son may, but in the end truth will out."
    m:
      - "Even if you had your eyes, you still might not recognize me. It takes a wise father to know his own child. Well, old man, I’ll tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing. The truth will come to light, and murder can’t be hidden long—a man’s son may hide, but truth will always come out."

  - sp: GOBBO
    o:
      - "Pray you, sir, stand up. I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy."
    m:
      - "Please stand up! I’m sure you aren’t Launcelot, my boy."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "Pray you, let’s have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing. I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be."
    m:
      - "Come on, quit fooling around. Give me your blessing. I’m Launcelot, who was your boy, is your son, and will be your child."

  - sp: GOBBO
    o:
      - "I cannot think you are my son."
    m:
      - "I can’t believe you’re my son."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "I know not what I shall think of that. But I am Launcelot, the Jew’s man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother."
    m:
      - "I don’t know what to say to that, but the fact is I’m Launcelot, the Jew’s servant, and Margery, your wife, is my mother."

  - sp: GOBBO
    o:
      - "Her name is Margery, indeed. I’ll be sworn, if thou be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood. *(feels theback of LAUNCELOT’s head)* Lord worshipped might he be, what a beard hast thou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail."
    m:
      - "Yes, you’re right, her name is Margery. If you’re Launcelot, then you’re my own flesh and blood. *(feels the back of LAUNCELOT’s head)* My Lord, what a bushy beard you have! You’ve got more hair on your chin than Dobbin my horse has in his tail."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "It should seem then that Dobbin’s tail grows backward. I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him."
    m:

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "Well, well, but for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground. My master’s a very Jew. Give him a present. Give him a halter. I am famished in his service. You may tell every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come. Give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground.—O rare fortune! Here comes the man.—To him, Father, for I am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer."
    m:
      - "I’m all right. But I’ve decided to run away, and I can’t wait to get going. My master’s a total Jew. You’re giving him a present? Give him a noose to hang himself. He’s starving me to death. You can see my ribs so well you can count them. I’m glad you’ve come, father. Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio. He gives his servants beautiful new uniforms. If I can’t get a job with him, I’ll run away to the ends of the earth.—Oh look, this is lucky, here comes Master Bassanio now.—Let’s go talk to him, Father. If I work for the Jew any longer, you can just call me a Jew."

And then to ’scape drowning thrice and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed—here are simple ’scapes. Well, if Fortune be a woman, she’s a good wench for this gear.—Father, come.

It seems I’ll almost drown three times, and my life will be in danger when I’m caught in bed with another man’s wife! But these little lines are the escape routes I can take to get out of that one.
