  - os: "Enter, meeting, SPEED and LANCE with his dog Crab"
    ms: "SPEED and LANCE, with his dog, Crab, enter and meet."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Lance, by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!"
    m:
      - "Lance, honestly, welcome to Milan!"

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say “Welcome!”"
    m:
      - "Don’t lie, my friend, because I am not welcome. I always believe a man is never sunk until he’s hanged, nor ever welcome to a place until the bill has been paid and the hostess says, “Welcome!”"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Come on, you madcap, I’ll to the alehouse with you presently, where, for one shot of five pence, thou shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how did thy master part with Madam Julia?"
    m:
      - "Come you, you lunatic, I’ll go to the pub with you soon, where you can have five thousand welcomes for five pence. But tell me, pal, how did your master say goodbye to Madame Julia?"

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very fairly in jest."
    m:
      - "You know, after they said their earnest goodbyes, they parted with a few jokes."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "But shall she marry him?"
    m:
      - "But will she marry him?"

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "No."
    m:
      - "No."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "How then? Shall he marry her?"
    m:
      - "What then? Will he marry her?"

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "No, neither."
    m:
      - "No, not that either."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "What, are they broken?"
    m:
      - "What, have they broken up?"

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "No, they are both as whole as a fish."
    m:
      - "No, they’re as whole as ever."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Why, then, how stands the matter with them?"
    m:
      - "Well, then, where do they stand on the matter?"

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it stands well with her."
    m:
      - "Indeed, that’s the way it is: when he stands erect, he’s in good standing with her."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "What an ass art thou! I understand thee not."
    m:
      - "What an ass you are! I don’t understand you."

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My staff understands me."
    m:
      - "What a blockhead you are, since you can’t understand me! My wooden staff understands me."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "What thou sayest?"
    m:
      - "What are you talking about?"

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "Ay, and what I do too. Look thee, I’ll but lean, and my staff understands me."
    m:
      - "Yes, and it’s what I do, too. Look here—I simply have to lean, and my staff understands me."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "It stands under thee, indeed."
    m:
      - "It stands under you, indeed."

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one."
    m:
      - "Well, standing-under, under-standing—it’s all the same."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "But tell me true, will ’t be a match?"
    m:
      - "But tell me honestly, will they get married?"

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "Ask my dog. If he say ay, it will; if he say no, it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will."
    m:
      - "Ask my dog. If he says yes, then they will. If he says no, then they will. If he shakes his tail and says nothing, then they will."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "The conclusion is then that it will."
    m:
      - "So no matter what then, they will get married."

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable."
    m:
      - "You’ll never get me to reveal the secret except in riddles."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "’Tis well that I get it so. But, Lance, how sayest thou, that my master is become a notable lover?"
    m:
      - "It’s best that I find out that way. But, Lance, what can you tell me about the fact that my master has become a well-known lover?"

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "I never knew him otherwise."
    m:
      - "I never knew him otherwise."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Than how?"
    m:
      - "Than what?"

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be."
    m:
      - "A well-known lubber —and idiot, as you’ve told me he is."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistak’st me."
    m:
      - "Why, you jackass son of a whore! You misunderstand me."

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "Why, fool, I meant not thee. I meant thy master."
    m:
      - "Why, fool, I didn’t mean you. I meant your master."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover."
    m:
      - "I tell you, my master has become an excellent lover."

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "Why, I tell thee I care not, though he burn himself in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse; if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the name of a Christian."
    m:
      - "Well, I tell you that I don’t really care, even if he burns himself from being so “hot” in love. Come with me to the pub if you will. If not, then you’re a Hebrew, a Jew, and not worthy to be called a Christian."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Why?"
    m:
      - "Why?"

  - sp: LANCE
    o:
      - "Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?"
    m:
      - "Because you don’t even have enough compassion in you to go to the church’s ale festival with a Christian. So, are you coming?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "At thy service."
    m:
      - "I’m at your service."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
