  - os: "Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA"
    ms: "SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA enter."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "What a plague means my niece, to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care’s an enemy to life."
    m:
      - "What’s wrong with my niece? Why is she reacting so strangely to her brother’s death? Grief is bad for people’s health."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o’ nights. Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours."
    m:
      - "For God’s sake, Sir Toby, you’ve got to come home earlier at night. My lady Olivia, your niece, disapproves of your late-night partying."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Why, let her except, before excepted."
    m:
      - "Well, she can get used to it."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order."
    m:
      - "Yes, but you need to keep yourself within the limits of order and decency."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Confine? I’ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too. An they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps."
    m:
      - "Keep myself? The only thing I’m keeping myself in is the clothes I’m wearing. They’re good enough to drink in, and so are these boots. If they aren’t, they can go hang themselves by their own laces!"

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer."
    m:
      - "You’re going to destroy yourself with all this drinking. Lady Olivia said so yesterday. She also mentioned some stupid knight you brought in one night as a possible husband for her."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?"
    m:
      - "Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?"

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Ay, he."
    m:
      - "Yes, that’s the one."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "He’s as tall a man as any ’s in Illyria."
    m:
      - "He’s as tall as a man in Illyria."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "What’s that to the purpose?"
    m:
      - "What does his height have to do with anything?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Why, he has three thousand ducats a year."
    m:
      - "Why, he has an income of three thousand ducats a year."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Ay, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats. He’s a very fool and a prodigal."
    m:
      - "I bet he’ll spend his whole inheritance in a year. He’s a fool and a spendthrift."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Fie, that you’ll say so! He plays o’ the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature."
    m:
      - "You shouldn’t talk about him like that! He plays the violin and speaks three or four languages word for word without a dictionary. He has all of nature’s best gifts."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "He hath indeed, almost natural, for besides that he’s a fool, he’s a great quarreler, and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarreling, ’tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave."
    m:
      - "Right—he’s a natural-born idiot. Besides being a fool, he’s argumentative. If he didn’t have the coward’s gift for backing down from a fight, they say he’d be dead by now."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him. Who are they?"
    m:
      - "Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage. Who said that?"

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company."
    m:
      - "The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "With drinking healths to my niece. I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria. He’s a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’ th’ toe like a parish top. What, wench! *Castiliano vulgo*, for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface."
    m:
      - "We only drink toasts to my niece. I’ll drink to her as long as there’s a hole in my throat and booze in Illyria. Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum. But speak of the devil, here comes Sir Andrew Agueface."

  - os: "Enter SIR ANDREW"
    ms: "SIR ANDREW enters."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch!"
    m:
      - "Sir Toby Belch! How are you, Sir Toby Belch?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Sweet Sir Andrew!"
    m:
      - "Sweet Sir Andrew!"

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "*(to MARIA)* Bless you, fair shrew."
    m:
      - "*(to MARIA)* And hello to you, my little wench."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "And you too, sir."
    m:
      - "Hello, sir."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Accost, Sir Andrew, accost."
    m:
      - "Chat her up, Sir Andrew. Chat her up."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "What’s that?"
    m:
      - "What?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "My niece’s chambermaid."
    m:
      - "This is my niece’s maid."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance."
    m:
      - "My dear Miss Chat-her-up, I look forward to getting to know you better."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "My name is Mary, sir."
    m:
      - "My name is Mary, sir."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "Good Mistress Mary Accost—"
    m:
      - "Miss Mary Chat-her-up—"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "You mistake, knight. “Accost” is front her, board her, woo her, assail her."
    m:
      - "No, you’ve got it wrong. When I said “chat her up,” I wasn’t saying her name. I was telling you to go after her, woo her, confront her."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of “accost”?"
    m:
      - "Good heavens, I’d never do that with people watching. Is that really what you meant?"

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Fare you well, gentlemen. *(she starts to exit)*"
    m:
      - "Goodbye, gentlemen. *(she starts to exit)*"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again."
    m:
      - "She’s leaving. If you let her go this easily, Sir Andrew, you don’t deserve to ever use your sword again."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?"
    m:
      - "If you leave like this, my dear, I won’t ever use my sword again. I’m not just talking nonsense to you, I mean everything I say. Do you think you’ve got a couple of fools on your hands here?"

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Sir, I have not you by the hand."
    m:
      - "I’m not holding your hand, sir."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "Marry, but you shall have, and here’s my hand."
      - "*(he offers her his hand)*"
    m:
      - "But you will. Here’s my hand. *(he offers her his hand)*"

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "*(taking his hand)* Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink."
    m:
      - "*(taking his hand)* A girl’s got a right to her opinions. Take your hand to a bar and put a drink in it."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "Wherefore, sweetheart? What’s your metaphor?"
    m:
      - "Why, sweetheart? Is there a hidden meaning in this?"

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "It’s dry, sir."
    m:
      - "You’re not holding a glass. Your hand is dry, sir."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "Why, I think so. I am not such an ass, but I can keep my hand dry. But what’s your jest?"
    m:
      - "Well, I hope so. I’m not such an idiot that I can’t keep my hands dry. But I don’t get it—what’s the joke?"

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "A dry jest, sir."
    m:
      - "Just a bit of my dry humor, sir."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "Are you full of them?"
    m:
      - "Are you always so funny?"

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers’ ends. Marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren."
    m:
      - "Yes, I’ve got a handful of jokes. But oops, when I let go of your hand, I let go of the biggest joke of all."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "MARIA exits."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "O knight, thou lackest a cup of canary. When did I see thee so put down?"
    m:
      - "Sir, you need a drink. When has anyone ever put you down like that."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has. But I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit."
    m:
      - "Never. I’ve only been that far down when I’ve drunk myself under the table. Sometimes I think I’m no smarter than average. I eat a lot of red meat, and maybe that makes me stupid."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "No question."
    m:
      - "Absolutely."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "An I thought that, I’d forswear it. I’ll ride home tomorrow,"
      - "Sir Toby."
    m:
      - "If I really believed that, I’d give up red meat totally. By the way, I’m going home tomorrow, Sir Toby."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "*Pourquoi,* my dear knight?"
    m:
      - "Pourquoi, my friend?"

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "What is “pourquoi”? Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O, had I but followed the arts!"
    m:
      - "What does *“pourquoi”* mean? Does it mean I will or I won’t? Oh, I wish I’d spent as much time learning languages as I spent on fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting! If only I’d taken school more seriously!"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair."
    m:
      - "You’d have a great hairstyle if you had."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "Why, would that have mended my hair?"
    m:
      - "Why, would that have fixed my hair?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature."
    m:
      - "Oh, no question—it won’t style itself."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "But it becomes me well enough, does ’t not?"
    m:
      - "But my hair looks good anyway, doesn’t it?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Excellent. It hangs like flax on a distaff. And I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off."
    m:
      - "It looks great. It hangs like an old worn-out mop. Some woman should give you syphilis so you go bald."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will not be seen. Or if she be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me. The count himself here hard by woos her."
    m:
      - "Listen, I’m going home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your niece is refusing to see anyone, and even if she saw me, ten to one she’d want nothing to do with me. That duke who lives nearby is courting her."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "She’ll none o’ the count. She’ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit. I have heard her swear ’t. Tut, there’s life in ’t, man."
    m:
      - "She’s not interested in the duke. She doesn’t want to marry anyone of higher social rank than her, or anyone richer, older, or smarter. I’ve heard her say that. So cheer up, there’s still hope for you, man."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "I’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o’ th’ strangest mind i’ th’ world. I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether."
    m:
      - "All right, I’ll stay another month. Ah, I’m an odd kind of guy. Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?"
    m:
      - "Are you good at those kinds of things?"

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters. And yet I will not compare with an old man."
    m:
      - "Yes, as good as any man in Illyria, except for the ones who are better at it than I am. I’m not as good as someone who’s been dancing for years."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?"
    m:
      - "How good are you at those fast dances?"

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "Faith, I can cut a caper."
    m:
      - "Believe me, I can cut a caper."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "And I can cut the mutton to ’t."
    m:
      - "And I can cut some meat to go with your capers."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria."
    m:
      - "And I can do that fancy backward step as well as any man in Illyria."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before ’em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig. I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard."
    m:
      - "Why do you hide these things? Why do you keep these talents behind a curtain? Are they likely to get dusty? Why don’t you go off to church dancing one way, and come home dancing another way? If I had your talents, I’d be dancing a jig every time I walked down the street. I wouldn’t even pee without dancing a waltz. What are you thinking? Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments? You’re a born dancer. Look how shapely your legs are."

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "Ay, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dun-colored stock. Shall we set about some revels?"
    m:
      - "That’s true. They’re strong, and they look pretty good in brown tights. Should we throw a little dance party?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?"
    m:
      - "Why not? Weren’t we both born under Taurus?"

  - sp: SIR ANDREW
    o:
      - "Taurus! That’s sides and heart."
    m:
      - "Taurus! That governs the torso and heart, doesn’t it?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see the caper. Ha, higher! Ha, ha, excellent!"
    m:
      - "No, the legs and thighs. Let me see you dance. *(SIR ANDREW dances)* Ha, higher! Ha, ha, excellent!"

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
