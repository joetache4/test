<b>KING OF FRANCE</b>
<p>Thus comes the English with full power upon us,</p>

<p>And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,</p>
<p>To line and new-repair our towns of war</p>
<p>With men of courage and with means defendant.</p>

<b>KING OF FRANCE</b>
<p>The English army is advancing on us at full strength. It is more important that we respond majestically than that we respond carefully. Therefore the dukes of Berri, Bretagne, Brabant, and Orléans shall advance, and you, Prince Dauphin, will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves. The king of England’s approach is as forceful as a whirlpool. It is right for us to prepare like people who are afraid, as we’ve been taught by the recent lessons given us by the deadly and underestimated English on our own soil.</p>

<p>And let us do it with no show of fear,</p>
<p>No, with no more than if we heard that England</p>
<p>Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance.</p>
<p>For, my good liege, she is so idly kinged,</p>
<p>Her scepter so fantastically borne</p>
<p>By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,</p>
<p>That fear attends her not.</p>
<p>My most redoubted father,</p>
<p>It is most meet we arm us ’gainst the foe,</p>
<p>For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,</p>
<p>Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,</p>
<p>But that defenses, musters, preparations,</p>
<p>Should be maintained, assembled, and collected,</p>
<p>As were a war in expectation.</p>
<p>Therefore I say ’tis meet we all go forth</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>DAUPHIN</b>
<p>My most feared father, it is certainly appropriate for us to arm ourselves against the enemy, because even in peace time, when no war or conflict is at hand, a kingdom should not lose its edge, but always be ready—with defenses, men, and training—as though it expected a war. Therefore, I agree that we should all go and inspect those French territories that are weak. Let’s do it with no show of anxiety—no, with no more fear than if we’d heard that the English were busying themselves with folk dancing. Because, my good king, England is so poorly led, her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain, silly, shallow, impulsive youth, that she’s hardly a threat.</p>

<p>Oh peace, Prince Dauphin!</p>
<p>You are too much mistaken in this king.</p>
<p>Question your Grace the late ambassadors</p>
<p>With what great state he heard their embassy,</p>
<p>How well supplied with noble counselors,</p>
<p>How modest in exception, and withal</p>
<p>How terrible in constant resolution,</p>
<p>And you shall find his vanities forespent</p>
<p>Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,</p>

<b>CONSTABLE</b>
<p>Oh, please, Prince Dauphin! You are completely wrong about this king. Talk to the ambassadors who’ve just come back: ask them how majestically he responded to their message, how well supplied he was with good advisors, how restrained in expressing his displeasure, and, moreover, how terrifyingly firm he was in his resolve. You’ll discover that his youthful follies were like the persona that Lucius Junius Brutus adopted to deceive Tarquin—cloaking wisdom in folly the way gardeners cover the most delicate roots with manure when they first sprout up.</p>

<p>Well, ’tis not so, my Lord High Constable.</p>
<p>But though we think it so, it is no matter.</p>
<p>In cases of defense ’tis best to weigh</p>
<p>The enemy more mighty than he seems.</p>
<p>So the proportions of defense are filled,</p>

<b>DAUPHIN</b>
<p>Well, you’re wrong, my Lord High Constable. But even if I thought you were right, it doesn’t matter. When it comes to defense, it’s best to assume that the enemy is more powerful than he seems. That way, we fill the gaps in our defenses. Otherwise, if we do it on the cheap, we’ll be like the miser who spoils his new coat by not buying quite enough cloth to make it.</p>

<p>Think we King Harry strong,</p>
<p>And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.</p>
<p>The kindred of him hath been fleshed upon us,</p>
<p>And he is bred out of that bloody strain</p>
<p>That haunted us in our familiar paths.</p>
<p>Witness our too-much-memorable shame</p>
<p>When Cressy battle fatally was struck</p>
<p>And all our princes captived by the hand</p>
<p>Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales,</p>
<p>Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing</p>
<p>Up in the air, crowned with the golden sun,</p>
<p>Saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him</p>
<p>Mangle the work of nature and deface</p>
<p>The patterns that by God and by French fathers</p>
<p>Had twenty years been made. This is a stem</p>
<p>Of that victorious stock, and let us fear</p>
<p>The native mightiness and fate of him.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>KING OF FRANCE</b>
<p>I think King Harry is strong, so the rest of you princes make sure to arm yourselves to meet him with strength. His ancestors got their first taste of blood in battle with us, and he is born of that warlike strain that haunted us on our home ground. Reflect on the battle of Crécy, where, to our everlasting shame, all our princes were taken prisoner by the Prince of Wales, he whom they called Edward the Black Prince. Remember how his mountain-bred father, standing high on a mountain, crowned by the golden sun, observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature, French youth whose fathers and God had nurtured for twenty years, since they were babies. This king is a branch of that same victorious stock. So let us be wary both of his inborn might and of his destiny.</p>

Relinquish the stolen titles that, by the gift of heaven and the laws of nature and of nations, belong to him and his heirs. That is, give up the crown and all the extensive titles that go with it, according to custom and long use. So that you’ll know this is no dubious or farfetched claim, he sends you his family tree, every line of which supports the claim. Look over this document, and when you see that he is directly descended from his most famous of famous ancestors, Edward the Third, he demands that you resign your crown and kingdom, which you wrongfully hold at the expense of himself, the true and natural owner.</p>

<p>Bloodshed will force you to. No matter how deeply you hid the crown, even if you hid it in your own hearts, he’d dig it up. That’s why he’s coming after you like a fierce storm, with thunder and earthquakes like Jove could stir up. So, if asking you for the crown doesn’t work, he will force you to give it to him. In the name of God, then, he asks that you deliver up the crown. He says to take pity on the poor souls whom this ravenous war will swallow up. The widows’ tears, the orphans’ cries, the dead men’s blood, the girls mourning for their husbands, the fathers and the men they might have married will all be your fault.
