<p>Things have turned out so unluckily, sir, that we haven’t had time to convince our daughter to marry you. Listen, she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly, and so did I. Well, we were all born to die. It’s very late, she won’t be coming downstairs tonight. Believe me, if you weren’t here visiting me, I myself would have gone to bed an hour ago.</p>

<p>Sir Paris, I’ll make a desperate argument for my child’s love. I think she’ll do whatever I say. No, I think she’ll do all that and more. I have no doubt about it.

<p>Monday! Ha, ha. Well, Wednesday is too soon,</p>

<p>Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?</p>
<p>We’ll keep no great ado, a friend or two.</p>
<p>For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,</p>
<p>It may be thought we held him carelessly,</p>
<p>Being our kinsman, if we revel much.</p>
<p>Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,</p>
<p>And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?</p>

<b>CAPULET</b>
<p>Monday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon. Let it be on Thursday. On Thursday, tell her, she’ll be married to this noble earl. Will you be ready? Do you think it’s a good idea to rush? We shouldn’t have too big a celebration—we can invite a friend or two. Listen, because Tybalt was just killed, people might think that we don’t care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party. Therefore we’ll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding, and that’s it. What do you think about Thursday?</p>
