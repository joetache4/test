  - sp: PROSPERO
    o:
      - "Now my charms are all o’erthrown,"
      - "And what strength I have’s mine own,"
      - "Which is most faint. Now, ’tis true,"
      - "I must be here confined by you,"
      - "Or sent to Naples. Let me not,"
      - "Since I have my dukedom got"
      - "And pardoned the deceiver, dwell"
      - "In this bare island by your spell,"
      - "But release me from my bands"
      - "With the help of your good hands."
      - "Gentle breath of yours my sails"
      - "Must fill, or else my project fails,"
      - "Which was to please. Now I want"
      - "Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,"
      - "And my ending is despair,"
      - "Unless I be relieved by prayer,"
      - "Which pierces so that it assaults"
      - "Mercy itself and frees all faults."
      - "As you from crimes would pardoned be,"
      - "Let your indulgence set me free."
    m:
      - "Now my spells are all broken,"
      - "And the only power I have is my own,"
      - "Which is very weak. Now you all"
      - "Have got the power to keep me prisoner here,"
      - "Or send me off to Naples. Please don’t"
      - "Keep me here on this desert island"
      - "With your magic spells. Release me"
      - "So I can return to my dukedom"
      - "With your help. The gentle wind"
      - "You blow with your applause"
      - "Will fill my ship’s sails. Without applause,"
      - "My plan to please you has failed."
      - "Now I have no spirits to enslave,"
      - "No magic to cast spells,"
      - "And I’ll end up in despair"
      - "Unless I’m relieved by prayer,"
      - "Which wins over God himself"
      - "And absolves all sins."
      - "Just as you’d like to have your sins forgiven,"
      - "Indulge me, forgive me, and set me free."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."
