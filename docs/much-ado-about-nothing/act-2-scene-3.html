<p>I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another</p>
<p>man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love, will,</p>
<p>after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others,</p>
<p>become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love—</p>
<p>and such a man is Claudio. I have known when there was no</p>
<p>music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he</p>
<p>rather hear the tabor and the pipe. I have known when he</p>
<p>would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and</p>
<p>now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new</p>
<p>doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose,</p>
<p>like an honest man and a soldier, and now is he turned</p>
<p>orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just</p>
<p>so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with</p>
<p>these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not.</p>
<p>I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster,</p>
<p>but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me,</p>
<p>he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet</p>
<p>I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous,</p>
<p>yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one</p>
<p>woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s</p>
<p>certain; wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen</p>
<p>her; fair, or I’ll ever look on her; mild, or come not near</p>
<p>me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an</p>
<p>excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what color it</p>
<p>please God. Ha! The Prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide</p>
<p>me in the arbor.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<p>I’m amazed that a man, after watching romance turn another man into a fool and laughing at that man, can turn right around and become the thing he’s scorned. That’s the kind of man Claudio is. I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe. I knew him when he would’ve walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket. He used to speak plainly and to the point, like an honorable man and soldier; now his speech is elaborate and flowery. His words are like a miraculous banquet, full of strange new dishes. Will I be changed like that, and see the world through a lover’s eyes? I’m not sure, but I don’t think so. I can’t promise that love won’t transform me, but I can promise you this: until I truly fall in love, a woman will never make me act like such a fool. A beautiful woman comes along, but I’m unmoved. A wise woman turns up, but I’m unmoved. A virtuous woman appears, but I’m unmoved. I refuse to fall in love until all three qualities unite in a single woman. She must be rich, certainly, and smart, or I’ll have nothing to do with her. She has to be virtuous, or I’ll never bid on her; beautiful, or I won’t bother to look at her. Mild-mannered, or else she should stay away from me. Noble, or I won’t have her even if she’s an angel. She must be well spoken, an excellent musician, and her hair should be—well, I suppose the color doesn’t matter. Ha! Look, it’s the Prince and Mr. Love. I’ll hide in the arbor.</p>

<p><em>(coming forward)</em> This can be no trick. The conference was</p>

<p>bent. Love me? Why, it must be requited! I hear how I am</p>
<p>censured. They sy I will bear myself proudly if I perceive</p>
<p>the love come from her. They say, too, that she will rather</p>
<p>die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to</p>
<p>marry. I must not seem proud. Happy are they that hear</p>
<p>their detractions and can put them to mending. They say</p>
<p>the lady is fair; ’tis a truth, I can bear them witness. And</p>
<p>virtuous; ’tis so, I cannot reprove it. And wise, but for</p>
<p>loving me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no</p>
<p>great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love</p>
<p>with her! I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants</p>
<p>of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against</p>
<p>marriage, but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the</p>
<p>meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall</p>
<p>quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the</p>
<p>brain awe a man from the career of his humor?</p>
<p>No! The world must be peopled. When I said I would die a</p>
<p>bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married.</p>
<p>Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she’s a fair lady. I do spy</p>
<p>some marks of love in her.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>BENEDICK</b>
<p><em>(coming forward)</em> This can’t be a trick. They spoke with great seriousness, and they have Hero’s testimony. They seem to pity the lady. It seems her love is stretched to the limit. She loves me? Well, that love must be returned! I hear how I’m criticized. They say I’ll be smug if I find out she loves me. They also say she’d rather die than give any sign of her feelings. I never thought I’d marry. I can’t appear to be proud. People who discover their faults and can then change them are lucky indeed. They say the lady is beautiful; it’s true, I’ve seen it myself. And virtuous; that’s true, I can’t disprove that. And smart, except that she loves me. That may not be any proof of her intelligence, but I swear it won’t be evidence of her stupidity—for I’m going to be horribly in love with her! People might tease me here and there, since I attacked marriage for so long. But don’t tastes change? A man can love a dish when he is young that he hates when he turns old. Will quips and clever remarks and scathing written words keep a man from getting what his heart desires? No! The world needs to be populated. When I said that I’d die as a bachelor, I just meant that I didn’t think I’d live until I got married. Here comes Beatrice. By God! She’s a beautiful lady. I think I sense some signs of love in her.</p>
