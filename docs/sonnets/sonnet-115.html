<p>Those lines that I before have writ do lie,</p>
<p>Ev’n those that said I could not love you dearer.</p>
<p>Yet then my judgment knew no reason why</p>
<p>My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.</p>
<p>But reck’ning time, whose millioned accidents</p>
<p>Creep in ’twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,</p>
<p>Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp’st intents,</p>
<p>Divert strong minds to the course of alt’ring things.</p>
<p>Alas, why, fearing of time’s tyranny,</p>
<p>Might I not then say, “Now I love you best,”</p>
<p>When I was certain o’er incertainty,</p>
<p>Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?</p>
<p>Love is a babe; then might I not say so,</p>
<p>To give full growth to that which still doth grow?</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<p>I lied in those poems I wrote before where I said I couldn’t love you any more than I did already. Back then I had no reason to think that my love, which was already burning intensely, could burn any brighter. Instead, I was depending on the fact that the passage of time—together with the millions of unexpected events that can come between lovers’ promises and change even the decrees of kings—might darken a lover’s sacred beauty, take the edge off of a lover’s keenest intentions, and force the strongest minds to adapt to changing circumstances. Alas, why didn’t I say back then, when I was worried about time’s destructive power, “I love you best now”? I was so certain of my feelings despite the uncertainty, and I was ready to say my present happiness was complete, though I had doubts about everything to come. Love itself is a baby, so wouldn’t it have been natural for me to have said that my love for you was fully grown, though it keeps growing?</p>
