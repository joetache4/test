<p>Make room so he can stand in front of me. Shylock, everyone thinks—and I agree—that you’re just pretending to be cruel. They think that at the last second you’re going to show mercy and pity, which will be more surprising than the bizarre cruelty that you seem to be showing now. And even though you’re here to collect the penalty—a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh—they think you’ll not only let it go, but out of humanity and love you’ll forgive some portion of the principal he owes you too. In doing so you’ll be taking pity on him for his many recent losses, which have been large enough to send even the greatest merchant out of business, and make even the most hard-hearted Turk or Tartar feel sorry for him. What do you say? We all expect a nice answer from you, Jew.</p>

<p>I have possessed your grace of what I purpose,</p>

<p>To have the due and forfeit of my bond.</p>
<p>If you deny it, let the danger light</p>
<p>Upon your charter and your city’s freedom.</p>
<p>You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have</p>
<p>A weight of carrion flesh than to receive</p>
<p>Three thousand ducats. I’ll not answer that</p>
<p>But say it is my humour. Is it answered?</p>
<p>What if my house be troubled with a rat</p>
<p>And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats</p>
<p>To have it baned? What, are you answered yet?</p>
<p>Some men there are love not a gaping pig,</p>
<p>Some that are mad if they behold a cat,</p>
<p>And others, when the bagpipe sings i’ th’ nose,</p>
<p>Cannot contain their urine. For affection,</p>
<p>Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood</p>
<p>Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:</p>
<p>As there is no firm reason to be rendered</p>
<p>Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;</p>
<p>Why he, a harmless necessary cat;</p>
<p>Why he, a woollen bagpipe, but of force</p>
<p>Must yield to such inevitable shame</p>
<p>As to offend, himself being offended—</p>
<p>So can I give no reason, nor I will not</p>

<p>I bear Antonio), that I follow thus</p>
<p>A losing suit against him. Are you answered?</p>

<b>SHYLOCK</b>
<p>I’ve told you what I intend to do, and I’ve sworn by the holy Sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract. If you refuse to allow me to do so, your city’s charter and its freedom are endangered. You’re going to ask me why I’d rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats. I won’t answer that. Let’s just say it’s because I feel like it. Is that enough of an answer? What if I had a rat in my house, and I felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated? Do you have your answer yet? Some men don’t like roast pig, others go crazy if they see a cat, and others can’t help urinating when they hear bagpipes. There’s no sense trying to explain people’s likes and dislikes. So, to answer your question. Just as there’s no clear reason why one man doesn’t want a roast pig, or why another man can’t stand a harmless and useful cat, or another can’t tolerate bagpipes, so I can’t give a reason, and I won’t give a reason (other than the simple hate and loathing I feel for Antonio) why I’m pursuing this unprofitable case against him. Does that answer your question?</p>

<p><em>(to BASSANIO)</em> Please don’t bother arguing with the Jew. You might as well go stand on the beach and ask the ocean to get smaller.

You might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his Jewish heart. It’s the hardest thing imaginable. Therefore I’m begging you, don’t make any more offers, don’t look for other ways to stop him. Just let me receive my punishment, and let the Jew take his penalty.</p>

<p>Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I haven’t done anything wrong? Many of you own slaves, which—like your donkeys and dogs and mules—you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them. Should I say to you, “Set them free! Let them marry your children! Why are you making them work so hard? Let their beds be as soft as yours, and let them eat the same food as you”? No, you’d answer, “The slaves are ours.” And that’s just how I’m answering you. The pound of flesh that I want from him was very expensive. It’s mine and I’m going to get it. If you refuse me, the laws of Venice have no validity. I await justice. So answer me. Will I get it?</p>

<p>The quality of mercy is not strained.</p>
<p>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</p>
<p>Upon the place beneath. It is twice blessed:</p>
<p>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.</p>
<p>’Tis mightiest in the mightiest. It becomes</p>
<p>The thronèd monarch better than his crown.</p>
<p>His scepter shows the force of temporal power,</p>
<p>The attribute to awe and majesty</p>
<p>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings,</p>
<p>But mercy is above this sceptered sway.</p>
<p>It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings.</p>
<p>It is an attribute to God himself.</p>
<p>And earthly power doth then show likest God’s</p>
<p>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,</p>
<p>Though justice be thy plea, consider this—</p>
<p>That in the course of justice none of us</p>
<p>Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,</p>
<p>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render</p>
<p>The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much</p>
<p>To mitigate the justice of thy plea,</p>
<p>Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice</p>
<p>Must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant there.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>PORTIA</b>
<p>No one shows mercy because he has to. It just happens, the way gentle rain drops on the ground. Mercy is a double blessing. It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it. It’s strongest in the strongest people. It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him. The king’s scepter represents his earthly power, the symbol of majesty, the focus of royal authority. But mercy is higher than the scepter. It’s enthroned in the hearts of kings, a quality of God himself. Kingly power seems most like God’s power when the king mixes mercy with justice. So although justice is your plea, Jew, consider this. Justice won’t save our souls. We pray for mercy, and this same prayer teaches us to show mercy to others as well. I’ve told you this to make you give up this case. If you pursue it, this strict court of Venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there.</p>
