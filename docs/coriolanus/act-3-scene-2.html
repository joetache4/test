However, this doesn’t dishonor you any more than it would to capture a town with flattering words, a town that would otherwise take your fortune and spill your blood. I would feel it honorable to hide my real nature if my fortune and my friends were at risk. I speak for your wife, your son, these senators, and the nobles about this: you’d prefer to show the miserable commoners how you frown than flatter them in any way, even for the sake of their approval and to protect what might be ruined without it.</p>
