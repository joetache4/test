<b>RICHMOND</b>
<p>Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,</p>
<p>Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,</p>
<p>Have we marched on without impediment,</p>
<p>Thus far into the bowels of the land</p>
<p>And here receive we from our father Stanley</p>
<p>Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.</p>
<p>The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,</p>
<p>That spoiled your summer fields and fruitful vines,</p>
<p>Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough</p>
<p>In your embowelled bosoms—this foul swine</p>
<p>Is now even in the center of this isle,</p>
<p>Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn.</p>
<p>From Tamworth thither is but one day’s march.</p>
<p>In God’s name, cheerly on, courageous friends,</p>
<p>To reap the harvest of perpetual peace</p>
<p>By this one bloody trial of sharp war.</p>

<b>RICHMOND</b>
<p>Fellow soldiers and my loyal friends suffering under that tyrant Richard, we have marched all the way to the center of England without encountering any opposition. And now we receive encouraging news from my stepfather Stanley: Richard—that violent, greedy boar who roots through your summer fields and ripening vines, guzzles your warm blood, and makes his trough in your disemboweled bellies—is now near the town of Leicester, only one day’s march from us here in Tamworth. In God’s name, let’s continue on in high spirits, my courageous friends. Our aim is to achieve everlasting peace from this one violent war.</p>
