  - os: "Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, the dead body of Pacorus borne before him, with SILIUS, and other Romans, officers, and soldiers"
    ms: "The dead body of Pacorus is carried in, followed by the triumphant entrance of VENTIDIUS, with SILIUS and soldiers."

  - sp: VENTIDIUS
    o:
      - "Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now"
      - "Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus’ death"
      - "Make me revenger. Bear the King’s son’s body"
      - "Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,"
      - "Pays this for Marcus Crassus."
    m:
      - "Now I’ve paid you back, Parthia, and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus’ death. Carry King Orodes’ son at the front of our army, so all the Parthians will know—Orodes, Pacorus pays for Marcus Crassus!"

  - sp: SILIUS
    o:
      - "    Noble Ventidius,"
      - "Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,"
      - "The fugitive Parthians follow. Spur through Media,"
      - "Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither"
      - "The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,"
      - "Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and"
      - "Put garlands on thy head."
    m:
      - "Noble Ventidius, while your sword is still warm with the blood of slain Parthians, why not finish the job? The Parthians retreat. Go after them. Chase them down if you have to track them through Media, Mesopotamia, or any other places they may go to hide. Then our great general, Antony, will commend you."

  - sp: VENTIDIUS
    o:
      - "    O Silius, Silius,"
      - "I have done enough. A lower place, note well,"
      - "May make too great an act. For learn this, Silius:"
      - "Better to leave undone than by our deed"
      - "Acquire too high a fame when him we serve’s away."
      - "Caesar and Antony have ever won"
      - "More in their officer than person. Sossius,"
      - "One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,"
      - "For quick accumulation of renown,"
      - "Which he achieved by th’ minute, lost his favor."
      - "Who does i’ th’ wars more than his captain can"
      - "Becomes his captain’s captain; and ambition,"
      - "The soldier’s virtue, rather makes choice of loss"
      - "Than gain which darkens him."
      - "I could do more to do Antonius good,"
      - "But ’twould offend him, and in his offense"
      - "Should my performance perish."
    m:
      - "Oh, Silius, Silius, I’ve done enough. A subordinate may exceed his authority. You must understand, Silius, that it’s better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior’s absence. Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person. Sossius, an officer that held the same position in Syria as I do here, achieved great distinction very quickly but lost Antony’s support as a result. A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain’s rival. Ambition is a good quality in a soldier, but it proves detrimental rather than beneficial when used to surpass his superiors. I could do more to help Antony, but to do so would insult him. And by insulting him, I would lose credit for the good I have done him already."

  - sp: SILIUS
    o:
      - "Thou hast, Ventidius, that"
      - "Without the which a soldier and his sword"
      - "Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?"
    m:
      - "A soldier is just a tool, like his sword, unless he has your qualities, Ventidius. Are you going to write Antony about this?"

  - sp: VENTIDIUS
    o:
      - "I’ll humbly signify what in his name,"
      - "That magical word of war, we have effected:"
      - "How with his banners and his well-paid ranks"
      - "The ne’er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia"
      - "We have jaded out o’ th’ field."
    m:
      - "I’ll modestly tell him what I have done in his name—that’s the magical wording these days. I’ll write how, under his flag and with his well-paid troops, we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia."

  - sp: SILIUS
    o:
      - "    Where is he now?"
    m:
      - "Where’s Antony now?"

  - sp: VENTIDIUS
    o:
      - "He purposeth to Athens, whither, with what haste"
      - "The weight we must convey with’s will permit,"
      - "We shall appear before him. *(to the soliders)* On, there. Pass along!"
    m:
      - "He plans to go to Athens. We must arrive there before him, as quickly as our baggage train will allow us. *(to the soldiers)* Get a move on!"

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They all exit."
