  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ’rayed? Was ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they are coming after to warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself. For, considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold.—Holla, ho! Curtis!"
    m:
      - "To hell with all worn-out horses, all crazy masters, and all bad roads. Was a man ever beaten as much as me? Was a man ever as dirty as me? Was a man ever so tired? I have been sent on ahead to light a fire, and they are coming after to warm themselves. It’s a good thing I’m like a little pot and warm up quickly, or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, and my heart would freeze in my belly, before I managed to get thawed out. I’ll warm myself by blowing on the fire. A taller man than I would catch cold in weather like this. Hey! Curtis! Hello!"

  - os: "Enter CURTIS"
    ms: "CURTIS enters."

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "Who is that calls so coldly?"
    m:
      - "Who calls so coldly?"

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck. A fire, good Curtis."
    m:
      - "A piece of ice. Trust me, you could slide all the way from my shoulder to my heel taking no more of a running start than the distance between my head and my neck. Start the fire, good Curtis."

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?"
    m:
      - "Are my master and his wife coming, Grumio?"

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Oh, ay, Curtis, ay, and therefore fire, fire. Cast on no water."
    m:
      - "Yes, yes, Curtis, so hurry up and start the fire. Leave out the water."

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "Is she so hot a shrew as she’s reported?"
    m:
      - "Is she as fiery a shrew as they say?"

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "She was, good Curtis, before this frost. But thou knowest winter tames man, woman and beast, for it hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and myself, fellow Curtis."
    m:
      - "Well she was, good Curtis, before this frost. But you know how winter tames man, woman, and beast. And it’s tamed my old master and my new mistress and myself, my good colleague."

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast."
    m:
      - "Who are you calling “beast,” midget. You’re no bigger than three inches!"

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long am I, at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress, whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?"
    m:
      - "Three inches? Really? Your horn is a foot long, and I’m at least that size. Now are you going to make a fire, or am I going to have to report you to our mistress, whose hand, now that she is herself at hand, you’ll be feeling soon. You’ll find it cold comfort, but that’s what you get for being slow with your warming duties."

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?"
    m:
      - "So tell me, Grumio, how goes the world?"

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine, and therefore fire! Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death."
    m:
      - "Cold, Curtis. It’s a cold world, except for people who have to start fires. Therefore, do your duty and take your reward, because my master and mistress are nearly frozen to death."

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "There’s fire ready. And therefore, good Grumio, the news."
    m:
      - "The fire is ready. So go on, tell me the news."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Why, “Jack, boy! Ho, boy!” and as much news as wilt thou."
    m:
      - "“Why, Jack boy, ho boy!” and all the news you want."

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "Come, you are so full of cony-catching!"
    m:
      - "Oh, you’re just *so* funny."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Why, therefore fire, for I have caught extreme cold. Where’s the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the servingmen in their new fustian, their white stockings, and every officer his wedding garment on? Be the Jacks fair within, the Jills fair without, the carpets laid, and everything in order?"
    m:
      - "Well, make a fire, then. I think I’m getting delirious. Where’s the cook? Is supper ready? Is the house fixed up, the floor covered, the cobwebs swept out of the corners, the servingmen in their new work clothes and the household servants each in his wedding suit? Are all the cups and glasses in their places, the tablecloths laid out—everything in order?"

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "All ready. And therefore, I pray thee, news."
    m:
      - "Everything’s ready. So tell me what’s been going on."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "First, know my horse is tired, my master and mistress fallen out."
    m:
      - "Well, first of all, my horse is tired and my master and mistress have had a falling out."

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "How?"
    m:
      - "How?"

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Out of their saddles into the dirt, and thereby hangs a tale."
    m:
      - "From their saddles into the dirt—but that’s another story."

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "Let’s ha’ ’t, good Grumio."
    m:
      - "Well, let’s have it, Grumio."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Lend thine ear."
    m:
      - "Lean forward."

  - sp: CURTIS

  - os: "Strikes him"
    ms: "GRUMIO strikes CURTIS."

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "This ’tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale."
    m:
      - "This is to feel the news, not hear it."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "And therefore ’tis called a sensible tale. And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list’ning. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress—"
    m:
      - "That’s what makes it “sensitive” news. I was just knocking to see if anyone was home. Now, I’ll begin: first, we came down a steep hill, my master riding behind my mistress—"

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "Both of one horse?"
    m:
      - "Both on one horse?"

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "What’s that to thee?"
    m:
      - "What’s the difference?"

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "Why, a horse."
    m:
      - "Well, the difference of a horse!"

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Tell thou the tale! But hadst thou not crossed me, thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell, and she under her horse. Thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me because her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed that never prayed before, how I cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienced to thy grave."
    m:
      - "Oh, tell it yourself if you’re so smart. It’s too bad. If you hadn’t made me angry, you would have heard all about how her horse fell with her under it, how swampy the place was, too, and how she was covered in mud, and how he left her like that, with the horse on top of her, and how he beat *me* because *her* horse stumbled, and how she waded through the dirt to pull him off me, and how he swore, how she prayed—this woman who never prayed before—and how I yelled, and how the horses ran away, and how her bridle broke, and how I lost my riding crop, and many other things worth telling, which now will all be lost to memory, and you’ll go to your grave ignorant."

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "By this reck’ning he is more shrew than she."
    m:
      - "By the sound of it, he’s a bigger shrew than she is."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest. Let their heads be slickly combed, their blue coats brushed, and their garters of an indifferent knit. Let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?"
    m:
      - "Yes—as you and the rest will find out as soon as he’s home. But why am I telling you this? Get them in here—Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest. Tell them to slick down their hair, brush their blue coats, and make sure their socks match. Have them click their heels together and don’t dare touch a hair of the master’s horse’s tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?"

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "They are."
    m:
      - "They are."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:

    m:
      - "*(calling offstage)* Hey! Does anyone hear me? Hey! You have to come and greet the master and face the new mistress."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Why, she hath a face of her own."
    m:
      - "She already has a face."

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "Who knows not that?"
    m:
      - "Yeah, so?"

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:

    m:
      - "You just said they had to face her."

  - sp: CURTIS
    o:
      - "I call them forth to credit her."
    m:
      - "I meant they had to give her credit."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:

    m:
      - "Nathaniel’s coat was being fixed, sir. And one of Gabriel’s shoes had a broken heel. And Peter couldn’t find a matching hat. And Walter couldn’t get his dagger out of its sheath. Only Adam, Rafe, and Gregory were ready. The rest were just a mess—but such as they are, sir, they’re here to welcome you."

      - "the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey. She had no food today and will have none. Last night she got no sleep, and she won’t get any tonight. Just as I did with the meat, I’ll make up some problem with the way the bed is made, and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other, and the blanket over here and the sheets over there. And through all the shouting and fuss, I’ll swear that it’s all out of love for her. The end result will be that she’ll sit up all night. And if she starts to drop off, I’ll rant and yell until I wake her up. This is how to kill a wife with kindness. And this way I’ll cure her wild and willful nature. If anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew, speak up, please. It would be much appreciated."
