A man like you—faint, lifeless, dull, deadly-looking, sad—woke King Priam in the dead of night to tell him that half the city of Troy had been burned down. But Priam saw the fire before this man could speak, and I can see my Percy’s death before you report it. You’re going to tell me, “Your son did such-and-such; your brother did this; the noble Douglas fought like so.” You’ll stuff my greedy ears with stories of their bold deeds.

<p>I am sorry I should force you to believe</p>
<p>That which I would to God I had not seen,</p>
<p>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</p>
<p>Rend’ring faint quittance, wearied and outbreathed,</p>
<p>To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down</p>
<p>The never-daunted Percy to the earth,</p>
<p>From whence with life he never more sprung up.</p>
<p>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire</p>
<p>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,</p>
<p>Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</p>
<p>From the best tempered courage in his troops;</p>
<p>For from his metal was his party steeled,</p>
<p>Which, once in him abated, all the rest</p>
<p>Turned on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.</p>
<p>And as the thing that’s heavy in itself</p>
<p>Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,</p>
<p>So did our men, heavy in Hotspur’s loss,</p>
<p>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</p>
<p>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</p>
<p>Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</p>
<p>Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester</p>
<p>Too soon ta’en prisoner; and that furious Scot,</p>
<p>The bloody Douglas, whose well-laboring sword</p>
<p>Had three times slain th’appearance of the King,</p>
<p>Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame</p>
<p>Of those that turned their backs and in his flight,</p>
<p>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</p>
<p>Is that the King hath won and hath sent out</p>
<p>A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,</p>
<p>Under the conduct of young Lancaster</p>
<p>And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>MORTON</b>
<p>I’m sorry that I must force you to believe this, when I wish to God that I hadn’t seen it myself. But I saw him, in his bloody state, with my own eyes. He was barely able to fight back, exhausted and out of breath. Harry Monmouth’s swift fury beat the unflinching Percy down to the ground, and once he was there, Percy never rose again. To be brief, Percy’s spirit inspired the entire army, down to the dullest peasant. When the news got out that he had been killed, it took the fire and courage away from even the bravest soldiers. Percy’s metal steeled the whole army; when they learned that he had been blunted, they bent and warped like dull, heavy lead. And just as a heavy object gains momentum once it’s pushed into motion, our army, made heavy by Hotspur’s death, suddenly started moving fast—faster than arrows flying toward a target—but they flew toward safety, not toward the battle. Soon, Worcester, that furious Scotsman, was captured. The warlike Douglas, who killed three enemies disguised as King Henry, began to lose courage: he ran away as well, lending his authority to the shameful retreat. But running in fear, he stumbled and was captured. The bottom line is that King Henry has won. He’s sent a speedy force after you, sir, led by young John of Lancaster and Westmoreland. That is the whole story.</p>

<p>There will be time to mourn for this. Sometimes poison can be a kind of medicine: this news, which would have made me sick had I been well, has, because I am sick, made me well. A dying man—his joints weakened by fever, dangling like useless hinges and crumpling under the man’s own weight—will sometimes be stuck with a fit of impatience, causing him to burst out of his caretaker’s arms. My limbs are like that now; once weakened by grief, they’re now enraged by grief, and are three times as powerful as they were before. Away from me, you unmanly crutch! Chain mail armor will cover my hands now. Away from me, you invalid’s cap! You are too fanciful a helmet for this head which is now the target of kings, grown arrogant with their victories. Wrap my head in iron, and then attack me with the roughest things that destiny and hatred will dare to bring upon me in my rage. Let the sky come crashing down! Let the ocean overflow the shores! Let law and order die! And let the world no longer be a stage for a long, drawn-out struggle: let the spirit of Cain, who committed the first murder against his brother Abel, live in every heart. If every heart is a murderer’s heart, this violent play will end, and darkness will shroud the corpses.</p>

<p>Gentle Earl, don’t abandon your wisdom. All your allies are depending on you and your well-being. If you allow yourself to indulge in this kind of stormy emotion, your health will deteriorate even further. Before you said, “Let’s raise an army,” you calculated how the war might end, and you thought carefully about the likeliness of a victory. You knew from the beginning that, once the fighting started, your son might die. You knew that he was treading dangerously, as if on the edge of a precipice: you knew he was more likely to fall over than make it across. You were warned that your son was made of flesh and blood, and that it was possible he’d get hurt. You were warned that his temper and hot-headedness would push him into the most dangerous situations. But you still said, “Go forward.” None of this consideration, even though it was clearly understood, could stop the stubborn course of events. So what happened here? What has been the result of this brave undertaking? Only this: precisely what was likely to happen in the first place.</p>

<b>LORD BARDOLPH</b>
<p>We all knew that we were venturing into dangerous waters. We knew the odds were ten to one that we would come out alive, and yet we ventured forward anyway. The potential reward of winning outweighed the fear of our probable loss. We lost this time, but let’s try again. Come, we’ll all go for it, body and soul.</p>

<p>’Tis more than time.—And, my most noble lord,</p>
<p>I hear for certain, and do speak the truth:</p>
<p>The gentle Archbishop of York is up</p>
<p>With well-appointed powers. He is a man</p>
<p>Who with a double surety binds his followers.</p>
<p>My lord your son had only but the corpse,</p>
<p>But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;</p>
<p>For that same word “rebellion” did divide</p>
<p>The action of their bodies from their souls,</p>
<p>And they did fight with queasiness, constrained,</p>
<p>As men drink potions, that their weapons only</p>
<p>Seemed on our side. But, for their spirits and souls,</p>
<p>This word “rebellion,” it had froze them up</p>
<p>As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop</p>
<p>Turns insurrection to religion.</p>
<p>Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,</p>
<p>He’s followed both with body and with mind,</p>
<p>And doth enlarge his rising with the blood</p>
<p>Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;</p>
<p>Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;</p>
<p>Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,</p>
<p>Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;</p>
<p>And more and less do flock to follow him.</p>

<p>It is the appropriate time. Good sir, I hear for certain, and I tell you truthfully, that the Archbishop of York has raised a powerful army. He motivates his men with both his earthly and his spiritual powers. My lord, your son commanded only his soldiers’ bodies. The word “rebellion” frightened them, separating their bodies from their hearts. It caused them to fight timidly, hesitantly, as though they were taking medicine: their weapons seemed to be on our side, but their spirits and souls were frozen, like fish in an icy pond. But now, the Archbishop turns our rebellion into a religious cause. Everyone believes he’s a righteous and holy man, and they follow him not only in body but also in mind. He enhances his cause by preaching about the blood of good King Richard, which was spilled at Pomfret Castle. The Archbishop claims that he derives his authority from heaven; tells the men that the whole country is bleeding, gasping for life under the terrible leadership of Bolingbroke. And so men from every walk of life flock like sheep to follow him.</p>

<p>I knew of this before, but, to speak truth,</p>
<p>This present grief had wiped it from my mind.</p>
<p>Go in with me and counsel every man</p>
<p>The aptest way for safety and revenge.</p>
<p>Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed.</p>
<p>Never so few, and never yet more need.</p>

<p>I knew all this, but to tell you the truth, this terrible grief had pushed it out of my thoughts. Come inside; I want to hear everyone’s ideas on the best way to defend ourselves and enact our revenge. Send out messengers and letters, and make new allies quickly. Our numbers have never been smaller, but there’s never been more need for what we have to do.</p>
