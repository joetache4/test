      - "Thy bosom is endearèd with all hearts"
      - "Which I, by lacking, have supposèd dead;"
      - "And there reigns love, and all love’s loving parts,"
      - "And all those friends which I thought burièd."
      - "How many a holy and obsequious tear"
      - "Hath dear religious love stol’n from mine eye"
      - "As interest of the dead, which now appear"
      - "But things removed that hidden in thee lie."
      - "Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,"
      - "Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,"
      - "Who all their parts of me to thee did give;"
      - "That due of many now is thine alone."
      - "  Their images I loved I view in thee,"
      - "  And thou, all they, hast all the all of me."

      - "You have the love of everyone who used to love me, people who I supposed were dead because I didn’t have their love anymore. Love reigns in your heart—both everything belonging to love and all those friends who I thought were dead and buried. How many tears of devoted love have I shed at funerals, in payment to the dead, when now it appears they had only gone to hide in your heart. You’re like a grave where dead lovers come alive again, decorated with mementos of those lost loves who gave you all the love I owed to each of them. All the love I owed to many is now yours alone. I see these lovers in you, and you, who contain everyone I have ever loved or was loved by, have all of me."
