<p>He wondered that your lordship</p>
<p>Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,</p>

<p>Put forth their sons to seek preferment out,</p>
<p>Some to the wars, to try their fortune there,</p>
<p>Some to discover islands far away,</p>
<p>Some to the studious universities.</p>
<p>For any or for all these exercises</p>
<p>He said that Proteus your son was meet,</p>
<p>And did request me to importune you</p>
<p>To let him spend his time no more at home,</p>
<p>Which would be great impeachment to his age</p>
<p>In having known no travel in his youth.</p>
</td>

<b>PANTHINO</b>
<p>He wondered why your lordship would let him spend his youth here at home. Other men with lesser reputations send their sons to seek opportunities abroad, or to find their fortunes fighting in the wars, or to discover far away islands, or to study in the universities. He said that Proteus was capable of doing any or all of these things, and he asked me to urge you not to let him spend any more time at home. It would be a shame for him in old age not to have traveled in his youth.</p>

<p>Nor need’st thou much importune me to that</p>
<p>Whereon this month I have been hammering.</p>
<p>I have considered well his loss of time,</p>
<p>And how he cannot be a perfect man,</p>
<p>Not being tried and tutored in the world.</p>
<p>Experience is by industry achieved</p>
<p>And perfected by the swift course of time.</p>
<p>Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ANTONIO</b>
<p>You don’t need to urge me on this matter. I’ve thought about it a lot this month. I’ve considered how much time he’s wasting, and how he cannot be a complete man without having some real-world trials and tests. Experience comes from hard work and is perfected over the course of time. Tell me, though, where would it be best to send him?</p>

<p>O, how this spring of love resembleth</p>

<p>I dove into the sea to avoid being burned by the fire, and now I’m drowning instead. I was afraid to show Julia’s letter to my father because I didn’t want him to disapprove of my love, but taking advantage of my lie he raised more obstacles against it. Oh, our new love is like the uncertain days of April, which will be sunny one moment, and suddenly a cloud takes the sunshine away!</p>
