  - os: "Alarum as in battle. Enter, from opposite sides, MARTIUS and AUFIDIUS"
    ms: "A trumpet sounds from the battle. MARTIUS and AUFIDIUS enter from opposite sides."

  - sp: MARTIUS
    o:
      - "I’ll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee"
      - "Worse than a promise-breaker."
    m:
      - "I’ll fight only against you, because I hate you worse than a traitor."

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "We hate alike:"
      - "Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor"
      - "More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot."
    m:
      - "We feel the same hatred. There’s not a snake in Africa that I hate more than your fame and envy. Prepare to fight."

  - sp: MARTIUS
    o:
      - "Let the first budger die the other’s slave,"
      - "And the gods doom him after!"
    m:
      - "Whoever runs away from this fight first must become the other’s slave until death, and after that may the gods curse him!"

      - "If I fly, Martius,"

    o:
      - "Within these three hours, Tullus,"
      - "Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,"
      - "And made what work I pleased: ’tis not my blood"
      - "Wherein thou seest me mask’d; for thy revenge"
      - "Wrench up thy power to the highest."
    m:
      - "Less than three hours ago, Tullus, I fought alone inside the walls of Corioles, and I killed whoever I wanted. It’s not my own blood you see me covered in. For your revenge, fight me with your fullest force."

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "Wert thou the Hector"
      - "That was the whip of your bragg’d progeny,"
      - "Thou shouldst not scape me here."
    m:
      - "If you’re anything like Hector, the failed champion of your ancestors whom you’re so proud of, you won’t escape me here."

  - os: "They fight, and certain Volsces come to the aid of AUFIDIUS. MARTIUS fights till they be driven in breathless"
    ms: "They fight, and some Volsces come to the aid of AUFIDIUS. MARTIUS fights until they’re out of breath."

  - o:
      - "Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me"
      - "In your condemned seconds."
    m:
      - "You’re intrusive, not brave. You’ve shamed me with your assistance, and I condemn you for it."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "All exit."
