    ms: "Trumpets sound. CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the noblemen, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators enter."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?"
    m:
      - "Tullus Aufidius had assembled a new army?"

  - sp: LARTIUS
    o:
      - "He had, my lord; and that it was which caused"
      - "Our swifter composition."
    m:
      - "He had, my lord, and that was why we needed to reach an agreement sooner than expected."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "So then the Volsces stand but as at first,"
      - "Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road."
      - "Upon’s again."
    m:
      - "So then, the Volsces will be able to attack us again when the time is right."

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:
      - "They are worn, lord consul, so,"
      - "That we shall hardly in our ages see"
      - "Their banners wave again."
    m:
      - "They’re worn out, lord consul, so we won’t likely see their banners wave again in our lifetime."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Saw you Aufidius?"
    m:
      - "Did you see Aufidius?"

  - sp: LARTIUS
    o:
      - "On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse"
      - "Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely"
      - "Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium."
    m:
      - "He came to me, under high security, and cursed the Volsces because they had failed so miserably by letting the town be captured. He has retreated to Antium."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Spoke he of me?"

  - sp: LARTIUS
    o:

      - "He did, my lord."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "How? what?"
    m:
      - "What did he say?"

  - sp: LARTIUS
    o:
      - "How often he had met you, sword to sword;"
      - "That of all things upon the earth he hated"
      - "Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes"
      - "To hopeless restitution, so he might"
      - "Be call’d your vanquisher."
    m:
      - "He spoke of how often you and he had met in battle. He said that of all things on earth, he hated you the most and that he would pawn his fortunes until he was hopelessly broke in order to defeat you."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "At Antium lives he?"
    m:
      - "He’s living in Antium?"

  - sp: LARTIUS
    o:

    m:
      - "In Antium."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "I wish I had a cause to seek him there,"
      - "To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home."
    m:
      - "I wish I had a reason to go there and show him how much I hate him, too. Welcome home."

  - os: "Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS"
    ms: "SICINIUS and BRUTUS enter."

  - o:
      - "Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,"
      - "The tongues o’ the common mouth: I do despise them;"
      - "For they do prank them in authority,"
      - "Against all noble sufferance."
    m:
      - "Look, here are the tribunes. I hate them because their authority is an insult to the power of the nobility."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Pass no further."
    m:
      - "Go no further."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Ha! what is that?"
    m:
      - "Ha! What did you say?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "It will be dangerous to go on: no further."
    m:
      - "It will be dangerous for you to go any further."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "What makes this change?"
    m:
      - "What’s changed?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "The matter?"
    m:
      - "What’s the matter?"

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:
      - "Hath he not pass’d the noble and the common?"
    m:
      - "Hasn’t he been approved by the nobility and the common people?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Cominius, no."
    m:
      - "No, Cominius."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Have I had children’s voices?"
    m:
      - "Have they broken their promise like children?"

  - sp: FIRST SENATOR
    o:
      - "Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place."
    m:
      - "Tribunes, let us through. He’s going to the marketplace."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "The people are incensed against him."
    m:
      - "The people are furious with him."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Stop,"
      - "Or all will fall in broil."
    m:
      - "Stop, or a riot will break out."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Are these your herd?"
      - "Must these have voices, that can yield them now"
      - "And straight disclaim their tongues? What are"
      - "your offices?"
      - "You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?"
      - "Have you not set them on?"
    m:
      - "Is this your herd? Why do these people have the right to vote, if they can vote one way and then immediately change their mind? What’s your job? If you control what they think and say, can’t you control what they do? Have you incited them against us?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Be calm, be calm."
    m:
      - "Be calm, be calm."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,"
      - "To curb the will of the nobility:"
      - "Suffer’t, and live with such as cannot rule"
      - "Nor ever will be ruled."
    m:
      - "It’s a deliberate plot to undercut the authority of the nobility. If we succumb to it, we’ll have to live alongside these uncontrollable people who themselves are incapable of governing."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Call’t not a plot:"
      - "The people cry you mock’d them, and of late,"
      - "When corn was given them gratis, you repined;"
      - "Scandal’d the suppliants for the people, call’d them"
      - "Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness."
    m:
      - "Don’t call it a plot. The people say you mocked them, and recently when corn was given to them for free, you complained and slandered us, the representatives of the people, calling us opportunists, flatterers, and enemies to nobility."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Why, this was known before."
    m:
      - "You were already known as such."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Not to them all."
    m:
      - "Not all of them thought so."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Have you inform’d them sithence?"
    m:
      - "Have you informed them since?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "How! I inform them!"
    m:
      - "How would I inform them?"

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "You are like to do such business."
    m:
      - "By the way you do business."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Not unlike,"
      - "Each way, to better yours."
    m:
      - "Possibly, but whatever I do, I do it better than you would do as consul."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,"
      - "Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me"
      - "Your fellow tribune."
    m:
      - "Why then should I be consul? If I am as bad as you, make me your fellow tribune."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "You show too much of that"
      - "For which the people stir: if you will pass"
      - "To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,"
      - "Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,"
      - "Or never be so noble as a consul,"
      - "Nor yoke with him for tribune."
    m:
      - "You cause too much disturbance among the people. If you want to get where you want to go, you must ask kindly to get there. You’re a long way off from doing that. And without doing so, you’ll never be noble enough to be consul or even be his equal as a tribune."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Let’s be calm."
    m:
      - "Let’s stay calm."

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:
      - "The people are abused; set on. This paltering"
      - "Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus"
      - "Deserved this so dishonour’d rub, laid falsely"
      - "I’ the plain way of his merit."
    m:
      - "The people have been deceived and now incited. Trickery like this is not how Romans behave. Coriolanus shouldn’t be dishonored by these false accusations because his bravery makes him so clearly deserving."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Tell me of corn!"
      - "This was my speech, and I will speak’t again—"
    m:
      - "Talk to me about corn! This was my speech, and I will speak it again—"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Not now, not now."
    m:
      - "Not now, not now."

  - sp: FIRST SENATOR
    o:
      - "Not in this heat, sir, now."
    m:
      - "Not when the people are so agitated, sir, not now."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,"
      - "I crave their pardons:"
      - "For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them"
      - "Regard me as I do not flatter, and"
      - "Therein behold themselves: I say again,"
      - "In soothing them, we nourish ’gainst our senate"
      - "The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,"
      - "Which we ourselves have plough’d for, sow’d,"
      - "and scatter’d,"
      - "By mingling them with us, the honour’d number,"
      - "Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that"
      - "Which they have given to beggars."
    m:
      - "As sure as I’m alive, I will speak now. My nobler friends, I beg your pardon. As for the two-faced, stinking masses, let them see themselves clearly because I will not flatter them. I say again, by flattering them, we encourage the seeds of rebellion, disobedience, treason against our Senate—seeds that we ourselves have plowed for, sowed, and scattered by mingling them with us, the honorable ones. The only virtue or power that we lack is that which we have given to these beggars."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Well, no more."
    m:
      - "That’s enough, no more."

  - sp: FIRST SENATOR
    o:
      - "No more words, we beseech you."
    m:
      - "No more words, we beg you."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "How! no more!"
      - "As for my country I have shed my blood,"
      - "Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs"
      - "Coin words till their decay against those measles,"
      - "Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought"
      - "The very way to catch them."
    m:
      - "What? No more? I have shed my blood for my country without fearing opposing forces, so my lungs will speak until the hated measles—that we caught by trying to help the people—cause us to become infected and die."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "You speak o’ the people,"
      - "As if you were a god to punish, not"
      - "A man of their infirmity."
    m:
      - "You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish them, not a mortal man just like them."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "’Twere well"
      - "We let the people know’t."
    m:
      - "It would be a good idea for us to let the people know this."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "What, what? his choler?"
    m:
      - "Know what? About his anger?"

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Choler!"
      - "Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,"
      - "By Jove, ’twould be my mind!"
    m:
      - "Anger! If I were as calm as in midnight sleep, by Jove, this would still be my opinion!"

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "It is a mind"
      - "That shall remain a poison where it is,"
      - "Not poison any further."
    m:
      - "It’s a poisonous opinion that shall remain where it is and not poison any further."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Shall remain!"
      - "Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you"
      - "His absolute “shall”?"
    m:
      - "“Shall remain”? Do you hear this, Triton of the minnows? Do you hear his absolute “shall”?"

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:
      - "’Twas from the canon."
    m:
      - "It was inappropriate."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "“Shall”!"
      - "O good but most unwise patricians! why,"
      - "You grave but reckless senators, have you thus"
      - "Given Hydra here to choose an officer,"
      - "That with his peremptory “shall,” being but"
      - "The horn and noise o’ the monster’s, wants not spirit"
      - "To say he’ll turn your current in a ditch,"
      - "And make your channel his? If he have power"
      - "Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake"
      - "Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn’d,"
      - "Be not as common fools; if you are not,"
      - "Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,"
      - "If they be senators: and they are no less,"
      - "When, both your voices blended, the great’st taste"
      - "Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,"
      - "And such a one as he, who puts his “shall,”"
      - "His popular “shall” against a graver bench"
      - "Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!"
      - "It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches"
      - "To know, when two authorities are up,"
      - "Neither supreme, how soon confusion"
      - "May enter ’twixt the gap of both and take"
      - "The one by the other."
    m:
      - "“Shall”! Oh, good but most unwise nobleman! You dignified but reckless senators, why have you permitted this many-headed monster to choose a representative whose arrogant “shall” is just the monster’s noisy horn and who has the nerve to say he’ll take advantage of your power and use your resources for his own purposes? If he’s in power, then it’s your mistake that has you bowing to him. If not, then wake up from your dangerous tolerance of him.  If you’re good leaders, don’t be common fools. If you’re not, let them have seats with you in the Senate. If they were senators, that would make you into commoners. And if you had equal say, the interests of the common people would outweigh yours. The people chose as their representative someone who addresses his “shall,” his common man’s command of “shall” to the most dignified legislature since the Greeks. By Jove himself! It lowers the position of the consuls and my soul aches to know, when there are two authorities and neither is supreme, how quickly chaos will arise in the space between them and use one to overthrow the other."

  - sp: COMINIUS
    o:
      - "Well, on to the market-place."
    m:
      - "Let’s go on to the marketplace."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth"
      - "The corn o’ the storehouse gratis, as ’twas used"
      - "Sometime in Greece,—"
    m:
      - "Whoever gave the advice to give out corn from the storehouse for free, as they used to do in Greece—"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Well, well, no more of that."
    m:
      - "That’s enough. No more talk of that."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Though there the people had more absolute power,"
      - "I say, they nourish’d disobedience, fed"
      - "The ruin of the state."
    m:
      - "Even though the people had more absolute power in Greece, I think whoever gave that advice invited disobedience and caused the ruin of the state."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Why, shall the people give"
      - "One that speaks thus their voice?"
    m:
      - "Should the people give up someone who speaks for them?"

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "I’ll give my reasons,"
      - "More worthier than their voices. They know the corn"
      - "Was not our recompense, resting well assured"
      - "That ne’er did service for’t: being press’d to the war,"
      - "Even when the navel of the state was touch’d,"
      - "They would not thread the gates. This kind of service"
      - "Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i’ the war"
      - "Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show’d"
      - "Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation"
      - "Which they have often made against the senate,"
      - "All cause unborn, could never be the motive"
      - "Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?"
      - "How shall this bisson multitude digest"
      - "The senate’s courtesy? Let deeds express"
      - "What’s like to be their words: “we did request it;"
      - "We are the greater poll, and in true fear"
      - "They gave us our demands.” Thus we debase"
      - "The nature of our seats and make the rabble"
      - "Call our cares fears; which will in time"
      - "Break ope the locks o’ the senate and bring in"
      - "The crows to peck the eagles."
    m:
      - "I’ll give my reasons, which are worthier than their wishes. They know they didn’t earn the corn, as they certainly never did any service for it. Even when they were drafted to fight the war when the center of the state was threatened, they wouldn’t leave the city gates. This kind of service doesn’t deserve free corn. When they were in the war, their mutinies and revolts, which were the only times they showed any courage, didn’t speak well for them. Their frequent accusation that the Senate was hoarding corn had no basis, so it could never be the reason for our generous gift. Well, what then? How will this many-headed monster repay the Senate’s kindness? Let their actions express what their words should be: “We asked for it, we are the majority of the population, and out of fear they gave in to our demands.” In doing this we degrade the nature of our position and make the rabble think that our sympathy is fear. In time this will break open the locks of the Senate, and the scavengers will devour us."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Come, enough."
    m:
      - "Okay, that’s enough."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Enough, with over-measure."
    m:
      - "Enough overstatement."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "No, take more:"
      - "What may be sworn by, both divine and human,"
      - "Seal what I end withal! This double worship,"
      - "Where one part does disdain with cause, the other"
      - "Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,"
      - "Cannot conclude but by the yea and no"
      - "Of general ignorance,—it must omit"
      - "Real necessities, and give way the while"
      - "To unstable slightne purpose so barr’d,"
      - "it follows,"
      - "Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,—"
      - "You that will be less fearful than discreet,"
      - "That love the fundamental part of state"
      - "More than you doubt the change on’t, that prefer"
      - "A noble life before a long, and wish"
      - "To jump a body with a dangerous physic"
      - "That’s sure of death without it, at once pluck out"
      - "The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick"
      - "The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour"
      - "Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state"
      - "Of that integrity which should become’t,"
      - "Not having the power to do the good it would,"
      - "For the in which doth control’t."
    m:
      - "No, there’s more! I swear there’s both divine and human confirmation of what I have to say. A divided government—in which one part rightfully despises the other and the other part makes insulting accusations without any reason, and in which people of class, title, and wisdom are reduced to deciding things just by voting yes or no—will be unable to focus on important matters and so instead will deal only with trivial concerns. When governing becomes so difficult, it makes sense that nothing will get done well. So I beg you, you who won’t be afraid to take action because you care more about preserving our government than you fear the consequences of doing so, you who prefer a noble life over a long one and are willing to use a dangerous medicine to help someone who would otherwise surely die, you must immediately remove the representatives of the common people. Don’t let the tribunes use their poisonous flattery. When they dishonor you, it’s an impediment to justice. It robs the state of your much-needed integrity and leaves the state without the power to do the good it would because evil forces are controlling it."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Has said enough."
    m:
      - "He has said enough."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer"
      - "As traitors do."
    m:
      - "He has spoken like a traitor and must be punished as a traitor."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Thou wretch, despite o’erwhelm thee!"
      - "What should the people do with these bald tribunes?"
      - "On whom depending, their obedience fails"
      - "To the greater bench: in a rebellion,"
      - "When what’s not meet, but what must be, was law,"
      - "Then were they chosen: in a better hour,"
      - "Let what is meet be said it must be meet,"
      - "And throw their power i’ the dust."
    m:
      - "You wretch. I feel overwhelming contempt for you! Why should the people have these stupid tribunes? By depending on you, they fail to obey the Senate’s higher authority. In a rebellion, actions that are wrong but unavoidable are sanctioned because of the circumstances under which they are chosen. But when times are better, it must be said that what is right must be done. So throw the tribunes’ power in the garbage."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Manifest treason!"
    m:
      - "That’s blatantly treason!"

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "This a consul? no."
    m:
      - "This man is consul? No."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "The aediles, ho!"
