But I can’t be too obvious about being on your side without risking the life of your stepbrother, young George. If I’m seen helping you, George will be killed right in front of my eyes. Farewell. The lack of time and the risk I’m under will have to keep us from bonding and catching up on each other’s news the way we usually would after not seeing each other for so long.

<p>Why, then, it’s time to put on my armor and instruct the troops. <em>(to his soldiers)</em> I can’t tell you much right now, loyal countrymen, because we don’t have time. But know this: We have God and a good cause on our side. The prayers of saints and those that Richard wronged support us like high-walled fortresses. Other than Richard, even those whom we fight against would rather we won. Because who is this man they follow? Truly, gentlemen, a violent tyrant and a murderer, who rose to his high position by shedding blood and kept the position the same way. He rose to the top by means of others and then slaughtered them. He’s like a worthless stone, who only seems like a valuable gem because he’s on the throne, where he doesn’t belong. He has always been God’s enemy. And when you fight God’s enemy, God will protect you. If you struggle to bring down a tyrant, you will sleep peacefully when the tyrant is killed. When you fight against your country’s enemies, you will be paid for your efforts with your country’s wealth. If you fight to protect your wives, your wives will welcome you home as conquerors. When you free your children from the sword, your grandchildren will repay you in your old age. So, in the name of God and all the good that will come of this battle, march with your flags high and draw your swords. As for me, if I fail, the only ransom I will offer the enemy is my corpse. But if I succeed, every one of you will share in the profit. Play boldly and cheerfully, drummers and trumpeters. Here’s to God and Saint George! To Richmond and victory!</p>

You have been sleeping soundly, and they bring unrest. You own land they want to steal. Those of you who are blessed with beautiful wives, they want to defile them. And who’s leading them but an inconsequential fellow who for the longest time lived in Brittany at his mother’s expense? A girly man, a man who never in his life felt more cold than seeps into one’s boots in the snow? Let’s send these stragglers back over the sea. Let’s whip these arrogant relics of France—these starving beggars, tired of their lives, who would have hanged themselves, poor rats, if it weren’t for this foolish enterprise they’ve been dreaming about—back to France. If we’re going to be conquered, let men conquer us, and not these French bastards whom our forefathers already beat, thrashed, and pummeled on their own turf, and shamed them forever in the history books. Should these people enjoy our lands? Sleep with our wives? Rape our daughters?</p>
