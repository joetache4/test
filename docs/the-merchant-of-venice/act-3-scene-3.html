<p>The duke cannot deny the course of law.</p>
<p>For the commodity that strangers have</p>
<p>With us in Venice, if it be denied,</p>
<p>Will much impeach the justice of his state,</p>
<p>Since that the trade and profit of the city</p>
<p>Consisteth of all nations. Therefore go.</p>
<p>These griefs and losses have so bated me,</p>
<p>That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh</p>
<p>Tomorrow to my bloody creditor.—</p>
<p>Well, jailer, on.—Pray God Bassanio come</p>
<p>To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.</p>
</td>

<b>ANTONIO</b>
<p>The duke can’t deny the law, because that would threaten the security of all foreign merchants in Venice, and that’s how the city makes its money. If the government disregards the law, it will be discredited. So go. I’ve lost so much weight worrying about my losses have that I’ll hardly have a pound of flesh to spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow.—Well, jailer, let’s go.—I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt. After that, I don’t care what happens.</p>
