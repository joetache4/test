<p>No shame but mine. I must, forsooth, be forced</p>

<p>Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior,</p>
<p>And, to be noted for a merry man,</p>
<p>He’ll woo a thousand, ’point the day of marriage,</p>
<p>Make friends, invite, and proclaim the banns,</p>
<p>Yet never means to wed where he hath wooed.</p>

<b>KATHERINE</b>
<p>The humiliation is all mine. You forced me to accept this man against my will, this fancy con artist who was in such a hurry to get engaged. He has no intention of marrying me. I knew it—I told you. The whole thing was a joke. He pretends to be this simple, backward guy, but it’s all a gag to amuse his witty friends. He goes around proposing to women—they set a date, he gets introduced around, they send out the invitations and make a public announcement, but he has no intention of going through with it. So now everyone will point at me and say, “Look, there goes the wife of that comedian Petruchio—if he could be bothered to marry the pathetic thing!”</p>

<p>Well, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old vest, a pair of old pants turned inside out, unmatched boots that have been used as spittoons, one buckled, the other laced; a rusty old sword from the town armory with a broken hilt and no scabbard. He’s got on worn-out garters and is riding a swayback old horse with a moth-eaten saddle, stirrups from two different sets, a bad hip, swollen glands, lockjaw, leg ulcers, bedsores, arthritis, jaundice, a hernia, hives, worms, cancer, a mossy overbite, and post-nasal drip. He’s knock-kneed too. His bit’s lopsided and his cardboard bridle, which breaks when you pull on it, is taped in a few places. The saddle strap is made out of patchwork, and the strap that goes under his tail to keep the saddle in place is velvet, with the initials of some woman written in studs.</p>

<p>Tut, she’s a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!</p>
<p>I’ll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest</p>
<p>Should ask if Katherine should be his wife,</p>
<p>“Ay, by gogs wouns!” quoth he, and swore so loud</p>
<p>That, all amazed, the priest let fall the book,</p>
<p>And as he stooped again to take it up,</p>
<p>The mad-brained bridegroom took him such a cuff</p>
<p>That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.</p>
<p>“Now take them up,” quoth he, “if any list.”</p>

<p>Why, she’s a lamb, a dove, a child compared to him! Picture this: when the priest asked Katherine if she would have him, he answered, “Hell, yes!” and swore so loud that the priest drops the prayer book. Everyone froze, and as the priest stooped to pick it up again the lunatic bridegroom smacked him so hard that the priest and book went flying! <em>Then</em> he said, “Now pick them up—if anyone dares.”</p>

<p>Trembled and shook, for why he stamped and swore</p>
<p>As if the vicar meant to cozen him.</p>
<p>But after many ceremonies done,</p>
<p>He calls for wine. “A health!” quoth he, as if</p>
<p>He had been aboard, carousing to his mates</p>
<p>After a storm; quaffed off the muscatel</p>
<p>And threw the sops all in the sexton’s face,</p>
<p>Having no other reason</p>
<p>But that his beard grew thin and hungerly</p>
<p>And seemed to ask him sops as he was drinking.</p>
<p>This done, he took the bride about the neck</p>
<p>And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack</p>
<p>That at the parting all the church did echo.</p>
<p>And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame,</p>
<p>And after me, I know, the rout is coming.</p>
<p>Such a mad marriage never was before.</p>

<p>She trembled and shook because he stamped and swore and carried on as though the vicar were trying to put something over on him. Finally, the ceremony done, he called for wine. “A health!” he shouted, like some sailor aboard ship, carousing with his mates after a storm. Then he chugs the wine and throws the dregs in the sexton’s face. Why? Because the fellow’s beard looked thin, he said, and it seemed to be asking him for the dregs while he was drinking. Next he slung his arm around the bride’s neck and kissed her with such a smack that when they parted the sound of their lips made the whole church echo. That was the limit for me. I got out of there as fast as I could. I know the rest of the crowd isn’t far behind me. It’s disgraceful! You never saw such a mockery of a marriage in your life!</p>
