<p>Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.</p>
<p>It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out,</p>
<p>To let him live. Where he arrives he moves</p>
<p>All hearts against us. Edmund I think is gone</p>
<p>In pity of his misery to dispatch</p>
<p>His nighted life; moreover to descry</p>
<p>The strength o’ th’ enemy.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>REGAN</b>
<p>He rushed away on serious business. It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him. Wherever he goes, he inspires compassion and people turn against us. I think Edmund went off to kill him, to put him out of his blind misery. And also to find out the size of the enemy army.</p>

<p>I know what I’m talking about. You’re close to her, I know it. So I recommend you take note of what I’m about to say. My husband is dead. Edmund and I have talked, and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril. You can figure out the rest. If you find him, please give him this. And when your mistress hears about all this, please tell her to use her head next time. So goodbye. If you happen to hear anything about that blind traitor Gloucester, I’ll reward anyone who snuffs him out.</p>
