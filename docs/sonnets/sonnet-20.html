<p>A woman’s face, with nature’s own hand painted,</p>

<p>Your face is as pretty as a woman’s, but you don’t even have to use makeup—you, the man (or should I say<em>woman</em>?) I love. Your heart is as gentle as a woman’s, but it isn’t cheating like theirs. Your eyes are prettier than women’s, but not as roving—you bless everything you look at. You’ve got the good looks of a handsome man, but you attract both women<em>and</em> men. When Mother Nature made you, she originally intended to make you a woman, but then she got carried away with her creation and screwed me by adding a certain<em>thing</em> that I have no use for. But since she gave you a prick to please women, I’ll keep your love, and they can enjoy your body.</p>
