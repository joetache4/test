      - "With heigh! the doxy over the dale,"
      - "Why, then comes in the sweet o’ the year;"
      - "For the red blood reigns in the winter’s pale."
      - "The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,"
      - "With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!"
      - "Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;"
      - "For a quart of ale is a dish for a king."
      - "The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,"
      - "With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,"
      - "Are summer songs for me and my aunts,"
      - "While we lie tumbling in the hay."

      - "My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to"
      - "lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who"
      - "being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise"
      - "a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and"
      - "drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is"
      - "the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful"
      - "on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to"
      - "me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought"
      - "of it. A prize! a prize!"
    m:
      - "When daffodils begin to sprout, with the poor wench over the hills, why then it’s the sweetest part of the year as red blood reigns in flesh made pale by winter. The white sheet airing out on the hedge, and oh, the sweet birds singing, makes my thieving fingers itch, and a quart of beer is a drink for a king! The lark chants “tirra-lyra,” and the thrush and the jay sing, while my mistress and I tumble about in the hay. I have served Prince Florizel and worn three-piled velvet, but now I’m unemployed. But should I mourn for that, my dear? The pale moon shines at night, and in wandering here and there, I take the right course through life. If menders of metal pots have the right to live and bear the burden of their tool bag, then I can tell my own story and in the stocks. I deal in sheets, and when the thieving bird builds his nest, he takes up poorer linen. My father named me Autolycus. Like me he was born under Mercury, and like me he would steal those little things left unsecured. By gambling and pimping I bought this outfit, and my income is from little deceptions. Being a highwayman might get me hanged or beat, which are terrors to me, and as for the afterlife, I try not to think about it. Oh, look—a prize!"

      - "yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred"
      - "shorn. what comes the wool to?"
    m:
      - "Let’s see. Every eleven sheep gives about twenty-eight pounds of wool. Every twenty-eight pounds of wool earns a pound and some shillings. If we’ve shorn fifteen hundred sheep, how much does that come to?"

    o:
      - "I cannot do’t without counters. Let me see; what am"
      - "I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound"
      - "of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,—what will"
      - "this sister of mine do with rice? But my father"
      - "hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it"
      - "on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for"
      - "the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good"
      - "ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but"
      - "one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to"
      - "horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden"
      - "pies; mace; dates?—none, that’s out of my note;"
      - "nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I"
      - "may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of"
      - "raisins o’ the sun."
    m:
      - "I can’t do it without something to add it up. Let’s see, what do I need to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pounds of sugar, five pounds of currants, rice. What does my sister need rice for? But my father has put her in charge of the feast, and she is doing a good job with it. She’s made twenty-four small bouquets for the shearers, who can all sing three-part songs, and very well. But they are mostly tenors and basses, and one is so saintly he sings psalms for dances. I have to get saffron to color the pear pies. Do I need mace and dates? No, that’s not on my list. Seven nutmegs, some ginger root—though I might be able to get that for free—and four pounds each of prunes and raisins."

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay"
      - "on thee, rather than have these off."
    m:
      - "Alas, poor soul! You need more rags to cover you, not to take your rags off."

  - sp: AUTOLYCUS
    o:
      - "O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more"
      - "than the stripes I have received, which are mighty"

      - "Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he"
      - "has left with thee: if this be a horseman’s coat,"
      - "it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,"
      - "I’ll help thee: come, lend me thy hand."
    m:
      - "Indeed, he should be a man on foot, judging by those clothes. If it were the coat of a man on a horse, it has seen some terrible service. Give me your hand, and I’ll help you. Here, give me your hand."

    m:
      - "Do you need money? I have a little I can give you."

  - sp: AUTOLYCUS
    o:
      - "No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have"
      - "a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,"
      - "unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or"
      - "any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;"
      - "that kills my heart."
    m:
      - "No, good kind sir, I beg you. I have a relative less than a mile from here whom I was going to visit. He can give me money or whatever I need. Please, don’t offer me money. That kills me."

    o:

      - "prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his"
      - "virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court."
    m:
      - "A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with prostitutes. I know he was once a servant of the prince. I’m not sure, good sir, for which of his virtues it was, but he certainly got whipped out of court."

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "His vices, you would say; there’s no virtue whipped"
      - "out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay"
      - "there; and yet it will no more but abide."
    m:
      - "Vices, you mean, since virtues aren’t whipped out of court. They cherish virtues there, and yet they won’t stay there long."

  - sp: AUTOLYCUS
    o:
      - "Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he"
      - "hath been since an ape-bearer; then a"
      - "process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a"
      - "motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker’s"
      - "wife within a mile where my land and living lies;"
      - "and, having flown over many knavish professions, he"
      - "settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus."
    m:
      - "I would say vices, sir. I know this man well. Since he left he has been a performer with a monkey, then a summons server, a bailiff, and then he came up with a puppet show about the Prodigal Son, and then he married a pot-mender’s wife within a mile of my property. Having entered and abandoned all these disreputable professions, he finally settled on being a rogue. Some call him Autolycus."

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts"
      - "wakes, fairs and bear-baitings."
    m:
      - "A curse on him! A crook, upon my life, a crook. He lingers about funerals, fairs, and bear-baitings."

  - sp: AUTOLYCUS
    o:
      - "Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that’s the rogue that"
      - "put me into this apparel."
    m:
      - "Very true, sir, that’s him, the rogue that put me in these clothes."

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had"
      - "but looked big and spit at him, he’ld have run."
    m:
      - "There’s no more cowardly rogue in all of Bohemia. If you had looked large and had spit at him, he would have run."

  - sp: AUTOLYCUS
    o:
      - "I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am"
      - "false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant"
      - "him."
    m:
      - "I have to confess to you, sir, I’m not a fighter. I’m too faint at heart, and I’m sure he knew it."

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "How do you now?"
    m:
      - "How are you now?"

  - sp: AUTOLYCUS
    o:
      - "Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and"
      - "walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace"
      - "softly towards my kinsman’s."
    m:
      - "Kind sir, much better now than before. I can stand on my own and walk. I’ll even say goodbye to you, and make my way carefully to my relative’s home."

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "Shall I bring thee on the way?"
    m:
      - "Shall I help you there?"

      - "shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name"
      - "put in the book of virtue!"
    m:
      - "Your purse is not full enough to purchase your spices. I’ll join you at your sheep-shearing, too. If I don’t make this deception lead to another and prove the shearers as stupid as sheep, let me be removed from the list of thieves and my name become known for virtue!"
