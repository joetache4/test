      - "How long is ’t now since last yourself and I"
      - "Were in a mask?"
    m:
      - "Welcome, gentlemen. The ladies who don’t have corns on their toes will dance with you. Ha, my ladies, which of you will refuse to dance now? Whichever of you acts shy, I’ll swear she has corns. Does that hit close to home? Welcome, gentlemen. There was a time when I could wear a mask over my eyes and charm a lady by whispering a story in her ear. That time is gone, gone, gone. You are welcome gentlemen. Come on, musicians, play music. *(music plays and they dance, ROMEO stands apart)* Make room in the hall. Make room in the hall. Shake a leg, girls*. (to SERVINGMEN)* More light, you rascals. Flip over the tables and get them out of the way. And put the fire out—it’s getting too hot in here. *(to his COUSIN)* Ah, my man, this unexpected fun feels good. No, sit down, sit down, my good Capulet cousin. You and I are too old to dance. *(CAPULET and his COUSIN sit down)* How long is it now since you and I last wore masks at a party like this?"

      - "Some five and twenty years, and then we masked."
    m:
      - "What, man? It’s not that long, it’s not that long. It’s been since Lucentio’s wedding. Let the years fly by as fast as they like, it’s only been twenty-five years since we wore masks."

  - sp: CAPULET’S COUSIN
    o:
      - "’Tis more, ’tis more. His son is elder, sir."
      - "His son is thirty."
    m:
      - "It’s been longer, it’s been longer. Lucentio’s son is older than that, sir. He’s thirty years old."

    o:
      - "  Will you tell me that?"
      - "His son was but a ward two years ago."

  - sp: ROMEO
    o:
      - "Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!"
      - "It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night"
      - "Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope’s ear,"
      - "Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear."
      - "So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows"
      - "As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows."
      - "The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,"
      - "And, touching hers, make blessèd my rude hand."
      - "Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!"
      - "For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night."
    m:
      - "Oh, she shows the torches how to burn bright! She stands out against the darkness like a jeweled earring hanging against the cheek of an African. Her beauty is too good for this world; she’s too beautiful to die and be buried. She outshines the other women like a white dove in the middle of a flock of crows. When this dance is over, I’ll see where she stands, and then I’ll touch her hand with my rough and ugly one. Did my heart ever love anyone before this moment? My eyes were liars, then, because I never saw true beauty before tonight."

  - sp: TYBALT
    o:
      - "This, by his voice, should be a Montague.—"
      - "*(to his PAGE)* Fetch me my rapier, boy.—"
      - "What, dares the slave"
      - "Come hither, covered with an antic face,"
      - "To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?"
      - "Now, by the stock and honor of my kin,"
      - "To strike him dead I hold it not a sin."
    m:
      - "I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague. *(to his PAGE)* Get me my sword, boy.*—*What, does this peasant dare to come here with his face covered by a mask to sneer at and scorn our celebration? Now, by the honor of our family, I do not consider it a crime to kill him."

  - sp: CAPULET
    o:
      - "Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?"
    m:
      - "Why, what’s going on here, nephew? Why are you acting so angry?"

  - sp: TYBALT
    o:
      - "Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,"
      - "A villain that is hither come in spite"
      - "To scorn at our solemnity this night."
    m:
      - "Uncle, this man is a Montague—our enemy. He’s a scoundrel who’s come here out of spite to mock our party."

    o:
      - "Content thee, gentle coz. Let him alone."
      - "He bears him like a portly gentleman,"
      - "And, to say truth, Verona brags of him"
      - "To be a virtuous and well-governed youth."
      - "I would not for the wealth of all the town"
      - "Here in my house do him disparagement."
      - "Therefore be patient. Take no note of him."
      - "It is my will, the which if thou respect,"
      - "Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,"
      - "An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast."
    m:
      - "Calm down, gentle cousin. Leave him alone. He carries himself like a dignified gentleman, and, to tell you the truth, he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man. I wouldn’t insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town. So calm down. Just ignore him. That’s what I want, and if you respect my wishes, you’ll look nice and stop frowning because that’s not the way you should behave at a feast."

  - sp: TYBALT
    o:
      - "It fits when such a villain is a guest."
      - "I’ll not endure him."
    m:
      - "It’s the right way to act when a villain like him shows up. I won’t tolerate him."

  - sp: CAPULET
    o:
      - "  He shall be endured."
      - "What, goodman boy! I say, he shall. Go to."
      - "Am I the master here, or you? Go to."
      - "You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,"
      - "You’ll make a mutiny among my guests."
      - "You will set cock-a-hoop. You’ll be the man!"
    m:
      - "You *will* tolerate him. What, little man? I say you will. What the—Am I the boss here or you? What the—You won’t tolerate him! God help me! You’ll start a riot among my guests! There will be chaos! It will be your fault, you’ll be the rabble-rouser!"

  - sp: TYBALT
    o:
      - "Why, uncle, ’tis a shame."
    m:
      - "But, uncle, we’re being disrespected."

  - sp: CAPULET
    o:
      - "    Go to, go to."
      - "You are a saucy boy. Is ’t so, indeed?"
      - "This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what."
      - "You must contrary me. Marry, ’tis time.—"
      - "Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox, go."
      - "Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame!"
      - "I’ll make you quiet.—What, cheerly, my hearts!"
    m:
      - "Go on, go on. You’re an insolent little boy. Is that how it is, really? This stupidity will come back to bite you. I know what I’ll do. You have to contradict me, do you? I’ll teach you a lesson. *(to the GUESTS)* Well done, my dear guests! *(to TYBALT)* You’re a punk, get away. Keep your mouth shut, or else— *(to SERVINGMEN)* more light, more light! *(to TYBALT)* You should be ashamed. ’ll shut you up. *(to the guests)* Keep having fun, my dear friends!"

      - "This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this:"
      - "My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand"
      - "To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss."
    m:
      - "*(taking JULIET’s hand)* Your hand is like a holy place that my hand is unworthy to visit. If you’re offended by the touch of my hand, my two lips are standing here like blushing pilgrims, ready to make things better with a kiss."

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,"
      - "Which mannerly devotion shows in this,"
      - "For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,"
      - "And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss."
    m:
      - "Good pilgrim, you don’t give your hand enough credit. By holding my hand you show polite devotion. After all, pilgrims touch the hands of statues of saints. Holding one palm against another is like a kiss."

  - sp: ROMEO
    o:
      - "Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
    m:
      - "Don’t saints and pilgrims have lips too?"

    m:
      - "Yes, pilgrim—they have lips that they’re supposed to pray with."

  - sp: ROMEO
    o:
      - "O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do."
      - "They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
    m:
      - "Well then, saint, let lips do what hands do. I’m praying for you to kiss me. Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn’t turn to despair."

  - sp: JULIET
    o:
      - "Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake."
    m:

    o:
      - "Then move not, while my prayer’s effect I take."
      - "*(Kisses her)*"
      - "Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged."
    m:
      - "Then don’t move while I act out my prayer. *(He kisses her)*. Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours."

  - sp: JULIET

      - "Shall have the chinks."
    m:
