  - os: "Enter the DUKE, the magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others"
    ms: "The DUKE , the magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO, and attendants all enter."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "What, is Antonio here?"
    m:
      - "Is Antonio here?"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "Ready, so please your grace."
    m:
      - "Yes, sir, I’m here."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "I am sorry for thee. Thou art come to answer"
      - "A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch"
      - "Uncapable of pity, void and empty"
      - "From any dram of mercy."
    m:
      - "I feel sorry for you. You’ve come to face a ruthless enemy, an inhuman wretch incapable of pity, without any feelings of mercy."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "    I have heard"
      - "Your grace hath ta’en great pains to qualify"
      - "His rigorous course. But since he stands obdurate"
      - "And that no lawful means can carry me"
      - "Out of his envy’s reach, I do oppose"
      - "My patience to his fury, and am armed"
      - "To suffer with a quietness of spirit"
      - "The very tyranny and rage of his."
    m:
      - "They tell me you’ve done everything you can to talk him out of what he’s doing. But since he remains stubborn, and there’s no legal way to protect me from his malice, I’ll just have to take what he’ll give me. I’m ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Go, one, and call the Jew into the court."
    m:
      - "One of you go call the Jew into court here."

  - sp: SALERIO
    o:
      - "He is ready at the door. He comes, my lord."
    m:
      - "He’s standing ready outside the door. Here he comes, my lord."

  - os: "Enter SHYLOCK"
    ms: "SHYLOCK enters."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Make room, and let him stand before our face.—"
      - "Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,"
      - "That thou but lead’st this fashion of thy malice"
      - "To the last hour of act, and then ’tis thought"
      - "Thou’lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange"
      - "Than is thy strange apparent cruelty,"
      - "And where thou now exacts the penalty—"
      - "Which is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh—"
      - "Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture"
      - "But—touched with human gentleness and love,—"
      - "Forgive a moiety of the principal,"
      - "Glancing an eye of pity on his losses"
      - "That have of late so huddled on his back"
      - "Eno’ to press a royal merchant down"
      - "And pluck commiseration of his state"
      - "From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,"
      - "From stubborn Turks and Tartars never trained"
      - "To offices of tender courtesy."
      - "We all expect a gentle answer, Jew."
    m:
      - "Make room so he can stand in front of me. Shylock, everyone thinks—and I agree—that you’re just pretending to be cruel. They think that at the last second you’re going to show mercy and pity, which will be more surprising than the bizarre cruelty that you seem to be showing now. And even though you’re here to collect the penalty—a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh—they think you’ll not only let it go, but out of humanity and love you’ll forgive some portion of the principal he owes you too. In doing so you’ll be taking pity on him for his many recent losses, which have been large enough to send even the greatest merchant out of business, and make even the most hard-hearted Turk or Tartar feel sorry for him. What do you say? We all expect a nice answer from you, Jew."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "I have possessed your grace of what I purpose,"
      - "And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn"
      - "To have the due and forfeit of my bond."
      - "If you deny it, let the danger light"
      - "Upon your charter and your city’s freedom."
      - "You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have"
      - "A weight of carrion flesh than to receive"
      - "Three thousand ducats. I’ll not answer that"
      - "But say it is my humour. Is it answered?"
      - "What if my house be troubled with a rat"
      - "And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats"
      - "To have it baned? What, are you answered yet?"
      - "Some men there are love not a gaping pig,"
      - "Some that are mad if they behold a cat,"
      - "And others, when the bagpipe sings i’ th’ nose,"
      - "Cannot contain their urine. For affection,"
      - "Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood"
      - "Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:"
      - "As there is no firm reason to be rendered"
      - "Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;"
      - "Why he, a harmless necessary cat;"
      - "Why he, a woollen bagpipe, but of force"
      - "Must yield to such inevitable shame"
      - "As to offend, himself being offended—"
      - "So can I give no reason, nor I will not"
      - "(More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing"
      - "I bear Antonio), that I follow thus"
      - "A losing suit against him. Are you answered?"
    m:
      - "I’ve told you what I intend to do, and I’ve sworn by the holy Sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract. If you refuse to allow me to do so, your city’s charter and its freedom are endangered. You’re going to ask me why I’d rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats. I won’t answer that. Let’s just say it’s because I feel like it. Is that enough of an answer? What if I had a rat in my house, and I felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated? Do you have your answer yet? Some men don’t like roast pig, others go crazy if they see a cat, and others can’t help urinating when they hear bagpipes. There’s no sense trying to explain people’s likes and dislikes. So, to answer your question. Just as there’s no clear reason why one man doesn’t want a roast pig, or why another man can’t stand a harmless and useful cat, or another can’t tolerate bagpipes, so I can’t give a reason, and I won’t give a reason (other than the simple hate and loathing I feel for Antonio) why I’m pursuing this unprofitable case against him. Does that answer your question?"

  - sp: BASSANIO
    o:
      - "This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,"
      - "To excuse the current of thy cruelty."
    m:
      - "That’s no answer, you heartless man. It doesn’t excuse your cruel behavior."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "I am not bound to please thee with my answers."
    m:
      - "I don’t have to give you answers that you like."

  - sp: BASSANIO
    o:
      - "Do all men kill the things they do not love?"
    m:
      - "Does everyone kill what they don’t love?"

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "Hates any man the thing he would not kill?"
    m:
      - "Does anyone hate something and not want to kill it?"

  - sp: BASSANIO
    o:
      - "Every offense is not a hate at first."
    m:
      - "Disliking something isn’t the same thing as hating it."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?"
    m:
      - "What, would you let a snake bite you twice?"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "*(to BASSANIO)*"
      - "I pray you, think you question with the Jew?"
      - "You may as well go stand upon the beach"
      - "And bid the main flood bate his usual height."
      - "You may as well use question with the wolf"
      - "Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb."
      - "You may as well forbid the mountain pines"
      - "To wag their high tops and to make no noise"
      - "When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven."
      - "You may as well do anything most hard,"
      - "As seek to soften that—than which what’s harder?—"
      - "His Jewish heart. Therefore I do beseech you"
      - "Make no more offers, use no farther means,"
      - "But with all brief and plain conveniency"
      - "Let me have judgment and the Jew his will."
    m:
      - "*(to BASSANIO)* Please don’t bother arguing with the Jew. You might as well go stand on the beach and ask the ocean to get smaller. You might as well ask a wolf why he killed the lamb and made its mother cry. You might as well tell the pine trees on the mountain to stop waving their treetops when the storms blow through them. You might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his Jewish heart. It’s the hardest thing imaginable. Therefore I’m begging you, don’t make any more offers, don’t look for other ways to stop him. Just let me receive my punishment, and let the Jew take his penalty."

  - sp: BASSANIO
    o:
      - "*(to SHYLOCK)* For thy three thousand ducats here is six."
    m:
      - "*(to SHYLOCK)* Instead of your three thousand ducats, here are six thousand."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "If every ducat in six thousand ducats"
      - "Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,"
      - "I would not draw them. I would have my bond."
    m:
      - "If you offered me six times that, I wouldn’t accept it. I would choose to take my penalty."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?"
    m:
      - "How can you ever hope for mercy for yourself, when you don’t give any now?"

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?"
      - "You have among you many a purchased slave,"
      - "Which—like your asses and your dogs and mules—"
      - "You use in abject and in slavish parts"
      - "Because you bought them. Shall I say to you,"
      - "“Let them be free! Marry them to your heirs!"
      - "Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds"
      - "Be made as soft as yours and let their palates"
      - "Be seasoned with such viands”? You will answer,"
      - "“The slaves are ours.” So do I answer you."
      - "The pound of flesh which I demand of him"
      - "Is dearly bought. ’Tis mine and I will have it."
      - "If you deny me, fie upon your law—"
      - "There is no force in the decrees of Venice."
      - "I stand for judgment. Answer, shall I have it?"
    m:
      - "Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I haven’t done anything wrong? Many of you own slaves, which—like your donkeys and dogs and mules—you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them. Should I say to you, “Set them free! Let them marry your children! Why are you making them work so hard? Let their beds be as soft as yours, and let them eat the same food as you”? No, you’d answer, “The slaves are ours.” And that’s just how I’m answering you. The pound of flesh that I want from him was very expensive. It’s mine and I’m going to get it. If you refuse me, the laws of Venice have no validity. I await justice. So answer me. Will I get it?"

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Upon my power I may dismiss this court,"
      - "Unless Bellario, a learnèd doctor,"
      - "Whom I have sent for to determine this,"
      - "Come here today."
    m:
      - "I have the authority to dismiss this court, unless Bellario comes today. He’s a legal expert I sent for to act as judge and help settle this matter."

  - sp: SALERIO
    o:
      - "  My lord, here stays without"
      - "A messenger with letters from the doctor,"
      - "New come from Padua."
    m:
      - "My lord, a messenger is waiting outside with letters from Bellario. He’s just come from Padua."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Bring us the letter. Call the messenger."
    m:
      - "Bring us the letters. Call the messenger in."

  - sp: BASSANIO
    o:
      - "Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!"
      - "The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,"
      - "Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood."
    m:
      - "Cheer up, Antonio! Keep up your courage, man! I’ll give the Jew my flesh, blood, bones, and everything before you lose one drop of blood for me."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "I am a tainted wether of the flock,"
      - "Meetest for death. The weakest kind of fruit"
      - "Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me."
      - "You cannot better be employed, Bassanio,"
      - "Than to live still and write mine epitaph."
    m:
      - "I’m like the one sick sheep in the flock, the one who deserves to die. The weakest fruit drops to the ground first, so let me drop. Bassanio, the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone."

  - os: "Enter NERISSA, disguised as a clerk"
    ms: "NERISSA enters, disguised as a lawyer’s clerk."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Came you from Padua, from Bellario?"
    m:
      - "Have you come from Bellario’s office in Padua?"

  - sp: NERISSA
    o:
      - "From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace."
      - "*(gives DUKE a letter)*"
    m:
      - "Yes, my lord. Bellario sends his greetings. *(she gives the DUKE a letter)*"

  - os: "SHYLOCK sharpens a knife on the bottom of his shoe"
    ms: "SHYLOCK sharpens his knife on the sole of his shoe."

  - sp: BASSANIO
    o:
      - "*(to SHYLOCK)* Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?"
    m:
      - "*(to SHYLOCK)* Why are you sharpening your knife so eagerly?"

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there."
    m:
      - "To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there."

  - sp: GRATIANO
    o:
      - "Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,"
      - "Thou makest thy knife keen. But no metal can—"
      - "No, not the hangman’s axe—bear half the keenness"
      - "Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?"
    m:
      - "You’re sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul, you cruel Jew. No metal—not even the executioner’s axe—could ever be half as sharp as your hatred. Can’t any prayers reach your heart?"

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "No, none that thou hast wit enough to make."
    m:
      - "No, none that you’re smart enough to make."

  - sp: GRATIANO
    o:
      - "O, be thou damned, inexecrable dog,"
      - "And for thy life let justice be accused!"
      - "Thou almost makest me waver in my faith"
      - "To hold opinion with Pythagoras"
      - "That souls of animals infuse themselves"
      - "Into the trunks of men. Thy currish spirit"
      - "Governed a wolf who, hanged for human slaughter,"
      - "Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,"
      - "And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam"
      - "Infused itself in thee, for thy desires"
      - "Are wolvish, bloody, starved, and ravenous."
    m:
      - "Oh, you’re going to hell, you disgusting dog. Killing you would be justice. You almost make me forget that I’m a Christian. You make me want to agree with the philosopher Pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies. Your vicious dog soul used to belong to a wolf that was killed for slaughtering humans. When he died, his cruel soul passed out of his body and went into yours while you were lying in your unholy mother’s womb. That’s why your desires are wolfish, bloody, and ravenous."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,"
      - "Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud."
      - "Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall"
      - "To cureless ruin. I stand here for law."
    m:
      - "Unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract, you’re just wearing out your lungs by speaking so loud. Be quiet, boy, or you’ll lose your mind. I stand here with the law on my side."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "This letter from Bellario doth commend"
      - "A young and learnèd doctor to our court."
      - "Where is he?"
    m:
      - "This letter from Bellario introduces us to a young and well-educated legal expert. Where is he?"

  - sp: NERISSA
    o:
      - "  He attendeth here hard by"
      - "To know your answer whether you’ll admit him."
    m:
      - "He’s waiting nearby to find out if you’ll invite him in."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "With all my heart.—Some three or four of you"
      - "Go give him courteous conduct to this place.—"
      - "Meantime the court shall hear Bellario’s letter."
      - "*(reads)*"
      - "“Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant. We turned o’er many books together. He is furnished with my opinion, which—bettered with his own learning, the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend—comes with him at my importunity to fill up your grace’s request in my stead.I beseech you, let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation.”"
    m:
      - "With all my heart.—Three or four of you go welcome him.—In the meantime, I’ll read Bellario’s letter out loud."
      - "*(he reads)*"
      - "“I’ve received your letter but I’m very sick at the moment. As it happened, when your messenger came, a young lawyer from Rome was visiting me. His name is Balthazar. I told him about the case of the Jew and Antonio the merchant, and we consulted many books together. He knows my legal opinions about this matter, and he has his own expert opinions as well. I’m sending him in my place to answer your request for someone to act as judge in this matter. Please don’t underestimate him because he’s so young. I never knew such a young man with such a mature head. I leave him to you. When you put him to the test, you’ll see how wonderful he really is. You hear what the wise and educated Bellario writes.”"

  - os: "Enter PORTIA for Balthazar, disguised as a doctor of law"
    ms: "PORTIA enters disguised as Balthazar, a lawyer."

  - o:
      - "You hear the learned Bellario, what he writes."
      - "And here I take it is the doctor come.—"
      - "Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?"
    m:
      - "And this is the legal professor, I take it.—Let me shake your hand. Did old Bellario send you here?"

  - sp: PORTIA
    o:
      - "I did, my lord."
    m:
      - "Yes, my lord."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "  You are welcome. Take your place."
      - "Are you acquainted with the difference"
      - "That holds this present question in the court?"
    m:
      - "Welcome. Please have a seat. Are you familiar with the case currently before the court?"

  - sp: PORTIA
    o:
      - "I am informèd thoroughly of the cause."
      - "Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?"
    m:
      - "Yes, thoroughly. Which one is the merchant? And which one is the Jew?"

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth."
    m:
      - "Antonio and Shylock, both of you come forward."

  - sp: PORTIA
    o:
      - "Is your name Shylock?"
    m:
      - "Is your name Shylock?"

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "    Shylock is my name."
    m:
      - "Shylock is my name."

  - sp: PORTIA
    o:
      - "Of a strange nature is the suit you follow,"
      - "Yet in such rule that the Venetian law"
      - "Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.—"
      - "*(to ANTONIO)* You stand within his danger, do you not?"
    m:
      - "Your case is most unusual, though the Venetian law can’t stop you from proceeding.—*(to ANTONIO)* He has a claim on you, correct?"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "Ay, so he says."
    m:
      - "Yes, so he says."

  - sp: PORTIA
    o:
      - "  Do you confess the bond?"
    m:
      - "Do you acknowledge the contract?"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "I do."
    m:
      - "Yes, I do."

  - sp: PORTIA
    o:
      - "  Then must the Jew be merciful."
    m:
      - "Then the Jew must show you mercy."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "On what compulsion must I? Tell me that."
    m:
      - "Why do I have to do that? Tell me."

  - sp: PORTIA
    o:
      - "The quality of mercy is not strained."
      - "It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven"
      - "Upon the place beneath. It is twice blessed:"
      - "It blesseth him that gives and him that takes."
      - "’Tis mightiest in the mightiest. It becomes"
      - "The thronèd monarch better than his crown."
      - "His scepter shows the force of temporal power,"
      - "The attribute to awe and majesty"
      - "Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings,"
      - "But mercy is above this sceptered sway."
      - "It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings."
      - "It is an attribute to God himself."
      - "And earthly power doth then show likest God’s"
      - "When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,"
      - "Though justice be thy plea, consider this—"
      - "That in the course of justice none of us"
      - "Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,"
      - "And that same prayer doth teach us all to render"
      - "The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much"
      - "To mitigate the justice of thy plea,"
      - "Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice"
      - "Must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant there."
    m:
      - "No one shows mercy because he has to. It just happens, the way gentle rain drops on the ground. Mercy is a double blessing. It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it. It’s strongest in the strongest people. It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him. The king’s scepter represents his earthly power, the symbol of majesty, the focus of royal authority. But mercy is higher than the scepter. It’s enthroned in the hearts of kings, a quality of God himself. Kingly power seems most like God’s power when the king mixes mercy with justice. So although justice is your plea, Jew, consider this. Justice won’t save our souls. We pray for mercy, and this same prayer teaches us to show mercy to others as well. I’ve told you this to make you give up this case. If you pursue it, this strict court of Venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there."

  - sp: SHYLOCK
    o:
      - "My deeds upon my head. I crave the law,"
      - "The penalty, and forfeit of my bond."
    m:
      - "I take all responsibility for my decisions. I want the law, the penalty, and the fulfillment of my contract."

  - sp: PORTIA
    o:
      - "Is he not able to discharge the money?"
    m:
      - "Can’t he pay back the money?"

  - sp: BASSANIO
    o:
      - "Yes, here I tender it for him in the court—"
      - "Yea, twice the sum. If that will not suffice,"
      - "I will be bound to pay it ten times o’er,"
      - "On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart."
      - "If this will not suffice, it must appear"
      - "That malice bears down truth.—"

      - "Of grievous penalties, in lieu whereof"

      - "We freely cope your courteous pains withal."
    m:
      - "*(to PORTIA)* Sir, thanks to you my friend and I have been freed from paying some awful penalties today. Instead of giving the Jew the three thousand ducats he’s owed, we give it to you in gratitude for your kind efforts."

    o:
      - "Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further."
      - "Take some remembrance of us as a tribute,"

I’ll wear them for your sake. *(to BASSANIO)* And as a souvenir of your appreciation, I’ll take this ring from you. Don’t pull your hand back. I won’t take anything more than this, and you can’t refuse me this."

      - "You teach me how a beggar should be answered."
    m:
      - "I see you like to make big offers, sir. First you taught me how to beg, and now I think you’re teaching me how a beggar should be answered."

      - "She would not hold out enemy forever"
      - "For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you."
    m:
