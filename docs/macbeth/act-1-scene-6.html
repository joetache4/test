<p>This guest of summer,</p>
<p>The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,</p>
<p>By his loved mansionry, that the heaven’s breath</p>
<p>Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,</p>
<p>Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird</p>
<p>Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.</p>
<p>Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,</p>
<p>The air is delicate.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>BANQUO</b>
<p>The fact that this summer bird, the house martin, builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are. There isn’t a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven’t built their hanging nests to sleep and breed. I’ve noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest.</p>
