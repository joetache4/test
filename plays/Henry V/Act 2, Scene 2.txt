  - os: "Enter EXETER, BEDFORD, and WESTMORELAND"
    ms: "EXETER, BEDFORD, and WESTMORELAND enter."

  - sp: BEDFORD
    o:
      - "’Fore God, his grace is bold to trust these traitors."
    m:
      - "I must say, the king is taking a bold risk letting these traitors go free."

  - sp: EXETER
    o:
      - "They shall be apprehended by and by."
    m:
      - "They’ll be arrested in a little while."

  - sp: WESTMORELAND
    o:
      - "How smooth and even they do bear themselves,"
      - "As if allegiance in their bosoms sat"
      - "Crownèd with faith and constant loyalty."
    m:
      - "How smooth and cool they seem! Just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful."

  - sp: BEDFORD
    o:
      - "The king hath note of all that they intend,"
      - "By interception which they dream not of."
    m:
      - "The king has been informed of all their plans, but they have no idea."

  - sp: EXETER
    o:
      - "Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,"
      - "Whom he hath dulled and cloyed with gracious favors—"
      - "That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell"
      - "His sovereign’s life to death and treachery!"
    m:
      - "No, but it’s unbelievable that the man who was his dearest friend, a man he has showered with love and favor, would repay the king with treachery, selling his own sovereign’s life to a foreign power!"

  - os: "Trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY, SCROOP, CAMBRIDGE, GREY, and attendants"
    ms: "Trumpets sound. KING HENRY, SCROOP, CAMBRIDGE, and GREY enter, with attendants."

  - sp: KING HENRY
    o:
      - "Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard."
      - "—My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,"
      - "And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts."
      - "Think you not that the powers we bear with us"
      - "Will cut their passage through the force of France,"
      - "Doing the execution and the act"
      - "For which we have in head assembled them?"
    m:
      - "Now that the wind is favorable, let’s board the ship.—My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you, my noble knight, what do you think? Will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of France, achieving and accomplishing everything I’ve assembled them to do?"

  - sp: SCROOP
    o:
      - "No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best."
    m:
      - "No doubt it will, my liege, if each man does his best."

  - sp: KING HENRY
    o:
      - "I doubt not that, since we are well-persuaded"
      - "We carry not a heart with us from hence"
      - "That grows not in a fair consent with ours,"
      - "Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish"
      - "Success and conquest to attend on us."
    m:
      - "I have no doubt about that, since I know there isn’t a man among us who isn’t with me wholeheartedly, or a soul left behind who doesn’t wish us success and conquest."

  - sp: CAMBRIDGE
    o:
      - "Never was monarch better feared and loved"
      - "Than is your Majesty. There’s not, I think, a subject"
      - "That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness"
      - "Under the sweet shade of your government."
    m:
      - "There never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself, your Majesty. I don’t think there’s a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government."

  - sp: GREY
    o:
      - "True. Those that were your father’s enemies"
      - "Have steeped their galls in honey, and do serve you"
      - "With hearts create of duty and of zeal."
    m:
      - "True. Those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness, serving you loyally and wholeheartedly."

  - sp: KING HENRY
    o:
      - "We therefore have great cause of thankfulness"
      - "And shall forget the office of our hand"
      - "Sooner than quittance of desert and merit"
      - "According to the weight and worthiness."
    m:
      - "Yes, I have great cause to be thankful. I’m more likely to forget how to use my own hand than how to reward virtue and merit as they deserve."

  - sp: SCROOP
    o:
      - "So service shall with steelèd sinews toil,"
      - "And labor shall refresh itself with hope"
      - "To do your Grace incessant services."
    m:
      - "And so your subjects serve you all the more energetically, hopeful of success and reward."

  - sp: KING HENRY
    o:
      - "We judge no less.—Uncle of Exeter,"
      - "Enlarge the man committed yesterday"
      - "That railed against our person. We consider"
      - "It was excess of wine that set him on,"
      - "And on his more advice we pardon him."
    m:
      - "I expect no less. Uncle of Exeter, release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me. I believe he only did it because he drank too much, and now that he’s had a chance to think about his actions, I can pardon him."

  - sp: SCROOP
    o:
      - "That’s mercy, but too much security."
      - "Let him be punished, sovereign, lest example"
      - "Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind."
    m:
      - "That’s merciful but a bit careless. He should be punished, your Majesty. If we tolerate such behavior, we’re in danger of encouraging it."

  - sp: KING HENRY
    o:
      - "Oh, let us yet be merciful."
    m:
      - "Oh, let us be merciful anyway."

  - sp: CAMBRIDGE
    o:
      - "So may Your Highness, and yet punish, too."
    m:
      - "Your Highness could be merciful but still punish."

  - sp: GREY
    o:
      - "Sir, you show great mercy if you give him life"
      - "After the taste of much correction."
    m:
      - "Sir, it would be merciful to let him live *after* beating him severely."

  - sp: KING HENRY
    o:
      - "Alas, your too much love and care of me"
      - "Are heavy orisons ’gainst this poor wretch."
      - "If little faults proceeding on distemper"
      - "Shall not be winked at, how shall we stretch our eye"
      - "When capital crimes, chewed, swallowed, and digested,"
      - "Appear before us? We’ll yet enlarge that man,"
      - "Though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their dear care"
      - "And tender preservation of our person,"
      - "Would have him punished. And now to our French causes."
      - "Who are the late commissioners?"
    m:
      - "I’m afraid your great love and concern for me lead you to deal too harshly with this poor fellow. If minor lapses caused by drunkenness are not to be tolerated, how will we punish capital crimes that result from much planning and forethought? No, I’ll have that man released, despite the fact that Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their extreme concern for my safety, would prefer that he were punished. And now, let’s turn to our business with the French. Who are the new commissioners?"

  - sp: CAMBRIDGE
    o:
      - "I one, my lord."
      - "Your Highness bade me ask for it today."
    m:
      - "I am one, my lord. Your Highness told me to ask for my commission today."

  - sp: SCROOP
    o:
      - "So did you me, my liege."
    m:
      - "You told me to do the same, my liege."

  - sp: GREY
    o:
      - "And I, my royal sovereign."
    m:
      - "And me, too, my royal sovereign."

  - sp: KING HENRY
    o:
      - "Then, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, there is yours."
      - "—There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham."
      - "—And, sir knight, Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours. *(gives each of them a paper)*"
      - "—Read them, and know I know your worthiness."
      - "—My Lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeter,"
      - "We will aboard tonight.—Why, how now, gentlemen?"
      - "What see you in those papers, that you lose"
      - "So much complexion?—Look you, how they change."
      - "Their cheeks are paper.—Why, what read you there"
      - "That have so cowarded and chased your blood"
      - "Out of appearance?"
    m:
      - "In that case, there is yours, Richard Earl of Cambridge; there yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight, Grey of Northumberland, this one is yours. *(he gives each of them a piece of paper)* Read them, and trust that I recognize your true worth. My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter, we will set sail night.—Why, what’s this, gentlemen! What’s in those papers that makes you change color?—Look how pale they’re turning! Their cheeks are like paper.—What are you reading that makes you turn white?"

  - sp: CAMBRIDGE
    o:
      - "I do confess my fault,"
      - "And do submit me to Your Highness’ mercy."
    m:
      - "I confess my crime and throw myself on your Highness’ mercy."

  - sp: GREY, SCROOP
    o:
      - "To which we all appeal."
    m:
      - "To which we all appeal."

  - sp: KING HENRY
    o:
      - "The mercy that was quick in us but late"
      - "By your own counsel is suppressed and killed."
      - "You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy,"
      - "For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,"
      - "As dogs upon their masters, worrying you."
      - "—See you, my princes and my noble peers,"
      - "These English monsters. My Lord of Cambridge here,"
      - "You know how apt our love was to accord"
      - "To furnish him with all appurtenants"
      - "Belonging to his honor, and this man"
      - "Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,"
      - "And sworn unto the practices of France,"
      - "To kill us here in Hampton; to the which"
      - "This knight, no less for bounty bound to us"
      - "Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn.—But Oh,"
      - "What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop, thou cruel,"
      - "Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature?"
      - "Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,"
      - "That knew’st the very bottom of my soul,"
      - "That almost mightst have coined me into gold,"
      - "Wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use—"
      - "May it be possible that foreign hire"
      - "Could out of thee extract one spark of evil"
      - "That might annoy my finger? ’Tis so strange"
      - "That, though the truth of it stands off as gross"
      - "As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it."
      - "Treason and murder ever kept together"
      - "As two yoke-devils sworn to either’s purpose,"
      - "Working so grossly in a natural cause"
      - "That admiration did not whoop at them."
      - "But thou, ’gainst all proportion, didst bring in"
      - "Wonder to wait on treason and on murder,"
      - "And whatsoever cunning fiend it was"
      - "That wrought upon thee so preposterously"
      - "Hath got the voice in hell for excellence."
      - "All other devils that suggest by treasons"
      - "Do botch and bungle up damnation"
      - "With patches, colors, and with forms being fetched"
      - "From glist’ring semblances of piety."
      - "But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up,"
      - "Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,"
      - "Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor."
      - "If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus"
      - "Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,"
      - "He might return to vasty Tartar back"
      - "And tell the legions “I can never win"
      - "A soul so easy as that Englishman’s.”"
      - "Oh, how hast thou with jealousy infected"
      - "The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?"
      - "Why, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learnèd?"
      - "Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?"
      - "Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious?"
      - "Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,"
      - "Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,"
      - "Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,"
      - "Garnished and decked in modest complement,"
      - "Not working with the eye without the ear,"
      - "And but in purgèd judgment trusting neither?"
      - "Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem."
      - "And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot"
      - "To mark the full-fraught man and best endued"
      - "With some suspicion. I will weep for thee,"
      - "For this revolt of thine methinks is like"
      - "Another fall of man.—Their faults are open."
      - "Arrest them to the answer of the law,"
      - "And God acquit them of their practices."
    m:
      - "The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice. For shame, don’t talk of mercy. Your own arguments turn against you, like dogs who bite their own masters.—Princes and noble peers, take a look at these English monsters. Cambridge here, you know how I favored him and treated him with every respect due his rank. He was bought for a few coins, entering easily into this conspiracy with the French, promising to kill me here in Southhampton. And this knight, whom I’ve treated as generously as I have Cambridge, also joined the plot. But, oh, what can I say to you, Lord Scroop? You cruel, ungrateful, savage, and inhuman creature! You who had access to all my thoughts, who knew me to the inmost part of my soul, who could have had any amount of gold from me if you’d needed it and only asked me: is it possible that a foreign power could find in you even enough evil to injure one of my fingers? Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white, I can scarcely believe it, it’s so past understanding. Treason and murder have always gone together, like two devils joined in a common purpose. That’s natural. But you, against all reason, added something new to the equation. You added the sheer improbability that you could do this. Whatever fiend it was that seduced you must win the prize for excellence in hell. All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive, put together from shreds and patches of righteousness. But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor. The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion, could return to hell and tell the devil’s legions, “I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman’s.” How you have poisoned my faith in people! Now I am suspicious of everyone. Are there men who appear dutiful? Why, so did you. Are there those who seem serious and knowledgeable? Why, so did you. Do they come from good families? Why, so did you. Do they seem religious? Why, so did you. Do they live in moderation, free from excessive emotion—stable rather than changing their minds constantly—tastefully dressed, not merely seeing but also listening, and trusting no impression without confirmation? That’s how sound a man you appeared. Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion. You have broken my heart. This treachery of yours is like the second Fall of man.—Their crimes are revealed. Arrest and punish them according to the law, and may God pardon them for what they would have done."

    o:
      - "I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of"
      - "Richard, Earl of Cambridge."

    m:
      - "Richard Earl of Cambridge, I arrest you for high treason. Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, I arrest you for high treason. Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland, I arrest you for high treason."

    o:
      - "Our purposes God justly hath discovered,"
      - "And I repent my fault more than my death,"
      - "Which I beseech Your Highness to forgive,"
      - "Although my body pay the price of it."
    m:
      - "A just God has discovered our plot. I regret my crime more than my death, and I beg your Highness to forgive me, while punishing my body with death."

  - sp: CAMBRIDGE
    o:
      - "For me, the gold of France did not seduce,"
      - "Although I did admit it as a motive"
      - "The sooner to effect what I intended;"
      - "But God be thankèd for prevention,"
      - "Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,"
      - "Beseeching God and you to pardon me."
    m:
      - "For my part, I didn’t do it for the money, though I admit the money encouraged me to do what I was planning sooner. But I thank God that I failed in my scheme, and I rejoice in paying the penalty, as I beg God and you to pardon me."

  - sp: GREY
    o:
      - "Never did faithful subject more rejoice"
      - "At the discovery of most dangerous treason"
      - "Than I do at this hour joy o’er myself,"
      - "Prevented from a damnèd enterprise."
      - "My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign."
    m:
      - "No faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than I now rejoice that I was thwarted in a damnable undertaking. Pardon my crime, sovereign, but not my person."

  - sp: KING HENRY
    o:
      - "God quit you in His mercy. Hear your sentence:"
      - "You have conspired against our royal person,"
      - "Joined with an enemy proclaimed, and from his coffers"
      - "Received the golden earnest of our death,"
      - "Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,"
      - "His princes and his peers to servitude,"
      - "His subjects to oppression and contempt,"
      - "And his whole kingdom into desolation."
      - "Touching our person, seek we no revenge,"
      - "But we our kingdom’s safety must so tender,"
      - "Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws"
      - "We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,"
      - "Poor miserable wretches, to your death,"
      - "The taste whereof God of His mercy give"
      - "You patience to endure, and true repentance"
      - "Of all your dear offences.—Bear them hence."
    m:
      - "May God in His mercy forgive you. This is your sentence. You have conspired against us with a proclaimed enemy and accepted his money in exchange for killing us. In doing so, you would have sold your king to slaughter, his princes and lords to slavery, his subjects to oppression and abuse, and his whole kingdom to ruin. I seek no revenge for myself, but so dearly do I hold the safety of my kingdom, which you sought to destroy, that you must be punished according to her laws. So go to your deaths, poor miserable wretches, the pain of which may merciful God give you the strength to endure. And may you truly regret your terrible crimes. Take them away."

      - "Shall be to you as us, like glorious."
      - "We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,"
      - "Since God so graciously hath brought to light"
      - "This dangerous treason lurking in our way"

      - "Cheerly to sea. The signs of war advance."
      - "No king of England if not king of France."
    m:
      - "And now, my lords, off to France. This invasion will be as glorious to you as it is to me. I have no doubt that it will be a swift and successful war, since God so graciously exposed this dangerous plot. I’m now sure that every bump in the road has been removed. Let’s go forth, dear countrymen. Our strength is God. Let’s get going. We’re off to sea, banners flying. I’ll be no king of England if I’m not also king of France."
