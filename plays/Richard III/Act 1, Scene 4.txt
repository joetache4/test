    o:
      - "Why looks your grace so heavily today?"
    m:
      - "Why do you look so depressed today, your Grace?"

  - sp: CLARENCE
    o:
      - "O, I have passed a miserable night,"
      - "So full of ugly dreams, of ugly sights,"
      - "That, as I am a Christian faithful man,"
      - "I would not spend another such a night"
      - "Though ’twere to buy a world of happy days,"
      - "So full of dismal terror was the time."
    m:
      - "Oh, I had a miserable night. I had such dark and terrifying dreams that I swear I wouldn’t spend another night like that if it guaranteed me a whole lifetime of happy days."

  - sp: KEEPER
    o:
      - "What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me."
    m:
      - "What was your dream? Tell me."

  - sp: CLARENCE
    o:
      - "Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower"
      - "And was embarked to cross to Burgundy,"
      - "And in my company my brother Gloucester,"
      - "Who from my cabin tempted me to walk"
      - "Upon the hatches. Thence we looked toward England"
      - "And cited up a thousand fearful times,"
      - "During the wars of York and Lancaster"
      - "That had befall’n us. As we paced along"
      - "Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,"
      - "Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling"
      - "Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard"
      - "Into the tumbling billows of the main."
      - "O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,"
      - "What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,"
      - "What sights of ugly death within my eyes."
      - "Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks,"
      - "A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon,"
      - "Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,"
      - "Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,"
      - "All scattered in the bottom of the sea."
    m:
      - "I thought I had escaped from the Tower and was on a ship to France with my brother Richard, who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him. Looking toward England, we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we’d had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters. As we were pacing the deck, which was tipping heavily, Richard seemed to stumble, and as I tried to grab hold of him and keep him from falling, he knocked me overboard into the crashing waves. Lord, how painful it was to drown. The sound of the rushing water was terrible, and so were the sights. I saw a thousand shipwrecks, a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone, huge anchors, chunks of gold, heaps of pearls, and precious jewels—all scattered on the bottom of the sea."

  - sp: CLARENCE
    o:
      - "Some lay in dead men’s skulls, and in the holes"
      - "Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept—"
      - "As ’twere in scorn of eyes—reflecting gems,"
      - "That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep"
      - "And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by."
    m:
      - "Some of the gems had wedged themselves like imitation eyes into the dead men’s skulls. The fake eyes gazed dully at the bones scattered around."

  - sp: KEEPER
    o:
      - "Had you such leisure in the time of death"
      - "To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?"
    m:
      - "So you had time as you were dying to look around?"

  - sp: CLARENCE
    o:
      - "Methought I had, and often did I strive"
      - "To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood"
      - "Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth"
      - "To find the empty, vast, and wand’ring air,"
      - "But smothered it within my panting bulk,"
      - "Who almost burst to belch it in the sea."
    m:
      - "I thought I did, and I often tried to die. But the terrible water always held me back. It wouldn’t let my soul find its way to air but smothered it inside my gasping body. My body wanted so badly to vomit up my spirit that it almost burst."

  - sp: KEEPER
    o:
      - "Awaked you not in this sore agony?"
    m:
      - "And didn’t you wake up during this terrible agony?"

  - sp: CLARENCE
    o:
      - "No, no, my dream was lengthened after life."
      - "O, then began the tempest to my soul."
      - "I passed, methought, the melancholy flood,"
      - "With that sour ferryman which poets write of,"
      - "Unto the kingdom of perpetual night."
      - "The first that there did greet my stranger-soul"
      - "Was my great father-in-law, renownèd Warwick,"
      - "Who spake aloud, “What scourge for perjury"
      - "Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?”"
      - "And so he vanished. Then came wand’ring by"
      - "A shadow like an angel, with bright hair"
      - "Dabbled in blood, and he shrieked out aloud"
    m:
      - "Oh, no, my dream went on even after I died. In fact, the real nightmare had only just begun. With the help of the grim ferryman that poets like to write about, my soul crossed the river into the kingdom of endless night. The first to greet me there was my great father-in-law, the famous earl of Warwick. He cried aloud, “What terrible punishment can this dark realm devise for the oath-breaker Clarence?” And he vanished. Then a ghost like an angel with its hair spattered in blood wandered by, and shieked,"

  - sp: CLARENCE
    o:
      - "“Clarence is come—false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,"
      - "That stabbed me in the field by Tewkesbury."
      - "Seize on him, furies. Take him unto torment.”"
      - "With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends"
      - "Environed me and howlèd in mine ears"
      - "Such hideous cries that with the very noise"
      - "I trembling waked, and for a season after"
      - "Could not believe but that I was in hell,"
      - "Such terrible impression made my dream."
    m:
      - "“Clarence has arrived—lying, cowardly Clarence, who stabbed me at Tewksbury. Grab him, avenging spirits, and torment him.” With that, a legion of ugly demons surrounded me and howled so loudly in my ears that I woke up trembling and for a long time thought I was still in hell."

  - sp: KEEPER
    o:
      - "No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you."
      - "I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it."
    m:
      - "I’m not surprised it scared you, my lord. It scares me just to hear you talk about it."

  - sp: CLARENCE
    o:
      - "Ah keeper, keeper, I have done those things,"
      - "That now give evidence against my soul,"
      - "For Edward’s sake, and see how he requites me.—"
      - "O God, if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,"
      - "But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,"
      - "Yet execute thy wrath in me alone!"
      - "O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!—"
      - "Keeper, I prithee sit by me awhile."
      - "My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep."
    m:
      - "Oh, keeper, keeper, the bad things I’ve done are finally taking their toll. I did them for Edward’s sake—and look how he rewards me.—Oh God, if my prayers don’t satisfy you, and you have to avenge the wrongs I’ve done, at least punish me alone! Please spare my innocent wife and children!—Kind warden, please stay with me for a while. I’m feeling very low, and I need to sleep."

  - sp: KEEPER
    o:

      - "Makes the night morning, and the noontide night."
      - "Princes have but their titles for their glories,"
      - "An outward honor for an inward toil,"
      - "And, for unfelt imaginations,"
      - "They often feel a world of restless cares,"
      - "So that betwixt their titles and low name"
      - "There’s nothing differs but the outward fame."
    m:
      - "Sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons. It turns everything around—the night into morning and noon into night. The only glory princes have are their titles. Instead of the pleasures we think they’re enjoying, they experience a whole world of worries. It turns out the only difference between them and peasants is their fame."

    o:
      - "What, so brief?"
    m:
      - "That’s it? Nothing to add?"

  - sp: FIRST MURDERER
    o:
      - "’Tis better, sir, to be brief than tedious.—Let him see our commission, and talk no more."

      - "There lies the duke asleep, and there the keys."
      - "*He hands them the keys*"
      - "I’ll to the king and signify to him"
      - "That thus I have resigned my charge to you."
    m:
      - "It orders me to hand the noble duke of Clarence over to you. I won’t ask why because I’d rather not know than feel guilty if you’re doing something you shouldn’t be. Here are the keys, and there is the duke, sleeping. *(he hands them the keys)* I’ll go to the king to let him know I’ve handed my prisoner over to you."

  - sp: FIRST MURDERER
    o:
      - "No. He’ll say ’twas done cowardly, when he wakes."
    m:
      - "No. When he wakes up, he’ll say we killed him like cowards."

  - sp: SECOND MURDERER
    o:
      - "Why, he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day."
    m:
      - "When he wakes up! Why, he won’t wake up till Judgment Day."

    o:
      - "Why, then he’ll say we stabbed him sleeping."

  - sp: SECOND MURDERER
    o:
      - "Nay, I prithee stay a little. I hope this passionate humor of mine will change. It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty."
    m:
      - "Please, just wait a minute. I’m hoping my holy mood will pass. It usually only lasts about twenty seconds."

  - sp: FIRST MURDERER

    m:

  - sp: FIRST MURDERER
    o:
      - "So when he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out."
    m:
      - "When he opens his wallet to give us our pay, your conscience will fly out?"

    o:
      - "’Tis no matter. Let it go. There’s few or none will entertain it."

    o:
      - "What if it come to thee again?"
    m:
      - "And what will you do if it returns to you?"

  - sp: SECOND MURDERER
    o:
      - "I’ll not meddle with it. It makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal but it accuseth him; a man cannot swear but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his neighbor’s wife but it detects him. ’Tis a blushing, shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man’s bosom. It fills a man full of obstacles. It made me once restore a purse of gold that by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it. It is turned out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing, and every man that means to live well endeavors to trust to himself and live without it."
    m:
      - "I won’t bother with it. Conscience makes a man a coward. If he steals, it accuses him. If he wants to swear, it restrains him. If he sleeps with his neighbor’s wife, it exposes him. It blushes, is easily embarrassed, and stages regular uprisings in a man’s heart. It’s just too much trouble. It once made me return a purse full of money that I found—it turns anyone who treats it decently into a beggar. It has been thrown out of all sorts of towns and cities it visits, and anyone who wants to live well should learn to trust only himself and live without it."

  - sp: FIRST MURDERER
    o:
      - "Zounds, ’tis even now at my elbow, persuading me not to kill the duke."
    m:

  - sp: SECOND MURDERER
    o:
      - "Take the devil in thy mind, and believe him not. He would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh."
    m:
      - "Stop your conscience and don’t listen to him. He wants to take over your thoughts and make you sad."

  - sp: FIRST MURDERER
    o:

    m:
      - "It’s your job in life to kill the innocent? What did I do wrong? Where’s the evidence against me? Where’s the jury, the judge, the lawful proceedings, the verdict? Who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me? For you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful. If you hope to have your sins forgiven by Christ’s dear blood, which He shed for our terrible sins, you must leave and keep your hands off me. You’ll go to Hell for the deed you’re planning to do."

      - "To hurl upon their heads that break His law."
    m:
      - "Wrong-headed slaves, the King of kings says in his Ten Commandments, “Thou shalt not murder.” Will you defy God and obey a man? Be careful. God takes revenge on those who break His laws."

He is as guilty as I am. If God will be revenged for this deed, he will do it publicly. God doesn’t need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him."
