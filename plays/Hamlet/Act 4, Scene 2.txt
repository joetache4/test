  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Safely stowed."
    m:
      - "The body is safely hidden."

  - sp: GENTLEMEN
    o:
      - "*(from within)* Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!"
    m:
      - "*(from offstage)* Hamlet, Lord Hamlet!"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "But soft, what noise? Who calls on Hamlet?"
      - "Oh, here they come."
    m:
      - "What’s that noise? Who’s calling for Hamlet? Oh, here they come."

  - os: "Enter ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others"
    ms: "ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN enter with others."

  - sp: ROSENCRANTZ
    o:
      - "What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?"
    m:
      - "What have you done with the corpse, my lord?"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin."
    m:
      - "I’ve gotten it dirty—ashes to ashes, and dust to dust."

  - sp: ROSENCRANTZ
    o:
      - "Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence"
      - "And bear it to the chapel."
    m:
      - "But tell us where it is, so we can take it to the chapel."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Do not believe it."
    m:
      - "Don’t believe it."

  - sp: ROSENCRANTZ
    o:
      - "Believe what?"
    m:
      - "Believe what?"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "That I can keep your counsel and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! What replication should be made by the son of a king?"
    m:
      - "That I’d take your advice rather than keep my own secret. Besides, you’re a sponge! What is the son of a king supposed to say to a sponge?"

  - sp: ROSENCRANTZ
    o:
      - "Take you me for a sponge, my lord?"
    m:
      - "You think I’m a sponge, my lord?"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Ay, sir, that soaks up the king’s countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry again."
    m:
      - "Yes, sir, a sponge that soaks up the king’s approval, his rewards, and his decisions. Officers like that give the king the best service in the end. He keeps them in his mouth like an ape. First he moves them around, then he swallows them. When he needs what you have found out, he can just squeeze you like a sponge and you’ll be dry again."

  - sp: ROSENCRANTZ
    o:
      - "I understand you not, my lord."
    m:
      - "I don’t follow, my lord."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear."
    m:
      - "I’m glad about that. Sly words are never understood by fools."

  - sp: ROSENCRANTZ
    o:
      - "My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king."
    m:
      - "My lord, you have to tell us where the body is, and then go with us to see the king."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body."
      - "The king is a thing—"
    m:
      - "The body’s with the king, but the king’s not with the body. The king’s a thing …"

  - sp: GUILDENSTERN
    o:
      - "A thing, my lord?"
    m:
      - "A “thing,” my lord?"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide, fox, and all after."
    m:
      - "A thing of no importance. Take me to him. Ready or not, here I come!"

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
