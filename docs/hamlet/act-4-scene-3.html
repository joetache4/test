<p>And where ’tis so, th’ offender’s scourge is weighed,</p>
<p>But never the offense. To bear all smooth and even,</p>

<b>CLAUDIUS</b>
<p>I’ve sent men to find him and retrieve the body. How dangerous to have this madman on the loose! But we can’t throw him in jail. The people love him, because they judge based on appearance rather than reason. They’ll pay attention to the severity of the punishment, not the severity of the crime. No, we must seem calm and fair-minded, and our sending him away must seem like a carefully considered move. But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment, or nothing at all.</p>
