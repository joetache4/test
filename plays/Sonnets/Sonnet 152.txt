      - "In loving thee thou know’st I am forsworn;"
      - "But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,"
      - "In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,"
      - "In vowing new hate after new love bearing."
      - "But why of two oaths’ breach do I accuse thee,"
      - "When I break twenty? I am perjured most,"
      - "For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,"
      - "And all my honest faith in thee is lost;"
      - "For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,"
      - "Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,"
      - "And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,"
      - "Or made them swear against the thing they see."
      - "  For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured eye,"
      - "  To swear against the truth so foul a lie."

      - "I know I’m breaking a promise by loving you, but you, swearing you love me, are breaking two promises: cheating on your husband by leaving his bed, then breaking your promise to your new lover by vowing to hate him. But why am I accusing you of breaking two oaths when I break twenty? I am perjured the most, because all of my vows are only made to mislead and exploit you; I’m no longer true to you. For I have sworn great oaths about how kind you are, oaths about your love, your faithfulness, your constancy. And to make you look better I blinded myself, swearing to the opposite of what I actually saw. For I have sworn that you are beautiful; my eye is doubly a liar, offering such a foul lie after swearing to tell the truth."
