<p>I could not stay behind you. My desire,</p>
<p>More sharp than filèd steel, did spur me forth.</p>
<p>And not all love to see you, though so much</p>
<p>As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,</p>
<p>But jealousy what might befall your travel,</p>
<p>Being skilless in these parts, which to a stranger,</p>
<p>Unguided and unfriended, often prove</p>
<p>Rough and unhospitable. My willing love,</p>
<p>The rather by these arguments of fear,</p>
<p>Set forth in your pursuit.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ANTONIO</b>
<p>I couldn’t stay behind after you left. I just felt a sharp desire to follow you. It wasn’t just that I wanted to see you, though I very much did want that. I was also worried about what might happen to you while you were traveling, since you’re not familiar with this area, and it’s rough and unwelcoming to a stranger with no guide. I followed you because I love you and I was worried about you.</p>

<p>My kind Antonio,</p>
<p>I can no other answer make but thanks,</p>
<p>And thanks, and ever thanks. And oft good turns</p>
<p>Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay.</p>
<p>But were my worth as is my conscience, firm,</p>
<p>You should find better dealing. What’s to do?</p>
<p>Shall we go see the relics of this town?</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>SEBASTIAN</b>
<p>My friend Antonio, all I can say is thank you. I know words are cheap. If I had any money I’d back up my gratitude with cash. Anyway, what should we do? Should we go see the sights in the town?</p>

<p>Would you’d pardon me;</p>
<p>I do not without danger walk these streets:</p>
<p>Once in a sea-fight ’gainst the Count his galleys</p>
<p>I did some service, of such note indeed,</p>
<p>That were I ta’en here it would scarce be answered.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ANTONIO</b>
<p>I’m sorry, but I can’t. You see, it’s dangerous for me to walk in these streets. Once in a battle at sea I did a lot of damage to Count Orsino’s warships. If they arrested me here, it’d be the end of me.</p>

<b>ANTONIO</b>
<p>The offence is not of such a bloody nature;</p>
<p>Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel</p>
<p>Might well have given us bloody argument.</p>
<p>It might have since been answered in repaying</p>
<p>What we took from them, which, for traffic’s sake,</p>
<p>Most of our city did. Only myself stood out;</p>
<p>For which, if I be lapsèd in this place,</p>
<p>I shall pay dear.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ANTONIO</b>
<p>No, I didn’t do anything as violent as that, though we would’ve been justified in shedding a little blood over the matter. The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them—which most of our city did, for the sake of friendly trade relations. I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole. That’s why I’ll pay dearly if they find me here.</p>

<p>You’re right. Hang on a minute, here’s some money for you. <em>(he gives SEBASTIAN money)</em> The best place to stay around here is an inn called the Elephant, in the suburbs south of the city. I’ll arrange for our meals while you enjoy yourself and educate yourself by looking at the town. You’ll find me at the Elephant.</p>
