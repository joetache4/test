  - os: "Storm still Enter KENT disguised and GENTLEMAN, severally"
    ms: "The storm continues to rage. KENT enters in disguise. The GENTLEMAN enters from a different direction."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Who’s there, besides foul weather?"
    m:
      - "Who’s there, aside from this foul weather?"

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "One minded like the weather, most unquietly."
    m:
      - "Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather, very troubled."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "I know you. Where’s the king?"
    m:
      - "I know you. Where’s the king?"

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "Contending with the fretful elements."
      - "Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea"
      - "Or swell the curlèd water ’bove the main,"
      - "That things might change or cease. Tears his white hair,"
      - "Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,"
      - "Catch in their fury and make nothing of."
      - "Strives in his little world of man to outscorn"
      - "The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain."
      - "This night—wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,"
      - "The lion and the belly-pinchèd wolf"
      - "Keep their fur dry—unbonneted he runs,"
      - "And bids what will take all."
    m:
      - "Struggling with the wind and rain. He’s shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea, or make the sea flood the earth—he wants to see the world return to primal chaos. He keeps tearing out his white hair, which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness. Small but brave in his surroundings, he’s trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth. He’s running bareheaded, calling for the end of the world, out there on a night like this, when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "  But who is with him?"
    m:
      - "But who’s with him?"

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "None but the fool, who labors to outjest"
      - "His heart-struck injuries."
    m:
      - "Nobody but the fool, who’s trying to soothe the wounds in the king’s heart with jokes."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "  Sir, I do know you,"
      - "And dare upon the warrant of my note"
      - "Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,"
      - "Although as yet the face of it be covered"
      - "With mutual cunning, ’twixt Albany and Cornwall,"
      - "Who have—as who have not that their great stars"
      - "Throned and set high?—servants, who seem no less,"
      - "Which are to France the spies and speculations"
      - "Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,"
      - "Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,"
      - "Or the hard rein which both of them hath borne"
      - "Against the old kind king, or something deeper,"
      - "Whereof perchance these are but furnishings—"
      - "But true it is. From France there comes a power"
      - "Into this scattered kingdom, who already,"
      - "Wise in our negligence, have secret feet"
      - "In some of our best ports and are at point"
      - "To show their open banner. Now to you."
      - "If on my credit you dare build so far"
      - "To make your speed to Dover, you shall find"
      - "Some that will thank you, making just report"
      - "Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow"
      - "The king hath cause to plain."
      - "I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,"
      - "And from some knowledge and assurance offer"
      - "This office to you."
    m:
      - "Sir, I know you, and I trust you enough to share something very important with you. There’s a feud between Albany and Cornwall, although they’ve been clever enough to hide it thus far. Like other powerful rulers, they have servants who are actually French spies in disguise. These spies have noticed something, perhaps in the squabbles between Albany and Cornwall, or in the tough line both of them have taken against the good old king, or perhaps in some deeper matter at the root of both of these problems—The point is that the King of France has sent troops into our divided kingdom. Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war. Now this is where you come in. If you trust me enough to hurry to Dover, you’ll earn the gratitude of many people when you fairly report the monstrous and maddening extent of the king’s suffering. I’m a nobleman, and I know what I’m doing in assigning this job to you."

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "I will talk further with you."
    m:
      - "Let’s discuss it some more."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "*(giving GENTLEMAN a purse and a ring)*"
      - "    No, do not."
      - "For confirmation that I am much more"
      - "Than my outwall, open this purse and take"
      - "What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia—"
      - "As fear not but you shall—show her this ring."
      - "And she will tell you who that fellow is"
      - "That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!"
      - "I will go seek the king."
    m:
      - "*(giving the GENTLEMAN a purse and a ring)* No, there’s no need. To assure you that I am a nobleman in disguise, here is some money. If you see Cordelia—as I’m sure you will—show her this ring. She’ll tell you who I am. Damn this storm! I’ll go find the king."

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?"
    m:
      - "Let me shake your hand. Do you have anything else to tell me?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Few words, but to effect more than all yet:"
      - "That when we have found the king—in which your pain"
      - "That way; I’ll this—he that first lights on him"
      - "Holla the other."
    m:
      - "Only a few more words, but they’re the most important. Let me go this way, and you go that way. When one of us finds the king, he’ll call out to the other one."

  - os: "Exeunt severally"
    ms: "They exit in opposite directions."
