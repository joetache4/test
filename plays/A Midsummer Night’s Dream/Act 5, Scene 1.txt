  - os: "Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, and PHILOSTRATE, with other attendant lords"
    ms: "THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, and PHILOSTRATE enter, with a number of lords and servants."

  - sp: HIPPOLYTA
    o:
      - "’Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of."
    m:
      - "These lovers are saying some strange things, Theseus."

  - sp: THESEUS
    o:
      - "More strange than true. I never may believe"
      - "These antique fables nor these fairy toys."
      - "Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,"
      - "Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend"
      - "More than cool reason ever comprehends."
      - "The lunatic, the lover, and the poet"
      - "Are of imagination all compact."
      - "One sees more devils than vast hell can hold—"
      - "That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,"
      - "Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt."
      - "The poet’s eye, in fine frenzy rolling,"
      - "Doth glance from heaven to Earth, from Earth to heaven."
      - "And as imagination bodies forth"
      - "The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen"
      - "Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing"
      - "A local habitation and a name."
      - "Such tricks hath strong imagination,"
      - "That if it would but apprehend some joy,"
      - "It comprehends some bringer of that joy."
      - "Or in the night, imagining some fear,"
      - "How easy is a bush supposed a bear!"
    m:
      - "Yes, strange—and totally made up too. I’ll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales. Lovers and madmen hallucinate about things that sane people just can’t understand. Lunatics, lovers, and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations. some people think they see devils and monsters everywhere—and they’re lunatics. Lovers are just as crazy, and think a dark-skinned gypsy is the most gorgeous woman in the world. Poets are always looking around like they’re having a fit, confusing the mundane with the otherworldly, and describing things in their writing that simply don’t exist. All these people have such strong imaginations that, when they feel happy, they assume a god or some other supernatural being is bringing that happiness to them. Or if they’re afraid of something at night, they look at the shrubbery and imagine it’s a wild bear!"

  - sp: HIPPOLYTA
    o:
      - "But all the story of the night told over,"
      - "And all their minds transfigured so together,"
      - "More witnesseth than fancy’s images"
      - "And grows to something of great constancy,"
      - "But, howsoever, strange and admirable."
    m:
      - "But the story that these lovers are telling, and the fact that they all saw and heard exactly the same things, make me think there’s more going on here than imaginary fantasies. Their story is bizarre and astounding, but it’s solid and consistent."

  - os: "Enter lovers: LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA"
    ms: "The lovers—LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA—enter."

  - sp: THESEUS
    o:
      - "Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.—"
      - "Joy, gentle friends! Joy and fresh days of love"
      - "Accompany your hearts!"
    m:
      - "Here come the lovers, laughing happily.—I wish you joy, my friends! I hope the days ahead are full of joy for you."

  - sp: LYSANDER
    o:
      - "    More than to us"
      - "Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!"
    m:
      - "We wish you even more joy, and hope joy comes to you in your royal walks, at your table, and in your royal bed!"

  - sp: THESEUS
    o:
      - "Come now, what masques, what dances shall we have"
      - "To wear away this long age of three hours"
      - "Between our after-supper and bedtime?"
      - "Where is our usual manager of mirth?"
      - "What revels are in hand? Is there no play,"
      - "To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?"
      - "Call Philostrate."
    m:
      - "Now, what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime? Where is our entertainment director? What performances have been prepared? Aren’t there any plays for us to enjoy while we wait in torture for bedtime to come? Let me see Philostrate."

  - sp: PHILOSTRATE
    o:
      - "  Here, mighty Theseus."
    m:
      - "Here I am, Theseus."

  - sp: THESEUS
    o:
      - "Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?"
      - "What masque, what music? How shall we beguile"
      - "The lazy time if not with some delight?"
    m:
      - "Tell us what entertainment you’ve prepared for the evening. Which plays, what music? How will we pass the time without some entertainment?"

  - sp: PHILOSTRATE
    o:
      - "*(giving THESEUS a document)*"
      - "There is a brief, how many sports are ripe."
      - "Make choice of which your highness will see first."
    m:
      - "*(giving THESEUS a piece of paper)* Here’s a list of all of the acts that have been prepared. Choose which one you want to see first."

  - sp: THESEUS
    o:
      - "*(reads)*"
      - "“The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung"
      - "  By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.”"
      - "We’ll none of that. That have I told my love,"
      - "In glory of my kinsman Hercules."
      - "“The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,"
      - "  Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.”"
      - "That is an old device, and it was played"
      - "When I from Thebes came last a conqueror."
      - "“The thrice three Muses mourning for the death"
      - "  Of learning, late deceased in beggary.”"
      - "That is some satire, keen and critical,"
      - "Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony."
      - "“A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus"
      - "  And his love Thisbe. Very tragical mirth.”"
      - "“Merry” and “tragical”? “Tedious” and “brief”?"
      - "That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow."
      - "How shall we find the concord of this discord?"
    m:
      - "*(reading)* “The battle between Hercules and the Centaurs, to be sung by an Athenian eunuch, accompanied by a harp.” No, we won’t see that. I’ve already told that story to Hippolyta, while praising my cousin Hercules. What else? “The riot of the drunk Bacchanals who rip the singer Orpheus to shreds.” That’s an old show, and I saw it the last time I came back from conquering Thebes. “The nine Muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship.” That’s some sharp, critical satire, and it’s not appropriate for a wedding. “A tedious short drama about young Pyramus and his love Thisbe, a very sad and tragic comedy.” A sad comedy? Short but still tedious? That’s like hot ice and strange snow. How can this drama be so many contradictory things?"

  - sp: PHILOSTRATE
    o:
      - "A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,"
      - "Which is as brief as I have known a play."
      - "But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,"
      - "Which makes it tedious. For in all the play"
      - "There is not one word apt, one player fitted."
      - "And tragical, my noble lord, it is."
      - "For Pyramus therein doth kill himself."
      - "Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,"
      - "Made mine eyes water—but more merry tears"
      - "The passion of loud laughter never shed."
    m:
      - "It’s a play about ten words long, which is the shortest play I’ve ever heard of. But in my opinion, it’s about ten words too long. That’s why it’s tedious. In the entire play, not one word is well-written, and not one of the actors is right for his part. It’s tragic because Pyramus kills himself. I have to admit that when I saw his suicide during rehearsal, I had tears in my eyes—but they were tears of laughter."

  - sp: THESEUS
    o:
      - "What are they that do play it?"
    m:
      - "Who are the actors?"

  - sp: PHILOSTRATE
    o:
      - "Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,"
      - "Which never labored in their minds till now,"
      - "And now have toiled their unbreathed memories"
      - "With this same play against your nuptial."
    m:
      - "Rough workmen from Athens who never spent much time thinking. Now they’ve worn out their out-of-shape brains to put on this play for your wedding."

  - sp: THESEUS
    o:
      - "And we will hear it."
    m:
      - "So let’s see it."

  - sp: PHILOSTRATE
    o:
      - "  No, my noble lord."
      - "It is not for you. I have heard it over,"
      - "And it is nothing, nothing in the world—"
      - "Unless you can find sport in their intents,"
      - "Extremely stretched and conned with cru ’l pain"
      - "To do you service."
    m:
      - "No, my noble lord. This play isn’t right for you. I’ve seen the whole thing, and it’s completely worthless—unless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lines—which they memorized so painfully—are funny."

  - sp: THESEUS
    o:
      - "  I will hear that play."
      - "For never anything can be amiss"
      - "When simpleness and duty tender it."
      - "Go, bring them in.—And take your places, ladies."
    m:
      - "I’ll watch this play. Nothing can really be bad when it’s created by simple people who try hard. Come on, bring them in. And sit down, ladies."

  - os: "Exit PHILOSTRATE"
    ms: "PHILOSTRATE exits."

  - sp: HIPPOLYTA
    o:
      - "I love not to see wretchedness o’er charged"
      - "And duty in his service perishing."
    m:
      - "I don’t like seeing poor people overburdened or looking bad when they’re trying to do something good."

  - sp: THESEUS
    o:
      - "Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing."
    m:
      - "You won’t see anything like that, sweetheart."

  - sp: HIPPOLYTA
    o:
      - "He says they can do nothing in this kind."
    m:
      - "He just said that they’re no good at acting."

  - sp: THESEUS
    o:
      - "The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing."
      - "Our sport shall be to take what they mistake."
      - "And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect"
      - "Takes it in might, not merit."
      - "Where I have come, great clerks have purposèd"
      - "To greet me with premeditated welcomes,"
      - "Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,"
      - "Make periods in the midst of sentences,"
      - "Throttle their practiced accent in their fears,"
      - "And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,"
      - "Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,"
      - "Out of this silence yet I picked a welcome,"
      - "And in the modesty of fearful duty"
      - "I read as much as from the rattling tongue"
      - "Of saucy and audacious eloquence."
      - "Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity"
      - "In least speak most, to my capacity."
    m:
      - "Then we’re even kinder people for thanking them for something that they’re not good at. We’ll entertain ourselves by accepting their mistakes. When poor dutiful people can’t do certain things well, generous people can consider the effort they put into it rather than the effect that they produce. In my travels, great scholars have come up to me, meaning to greet me with well-rehearsed welcoming speeches, and I have seen them tremble and turn pale, and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences, and botch their well-rehearsed tones of voice because they’re so nervous, and then break off abruptly at the end, without actually welcoming me. Trust me, my sweet, I figured out that they were trying to welcome me even though they were silent, and that message was as clear from someone who was modest and nervously dutiful as it is from someone who is loud and audacious and eloquent. Therefore, love and tongue-tied simplicity can say the most even when they’re saying the least, in my opinion."

      - "You shall know all that you are like to know."
    m:
      - "If we happen to offend you, it’s because we want to. We don’t want you to think we came here to offend you, except that we want to offend you with our good intentions. Our plan to show off our little bit of talent will wind up getting us executed. Please keep in mind we’re only here out of spite. We don’t come here with the intention of making you happy. We’re absolutely not here to delight you. The actors are ready to come out and make you sorry. By watching their show, you’ll find out everything you’re likely to know."

    m:
      - "He rode that prologue like a wild horse. He didn’t know how to stop it. The moral of this story is that it’s not enough to speak; you have to speak grammatically."

  - sp: HIPPOLYTA
    o:
      - "Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder—a sound, but not in government."

      - "This grisly beast, which “Lion” hight by name,"
      - "The trusty Thisbe, coming first by night,"

      - "At large discourse, while here they do remain."
    m:
      - "*(delivered by QUINCE)* Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps you are wondering what is going on. Well, keep wondering, until the truth makes everything clear. This man is Pyramus, if you want to know. This beautiful lady is definitely Thisbe. This man with the limestone and cement is portraying Wall, that horrible wall that kept these lovers apart. They are content to whisper through Wall’s little hole, the poor souls, and no one should be surprised. This man, with his lantern, dog, and thornbush, portrays Moonshine, because, if you want to know, the lovers were not ashamed to meet each other by moonshine at Ninus’ tomb in order to carry on their courtship. This grisly beast, which is called “Lion,” scared away, or rather frightened, the faithful Thisbe when she arrived at the meeting place at night. As she ran away from him, she dropped her cloak, which the horrible Lion stained with his bloody mouth. Soon Pyramus comes along, a tall and handsome young man, and finds his faithful Thisbe’s cloak to be dead. At this point, he takes his sword, his bloody blameful blade, and bravely breaks open his boiling bloody breast. And Thisbe, hiding in the shade of the mulberry bushes, took his dagger and killed herself. For the rest of the story, let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and the two lovers talk more about it, since they’re standing here."

  - sp: THESEUS

      - "And such a wall, as I would have you think,"
      - "That had in it a crannied hole, or chink,"
      - "Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,"
      - "Did whisper often very secretly."
      - "This loam, this roughcast, and this stone doth show"
      - "That I am that same wall. The truth is so."

      - "Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper."
    m:
      - "*(played by SNOUT)* At this point I, Snout, play a wall. But not just any wall. I want you to understand that I’m pretending to be a kind of wall that has a little hole in it. The lovers Pyramus and Thisbe often whispered very secretly through that hole. This clay, this cement, and this stone that I’m carrying around show that I’m that wall. It’s the truth. And this is the crack, right side and left side *(points with two fingers)*, through which the frightened lovers will be whispering."

      - "If we actors have offended you, just think of it this way and everything will be all right—you were asleep when you saw these visions, and this silly and pathetic story was no more real than a dream. Ladies and gentlemen, don’t get upset with me. If you forgive us, we’ll make everything all right. I’m an honest Puck, and I swear that if we’re lucky enough not to get hissed at, we’ll make it up to you soon. If not, then I’m a liar. So good night to everyone. Give me some applause, if we’re friends, and Robin will make everything up to you."
