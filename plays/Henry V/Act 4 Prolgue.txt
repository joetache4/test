    o:
      - "Now entertain conjecture of a time"
      - "When creeping murmur and the poring dark"
      - "Fills the wide vessel of the universe."
      - "From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night,"
      - "The hum of either army stilly sounds,"
      - "That the fixed sentinels almost receive"
      - "The secret whispers of each other’s watch."
      - "Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames"
      - "Each battle sees the other’s umbered face."
      - "Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs"
      - "Piercing the night’s dull ear; and from the tents"
      - "The armorers, accomplishing the knights,"
      - "With busy hammers closing rivets up,"
      - "Give dreadful note of preparation."
      - "The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,"
      - "And, the third hour of drowsy morning named,"
      - "Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,"
      - "The confident and overlusty French"
      - "Do the low-rated English play at dice"
      - "And chide the cripple, tardy-gaited night,"
      - "Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp"
      - "So tediously away. The poor condemnèd English,"
      - "Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires"
      - "Sit patiently and inly ruminate"
      - "The morning’s danger; and their gesture sad,"
      - "Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats,"
      - "Presenteth them unto the gazing moon"
      - "So many horrid ghosts. Oh, now, who will behold"
      - "The royal captain of this ruined band"
      - "Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent?"
      - "Let him cry, “Praise and glory on his head!”"
      - "For forth he goes and visits all his host,"
      - "Bids them good morrow with a modest smile,"
      - "And calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen."
      - "Upon his royal face there is no note"
      - "How dread an army hath enrounded him,"
      - "Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color"
      - "Unto the weary and all-watchèd night,"
      - "But freshly looks and overbears attaint"
      - "With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty,"
      - "That every wretch, pining and pale before,"
      - "Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks."
      - "A largess universal, like the sun,"
      - "His liberal eye doth give to everyone,"
      - "Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all"
      - "Behold, as may unworthiness define,"
      - "A little touch of Harry in the night."
      - "And so our scene must to the battle fly,"
      - "Where, Oh, for pity, we shall much disgrace,"
      - "With four or five most vile and ragged foils"
      - "Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,"
      - "The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,"
      - "Minding true things by what their mock’ries be."
    m:
      - "Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe. From camp to camp through the dark cave of night, the noise from both armies grows so quiet that those standing watch almost think they can hear the whispered secrets of one another’s sentinels. One by one, fires are lit on both sides, and through their pale flames, each army thinks he sees the smoke-tinged faces of the other. The horses of each army answer one another’s proud, threatening neighs as they pierce the dull night, and from the tents the sound of the blacksmiths’ hammers as they fit out the knights, closing rivets up, adds a note of fear to the preparations. The country cocks crow and the clocks toll, sounding a drowsy three o’clock in the morning. Proud of their army and secure in their numbers, the confident and overeager French play dice, betting on how many worthless Englishmen each will capture. They scold the limping, slowly moving night, which, like an ugly old woman, takes so long to pass. The poor doomed English, like sacrificial beasts, sit patiently, and privately contemplate the dangers that will arrive with morning. With their grave faces, emaciated cheeks, and war-torn coats, they seem to the gazing moon like so many horrifying ghosts. Now, whoever spots the royal captain of this ruined army walking from camp to camp, from tent to tent, let him cry “Praise and glory on his head!” For out he goes visiting all his troops. He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen. There is no indication of the mighty army that surrounds them in his expression, nor has the long, sleepless night robbed his face of an ounce of color. Instead, he looks fresh and covers any signs of fatigue with a show of cheerfulness and sweet majesty that every sad and pale wretch takes comfort in when they see him. His generous eye notices everyone, doling out a bounty as far-reaching as the sun, thawing cold fear, so that low and well-born alike may all experience (for want of a better way of putting it) a little touch of Harry in the night. With that, our scene rushes on toward the battle, which we will represent with four or five worn-out fencing foils, a travesty of battle—forgive us!—that disgraces the name of Agincourt. Still, stay to watch, imagining the way it really was from our own inadequate imitation."
