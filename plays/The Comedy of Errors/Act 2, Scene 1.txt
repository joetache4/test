  - os: "Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA"
    ms: "ADRIANA and LUCIANA enter."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Neither my husband nor the slave returned"
      - "That in such haste I sent to seek his master?"
      - "Sure, Luciana, it is two o’clock."
    m:
      - "Neither my husband nor the slave has returned, even though I sent the slave off running. Surely, Luciana, it’s already two o’clock."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,"
      - "And from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner."
      - "Good sister, let us dine and never fret."
      - "A man is master of his liberty;"
      - "Time is their master, and when they see time"
      - "They’ll go or come. If so, be patient, sister."
    m:
      - "Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch. Sister, let’s eat and stop worrying. A man is master of his own freedom: time is his only master, and when the right moment comes along, he’ll come or go as he pleases. If this is so, be patient, sister."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Why should their liberty than ours be more?"
    m:
      - "Why should men be more free than women?"

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Because their business still lies out o’ door."
    m:
      - "Because their business lies outside the home."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill."
    m:
      - "Listen, when I behave this way toward him, he hates it."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "O, know he is the bridle of your will."
    m:
      - "Oh, you should know that he’s the bridle to your will."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "There’s none but asses will be bridled so."
    m:
      - "Only a mule would agree to that."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Why, headstrong liberty is lashed with woe."
      - "There’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye"
      - "But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky."
      - "The beasts, the fishes, and the wingèd fowls"
      - "Are their males’ subjects and at their controls."
      - "Man, more divine, the masters of all these,"
      - "Lord of the wide world and wild wat’ry seas,"
      - "Endued with intellectual sense and souls,"
      - "Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,"
      - "Are masters to their females, and their lords."
      - "Then let your will attend on their accords."
    m:
      - "Why, too much freedom leads to woe. There’s nothing under heaven that doesn’t have its limits. The beasts on the earth, the fish in the sea, and the birds in the sky are all subject to the males of their species and under their control. Men, who are nearest to God, are the masters of all these creatures. And men—the lords of the wide world and the wild watery seas, gifted with intellectual sense and souls, greater than the fish and the birds—are the masters of women and their lords. Therefore, you should obey their wishes."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "This servitude makes you to keep unwed."
    m:
      - "It’s this servantlike mentality that’s keeping you unmarried."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Not this, but troubles of the marriage bed."
    m:
      - "No, that’s not it—it’s because of what happens in the marriage bed."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway."
    m:
      - "But if you were married, you’d wield some influence."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Ere I learn love, I’ll practice to obey."
    m:
      - "Before I learn how to love, I’ll learn how to follow orders."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "How if your husband start some otherwhere?"
    m:
      - "What if your husband strays elsewhere?"

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Till he come home again, I would forbear."
    m:
      - "I’d endure it until he came home again."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Patience unmoved! No marvel though she pause;"
      - "They can be meek that have no other cause."
      - "A wretched soul, bruised with adversity"
      - "We bid be quiet when we hear it cry,"
      - "But were we burdened with like weight of pain,"
      - "As much or more we should ourselves complain."
      - "So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,"
      - "With urging helpless patience would relieve me;"
      - "But, if thou live to see like right bereft,"
      - "This fool-begged patience in thee will be left."
    m:
      - "Now that’s patience! No wonder she’s waiting to get married. It’s easy to preach meekness when you have no reason to act otherwise. When we’re faced with a wretched person, bruised and crying with hardship, we try to get them to shush up. And yet, if we were suffering the same kind of pain, we’d complain just as much—if not more! So you, who have no husband causing you problems, want to comfort me by preaching the virtue of feeble patience. But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights, this foolish patience will abandon you."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Well, I will marry one day, but to try."
      - "Here comes your man. Now is your husband nigh."
    m:
      - "Well, I’ll get married one day, just to see. Here comes your servant—your husband must be coming soon."

  - os: "Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS"
    ms: "DROMIO OF EPHESUS enters."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Say, is your tardy master now at hand?"
    m:
      - "Tell me, is your tardy master close at hand?"

  - sp: DROMIO OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Nay, he’s at two hands with me, and that my two ears can witness."
    m:
      - "No; but he came at me with two hands—just ask my ears."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Say, didst thou speak with him? Know’st thou his mind?"
    m:
      - "Did you talk to him? Do you know his plans?"

  - sp: DROMIO OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear."
      - "Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it."
    m:
      - "Yes, yes, he told me his plans on my ears. Damn his hands—I could barely understand it."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning?"
    m:
      - "Did he speak so ambiguously that you couldn’t get a feeling for what he meant?"

  - sp: DROMIO OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Nay, he struck so plainly I could too well feel his blows, and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand them."
    m:
      - "No; he hit me very clearly and I felt his punches perfectly well. They were so dreadful, I could barely stand up under them."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "But say, I prithee, is he coming home?"
      - "It seems he hath great care to please his wife."
    m:
      - "But please, tell me: is he coming home? It seems he has taken great care to please his wife."

  - sp: DROMIO OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Why, mistress, sure my master is horn mad."
    m:
      - "Why, mistress, my master is as angry as a bull with horns."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Horn mad, thou villain!"
    m:
      - "Horns? You bastard!"

  - sp: DROMIO OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "    I mean not cuckold mad,"
      - "But sure he is stark mad."
      - "When I desired him to come home to dinner,"
      - "He asked me for a thousand marks in gold."
      - "“’Tis dinnertime,” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he."
      - "“Your meat doth burn,” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he."
      - "“Will you come?” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he."
      - "“Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?”"
      - "“The pig,” quoth I, “is burned.” “My gold,” quoth he."
      - "“My mistress, sir,” quoth I. “Hang up thy mistress!"
      - "I know not thy mistress. Out on thy mistress!”"
    m:
      - "I don’t mean he’s cuckold mad. But he sure is angry. When I asked him to come home to lunch, he asked me for a thousand marks. “It’s lunchtime,” I said. “My gold,” he said. “The meat’s burning,” I said. “My gold,” he said. “Will you come home?” I said. “My gold,” he said. “Where’s the thousand marks I gave you, scoundrel?” “The pig,” I said, “is burned.” “My gold,” he said. “My mistress,” I said. “Damn your mistress! I don’t know your mistress, the hell with your mistress!”"

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Quoth who?"
    m:
      - "Who said that?"

  - sp: DROMIO OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Quoth my master."
      - "“I know,” quoth he, “no house, no wife, no mistress.”"
      - "So that my errand, due unto my tongue,"
      - "I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders,"
      - "For, in conclusion, he did beat me there."
    m:
      - "My master said it. “I don’t know,” he said, “any house, wife, or mistress.” My message, which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth, ended up being carried back home by my shoulders. Because at the end of it all, that’s where he beat me."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home."
    m:
      - "Go back again, slave, and bring him home."

  - sp: DROMIO OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Go back again and be new beaten home?"
      - "For God’s sake, send some other messenger."
    m:
      - "Go back again, to be beaten home again? For God’s sake, send somebody else."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across."
    m:
      - "Go back, slave, or I’ll knock you one across the head."

  - sp: DROMIO OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "And he will bless that cross with other beating."
      - "Between you, I shall have a holy head."
    m:
      - "And he’ll add another knock across. With all these crosses, I’ll have a holy head."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home."
    m:
      - "Get out of here, you blathering peasant! Bring your master home."

  - sp: DROMIO OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Am I so round with you as you with me,"
      - "That like a football you do spurn me thus?"
      - "You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither."
      - "If I last in this service, you must case me in leather."
    m:
      - "Do I treat you this roundly? You’re kicking me around like I’m a football. You kick me out, he kicks me back. If I keep working for you, I’m going to end up wrapped in leather, like a football."

  - os: "Exit DROMIO OF EPHESUS"
    ms: "DROMIO OF EPHESUS exits."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Fie, how impatience loureth in your face."
    m:
      - "Look at you! You have impatience all over your face."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "His company must do his minions grace,"
      - "Whilst I at home starve for a merry look."
      - "Hath homely age th’ alluring beauty took"
      - "From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it."
      - "Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?"
      - "If voluble and sharp discourse be marred,"
      - "Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard."
      - "Do their gay vestments his affections bait?"
      - "That’s not my fault; he’s master of my state."
      - "What ruins are in me that can be found"
      - "By him not ruined? Then is he the ground"
      - "Of my defeatures. My decayèd fair"
      - "A sunny look of his would soon repair."
      - "But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale"
      - "And feeds from home. Poor I am but his stale."
    m:
      - "He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him. Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks? That’s because he has squandered my beauty. Am I boring? Have I lost my wit? If my conversation is no longer free and clever, that’s because he’s dulled it—I’m like a sharp tool he’s blunted with a hard piece of marble. Is he charmed by their pretty clothes? Well, that’s not my fault—he’s the one in charge of my spending. What faults can you find in me that weren’t first caused by him? One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty. But like an unruly deer, he’s always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures. I am nothing but a poor, used fool."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "Self-harming jealousy, fie, beat it hence."
    m:
      - "This jealousy is harming only you! Drive it out of you."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense."
      - "I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,"
      - "Or else what lets it but he would be here?"
      - "Sister, you know he promised me a chain."
      - "Would that alone o’ love he would detain,"
      - "So he would keep fair quarter with his bed."
      - "I see the jewel best enamelèd"
      - "Will lose his beauty. Yet the gold bides still"
      - "That others touch, and often touching will"
      - "Wear gold; yet no man that hath a name"
      - "By falsehood and corruption doth it shame."
      - "Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,"
      - "I’ll weep what’s left away, and weeping die."
    m:
      - "Only someone who doesn’t feel this pain could tell me to ignore it. I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman, or why wouldn’t he be here? Sister, you know he promised to give me a necklace. I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me. Even the best jewel can be tarnished. Gold, however, can’t be corrupted—though it can be worn down if it’s touched too often. And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior. Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband, I’ll weep away what’s left and then die with weeping."

  - sp: LUCIANA
    o:
      - "How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!"
    m:
      - "How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy!"

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
