<p>So are you to my thoughts as food to life,</p>
<p>Or as sweet seasoned show’rs are to the ground;</p>
<p>And for the peace of you I hold such strife</p>
<p>As ’twixt a miser and his wealth is found;</p>
<p>Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon</p>
<p>Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;</p>
<p>Now counting best to be with you alone,</p>
<p>Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure;</p>
<p>Sometime all full with feasting on your sight</p>
<p>And by and by clean starvèd for a look;</p>
<p>Possessing or pursuing no delight,</p>
<p>Save what is had or must from you be took.</p>
<p>Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,</p>
<p>Or gluttoning on all, or all away.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<p>I need you the way living things need food or the grass needs rain, and to attain the peace that only you can give me, I fight with myself the way a miser struggles with his wealth. One moment he enjoys his wealth proudly, and the next he’s worried that someone from these thieving times will steal his treasure. One moment I think it’s best to be alone with you, but then I think it would be better if the rest of the world could see my pleasure. At times I feel oversatisfied from looking at you excessively, but a little later I’m starving to get a look at you. I can’t experience or pursue any enjoyment except what you can give me or I can take from you. That’s why I suffer and feel hungry day after day, because I either get too much of you or none at all.</p>
