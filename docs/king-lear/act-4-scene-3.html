<p>Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,</p>

<p>Yes, sir. She took the letters and read them in front of me. Now and then a large tear trickled down her delicate cheek. She seemed to be trying to control her emotions, which were overwhelming her.</p>

<p>Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove</p>
<p>Who should express her goodliest. You have seen</p>
<p>Sunshine and rain at once—her smiles and tears</p>
<p>Were like a better way. Those happy smilets</p>
<p>That played on her ripe lip seemed not to know</p>
<p>What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence</p>
<p>As pearls from diamonds dropped. In brief,</p>
<p>Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved</p>
<p>If all could so become it.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>GENTLEMAN</b>
<p>There were no outbursts. She was struggling between emotion and self-control. You’ve seen how it can rain while the sun shines? That’s how she was, smiling and crying at once, only more lovely. The little smile on her full lips didn’t seem aware of the tears that were dropping like diamonds from her pearly eyes. If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow, then sorrow would be highly prized.</p>

<p>Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of “father”</p>
<p>Pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart,</p>
<p>Cried, “Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies, sisters!</p>
<p>Kent, father, sisters! What, i’ th’ storm, i’ th’ night?</p>
<p>Let pity not be believed.” There she shook</p>
<p>The holy water from her heavenly eyes,</p>
<p>And clamor moistened. Then away she started</p>
<p>To deal with grief alone.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>GENTLEMAN</b>
<p>Actually, once or twice she sighed and said, “father,” as if the word were pressing on her chest. Once she exclaimed, “Sisters, sisters, shame on you! Kent, father, sisters! What, out in a storm in the middle of the night? I can’t believe it.” The tears fell from her eyes like holy water. Then she ran away to grieve alone.</p>

<p>A sovereign shame so elbows him. His own unkindness</p>

<p>He’s too overwhelmed with shame. He remembers how unkind he was to her, how he disowned her and sent her abroad, how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters. All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia.</p>
