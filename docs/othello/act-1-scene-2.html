<p>That the Magnifico is much beloved</p>
<p>And hath in his effect a voice potential</p>
<p>As double as the Duke’s. He will divorce you,</p>

<p>Let him do his worst. The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will. No one knows this yet—and I don’t like to brag, but I come from a royal family, and I’m as noble as the woman I’ve married. And let me tell you, Iago, if I didn’t love Desdemona as much as I do, I’d never agree to get married and lose my freedom at all. But look at those lights. Who’s coming?</p>

You’re something to fear, not to love. It’s obvious to everyone that you’ve tricked her, drugged her, or kidnapped her.
