    m:
      - "A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them. “Give me one,” I said. “Get away from me, witch!” the fat woman cried. Her husband has sailed off to Aleppo as master of a ship called the *Tiger*. I’ll sail there in a kitchen strainer, turn myself into a tailless rat, and do things to him—"

He won’t catch a wink of sleep, either at night or during the day. He will live as a cursed man. For eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony. Although I can’t make his ship disappear, I can still make his journey miserable. Look what I have here."

They don’t look like they belong on this planet, but I see them standing here on Earth. *(to the WITCHES)* Are you alive? Can you answer questions? You seem to understand me, because each of you has put a gruesome finger to her skinny lips. You look like women, but your beards keep me from believing that you really are."

    m:

You’ve greeted my noble friend with honors and talk of a future so glorious that you’ve made him speechless. But you don’t say anything to me. If you can see the future and say how things will turn out, tell me. I don’t want your favors and I’m not afraid of your hatred."

      - "With such prophetic greeting. Speak, I charge you."
    m:
      - "Wait! You only told me part of what I want to know. Stay and tell me more. I already know I am the thane of Glamis because I inherited the position when my father, Sinel, died. But how can you call me the thane of Cawdor? The thane of Cawdor is alive, and he’s a rich and powerful man. And for me to be the king is completely impossible, just as it’s impossible for me to be thane of Cawdor. Tell me where you learned these strange things, and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting? Speak, I command you."

      - "Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight,"
      - "His wonders and his praises do contend"
      - "Which should be thine or his. Silenced with that,"
      - "In viewing o’er the rest o’ the selfsame day,"
      - "He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,"
      - "Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,"
      - "Strange images of death. As thick as tale"
      - "Can post with post, and every one did bear"
      - "Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense,"
      - "And poured them down before him."
    m:
      - "The king was happy to hear of your success, Macbeth. Whenever he hears the story of your exploits in the fight against the rebels, he becomes so amazed it makes him speechless. He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway, and that you weren’t the least bit afraid of death, even as you killed everyone around you. Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country."

    o:
      - "    We are sent"
      - "To give thee from our royal master thanks,"

    o:
      - "And, for an earnest of a greater honor,"
      - "He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:"
      - "In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,"
      - "For it is thine."
    m:
      - "And to give you a taste of what’s in store for you, he told me to call you the thane of Cawdor. So hail, thane of Cawdor! That title belongs to you now."

  - sp: BANQUO
    o:
      - "    What, can the devil speak true?"
    m:
      - "*(shocked)* Can the devil tell the truth?"

    o:
      - "The thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me"
      - "In borrowed robes?"
    m:

  - sp: ANGUS
    o:
      - "    Who was the thane lives yet,"
      - "But under heavy judgment bears that life"
      - "Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined"
      - "With those of Norway, or did line the rebel"
      - "With hidden help and vantage, or that with both"
      - "He labored in his country’s wrack, I know not;"
      - "But treasons capital, confessed and proved,"
      - "Have overthrown him."
    m:
      - "The man who was the thane of Cawdor is still alive, but he’s been sentenced to death, and he deserves to die. I don’t know whether he fought on Norway’s side, or if he secretly aided the rebels, or if he fought with both of our enemies. But his treason, which has been proven, and to which he’s confessed, means he’s finished."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:

      - "The greatest is behind. *(to ROSS and ANGUS)* Thanks for your pains."
      - "*(aside to BANQUO)* Do you not hope your children shall be kings,"
      - "When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me"
      - "Promised no less to them?"
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* It’s just like they said—now I’m the thane of Glamis and the thane of Cawdor. And the best part of what they predicted is still to come. *(to ROSS and ANGUS)* Thank you for the news. *(speaking so that only BANQUO can hear)* Aren’t you beginning to hope your children will be kings? After all, the witches who said I was thane of Cawdor promised them nothing less."

  - sp: BANQUO
    o:
      - "    That, trusted home,"
      - "Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,"
      - "Besides the thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange."

      - "The instruments of darkness tell us truths,"
      - "Win us with honest trifles, to betray ’s"
      - "In deepest consequence."
      - "*(to ROSS and ANGUS)* Cousins, a word, I pray you."
    m:
      - "If you trust what they say, you might be on your way to becoming king, as well as thane of Cawdor. But this whole thing is strange. The agents of evil often tell us part of the truth in order to lead us to our destruction. They earn our trust by telling us the truth about little things, but then they betray us when it will damage us the most. *(to ROSS and ANGUS)* Gentlemen, I’d like to have a word with you, please."

      - "If good, why do I yield to that suggestion"
      - "Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair"
      - "And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,"
      - "Against the use of nature? Present fears"
      - "Are less than horrible imaginings."
      - "My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,"
      - "Shakes so my single state of man"
      - "That function is smothered in surmise,"
      - "And nothing is but what is not."
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* So far the witches have told me two things that came true, so it seems like this will culminate in my becoming king. *(to ROSS and ANGUS)* Thank you, gentlemen. *(to himself)* This supernatural temptation doesn’t seem like it can be a bad thing, but it can’t be good either. If it’s a bad thing, why was I promised a promotion that turned out to be true? Now I’m the thane of Cawdor, just like they said I would be. But if this is a good thing, why do I find myself thinking about murdering King Duncan, a thought so horrifying that it makes my hair stand on end and my heart pound inside my chest? The dangers that actually threaten me here and now frighten me less than the horrible things I’m imagining. Even though it’s just a fantasy so far, the mere thought of committing murder shakes me up so much that I hardly know who I am anymore. My ability to act is stifled by my thoughts and speculations, and the only things that matter to me are things that don’t really exist."
