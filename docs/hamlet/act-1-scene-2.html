<p>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death</p>
<p>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</p>
<p>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom</p>
<p>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</p>
<p>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</p>
<p>That we with wisest sorrow think on him</p>
<p>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</p>
<p>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</p>
<p>Th’ imperial jointress to this warlike state,</p>
<p>Have we—as ’twere with a defeated joy,</p>
<p>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,</p>
<p>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,</p>
<p>In equal scale weighing delight and dole—</p>
<p>Taken to wife. Nor have we herein barred</p>
<p>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</p>
<p>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</p>
<p>Now follows that you know. Young Fortinbras,</p>
<p>Holding a weak supposal of our worth</p>
<p>Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death</p>
<p>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</p>
<p>Colleaguèd with the dream of his advantage,</p>
<p>He hath not failed to pester us with message</p>
<p>Importing the surrender of those lands</p>
<p>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</p>
<p>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</p>

<b>CLAUDIUS</b>
<p>Although I still have fresh memories of my brother the elder Hamlet’s death, and though it was proper to mourn him throughout our kingdom, life still goes on—I think it’s wise to mourn him while also thinking about my own well being. Therefore, I’ve married my former sister-in-law, the queen, with mixed feelings of happiness and sadness. I know that in marrying Gertrude I’m only doing what all of you have wisely advised all along—for which I thank you. Now, down to business. You all know what’s happening. Young Fortinbras, underestimating my strength or imagining that the death of the king has thrown my country into turmoil, dreams of getting the better of me, and never stops pestering me with demands that I surrender the territory his father lost to the elder Hamlet, my dead brother-in-law. So much for Fortinbras.</p>

<p>Now, here’s what needs to be done. I’ve written to Fortinbras’ uncle, the present head of Norway, an old bedridden man who knows next to nothing about his nephew’s plans.

I’m giving the job of delivering this letter to you, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand. Your business in Norway will be limited to this task. <em>(he gives them a paper)</em> Now good-bye.

<b>CLAUDIUS</b>
<p>’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</p>
<p>To give these mourning duties to your father.</p>
<p>But you must know your father lost a father,</p>
<p>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</p>
<p>In filial obligation for some term</p>
<p>To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever</p>
<p>In obstinate condolement is a course</p>
<p>Of impious stubbornness. ’Tis unmanly grief.</p>
<p>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</p>
<p>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</p>
<p>An understanding simple and unschooled.</p>
<p>For what we know must be and is as common</p>
<p>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</p>
<p>Why should we in our peevish opposition</p>
<p>Take it to heart? Fie! ’Tis a fault to heaven,</p>
<p>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</p>
<p>To reason most absurd, whose common theme</p>
<p>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</p>
<p>From the first corse till he that died today,</p>
<p>“This must be so.” We pray you, throw to earth</p>
<p>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</p>
<p>As of a father. For let the world take note,</p>
<p>You are the most immediate to our throne,</p>
<p>And with no less nobility of love</p>
<p>Than that which dearest father bears his son</p>
<p>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</p>
<p>In going back to school in Wittenberg,</p>
<p>It is most retrograde to our desire.</p>
<p>And we beseech you, bend you to remain</p>
<p>Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</p>
<p>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>CLAUDIUS</b>
<p>Hamlet, you are so sweet and such a good son to mourn your father like this. But you have to remember, that your father lost his father, who lost his father before him, and every time, each son has had to mourn his father for a certain period. But overdoing it is just stubborn. It’s not manly. It’s not what God wants, and it betrays a vulnerable heart and an ignorant and weak mind. Since we know that everyone must die sooner or later, why should we take it to heart? You’re committing a crime against heaven, against the dead, and against nature. And it’s irration-al, since the truth is that all fathers must die. Please give up this useless mourning of yours and start thinking of me as your new father. Because everyone knows that you are the man closest to this throne, and I love you just as much as any father loves his son. And your plans for going back to Wittenberg are not what I want. I’m asking you now to stay here in my company as the number-one member of my court, my nephew and now my son too.</p>

My father’s only been dead for two months—no, not even two. Such an excellent king, as superior to my uncle as a god is to a beast, and so loving toward my mother that he kept the wind from blowing too hard on her face. Oh God, do I have to remember that? She would hang on to him, and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him; she couldn’t get enough of him. Yet even so, within a month of my father’s death (I don’t even want to think about it. Oh women! You are so weak!), even before she had broken in the shoes she wore to his funeral, crying like crazy—even an animal would have mourned its mate longer than she did!—there she was marrying my uncle, my father’s brother, who’s about as much like my father as I’m like Hercules. Less than a month after my father’s death, even before the tears on her cheeks had dried, she remarried. Oh, so quick to jump into a bed of incest! That’s not good, and no good can come of it either. But my heart must break in silence, since I can’t mention my feelings aloud.</p>

<p>Two nights together had these gentlemen,</p>
<p>Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch,</p>
<p>In the dead waste and middle of the night,</p>
<p>Been thus encountered: a figure like your father,</p>
<p>Armed at point exactly, cap-à-pie,</p>
<p>Appears before them and with solemn march</p>
<p>Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walked</p>
<p>By their oppressed and fear-surprisèd eyes</p>
<p>Within his truncheon’s length, whilst they, distilled</p>
<p>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</p>
<p>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me</p>
<p>In dreadful secrecy impart they did,</p>
<p>And I with them the third night kept the watch,</p>
<p>Where—as they had delivered, both in time,</p>
<p>Form of the thing, each word made true and good—</p>
<p>The apparition comes. I knew your father.</p>
<p>These hands are not more like.</p>

<b>HORATIO</b>
<p>After midnight, for two nights running, these two guards, Marcellus and Barnardo, saw a figure that looked very much like your father, in full armor from head to toe. It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times, a staff’s distance from their amazed eyes, while they turned, quaking with fear and too shocked to speak. They told me all about this, so on the third night I agreed to come stand guard with them, to see for myself. It happened again, just as they had described. I knew your father. This ghost looked as much like him as my two hands are like each other.</p>
