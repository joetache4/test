      - "Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,"
      - "And yet methinks I have astronomy,"
      - "But not to tell of good or evil luck,"
      - "Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons’ quality;"
      - "Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,"
      - "Pointing to each his thunder, rain, and wind,"
      - "Or say with princes if it shall go well,"
      - "By oft predict that I in heaven find;"
      - "But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,"
      - "And, constant stars, in them I read such art"
      - "As truth and beauty shall together thrive,"
      - "If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;"
      - "  Or else of thee this I prognosticate:"
      - "  Thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date."

      - "I don’t base my judgments on the stars, and yet it does seem to me I know astrology. I can’t foresee good or bad events—predict plagues, famines, or what a season will be like. Nor can I predict down to the minute what each person’s misfortunes are going to be. Nor can I tell princes whether things will go well for them by looking at the heavens. But I can forecast the future by looking in your eyes. I see by those reliable guides that truth and beauty will thrive if you would only pass your attributes on to a child. Otherwise, this is what I predict: When you die, truth and beauty will die with you."
