  - os: "TITANIA sleeps. Enter the clowns: BOTTOM, QUINCE, FLUTE, SNUG, SNOUT, and STARVELING"
    ms: "While TITANIA is asleep onstage, the clowns—BOTTOM, QUINCE, FLUTE, SNUG, SNOUT, and STARVELING—enter."

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "Are we all met?"
    m:
      - "Are we all here?"

  - sp: QUINCE
    o:
      - "Pat, pat. And here’s a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house, and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke."
    m:
      - "Right on time. This is the perfect place to rehearse. This clearing will be the stage, and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room. Let’s put on our play exactly as we’ll perform it for the duke."

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "Peter Quince—"
    m:
      - "Peter Quince—"

  - sp: QUINCE
    o:
      - "What sayest thou, bully Bottom?"
    m:
      - "What is it, jolly Bottom?"

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?"
    m:
      - "There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never work. First of all, Pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself, which the ladies in the audience won’t be able to stand. What should we do about that?"

  - sp: SNOUT
    o:
      - "By ’r lakin, a parlous fear."
    m:
      - "By God, that’s a real problem, it’s true."

  - sp: STARVELING
    o:
      - "I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done."
    m:
      - "I think we’ll have to leave out all the killing, come to think of it."

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "Not a whit. I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed. And for the more better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put them out of fear."
    m:
      - "Not at all! I’ve got a plan that will fix everything. Write me a prologue that I can recite to the audience before the play starts. I’ll tell them that we won’t hurt anyone with our swords, and that Pyramus isn’t really dead. And to make it even clearer, we can tell them that I’m playing Pyramus but I’m not really Pyramus—really, I’m Bottom the weaver. That’ll keep them from being afraid."

  - sp: QUINCE
    o:
      - "Well. We will have such a prologue, and it shall be written in eight and six."
    m:
      - "All right, we’ll have a prologue then. We’ll write it in alternating eight- and six-syllable lines, just like in a ballad."

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "No, make it two more. Let it be written in eight and eight."
    m:
      - "No, add a couple more syllables. Make it eight and eight."

  - sp: SNOUT
    o:
      - "Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?"
    m:
      - "Won’t the ladies be scared of the lion?"

  - sp: STARVELING
    o:
      - "I fear it, I promise you."
    m:
      - "I’m really worried about that."

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves. To bring in—God shield us!—a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living. And we ought to look to ’t."
    m:
      - "Sirs, you ought to think to yourself, bringing in—God forbid!—a lion amongst ladies is really terrible. There’s no scarier wild bird than the living lion, and we should remember that."

  - sp: SNOUT
    o:
      - "Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion."
    m:
      - "So we need another prologue to tell everyone he’s not a real lion."

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion’s neck. And he himself must speak through, saying thus—or to the same defect—“Ladies,” or “Fair ladies,” “I would wish you” or “I would request you” or “I would entreat you” “not to fear, not to tremble, my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such thing. I am a man as other men are.” And there indeed let him name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner."
    m:
      - "No, we can just announce the actor’s name, and let his face show through the lion costume, and have him say something himself. He should say the following, or something else to the same defect—“Ladies,” or “Lovely ladies,” “I would like to ask you” or “I would like to request of you” or “I would like to beg you” “not to be afraid, and not to tremble with fear. I value your lives as highly as my own. If you thought I was a real lion, I would be risking my life. But no, I am not at all a lion. I am a man, just like other men.” And then he should say his name, and tell them plainly that he’s Snug the carpenter."

  - sp: QUINCE
    o:
      - "Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber. For, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight."
    m:
      - "All right, that’s what we’ll do then. But there are two things we still have to figure out. How are we going to bring moonlight into a room? Because, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight."

  - sp: SNOUT
    o:
      - "Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?"
    m:
      - "Will the moon be shining on the night we’re performing our play?"

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac. Find out moonshine, find out moonshine!"
    m:
      - "We need a calendar! Look in the almanac. Look up moonshine, look up moonshine!"

  - sp: QUINCE
    o:
      - "*(takes out a book)* Yes, it doth shine that night."
    m:
      - "*(he takes out a book)* Yes, the moon will shine that night."

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "Why then, may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open, and the moon may shine in at the casement."
    m:
      - "Well then, you can leave one of the windows open in the big hall where we’ll be performing, and the moon can shine in through the window."

  - sp: QUINCE
    o:
      - "Ay. Or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber. For Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall."
    m:
      - "Yes, or else someone will have to come in carrying a bundle of sticks and a lantern and say he’s come to disfigure, or represent, the character of Moonshine, because the man in the moon is supposed to carry sticks and a lantern. But there’s still another problem: we need to have a wall in the big hall, because according to the story, Pyramus and Thisbe talked through a little hole in a wall."

  - sp: SNOUT
    o:
      - "You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?"
    m:
      - "You’ll never be able to bring in a wall. What do you think, Bottom?"

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "Some man or other must present Wall. And let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some roughcast about him to signify wall. And let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper."
    m:
      - "Someone should play the part of Wall. He can have some plaster or clay or limestone or something on him to show the audience he’s a wall. He can hold his fingers in a V-shape like this, and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack."

  - sp: QUINCE
    o:
      - "If that may be then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts.—Pyramus, you begin. When you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake.—And so everyone according to his cue."
    m:
      - "If we can do that, everything will be all right. Now sit down, everybody, and rehearse your parts—Pyramus, you start. When you have said your lines, go hide in that bush.—Everyone else, go there too when you’re not onstage."

  - os: "Enter ROBIN unseen"
    ms: "ROBIN enters, unseen by the characters onstage."

  - sp: ROBIN
    o:
      - "*(aside)* What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,"
      - "So near the cradle of the fairy queen?"
      - "What, a play toward? I’ll be an auditor."
      - "An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause."
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* Who are these country bumpkins swaggering around so close to where the fairy queen is sleeping? What? Are they about to put on a play? I’ll watch. And I’ll act in it, too, if I feel like it."

  - sp: QUINCE

    m:

    o:
      - "Ay, marry, must you. For you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again."
    m:
      - "Yes, you are. You’re supposed to show that you understand that Pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back."

  - sp: FLUTE
    o:
      - "*(as THISBE)* Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,"
      - "Of color like the red rose on triumphant brier,"
      - "Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,"
      - "As true as truest horse that yet would never tire."
      - "I’ll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny’s tomb."
    m:
      - "*(as THISBE)* Most radiant Pyramus, you are as white as a lily, and the color of a red rose on a splendid rosebush, a very lively young man and also a lovely Jew. You are as reliable as a horse that never gets tired. I’ll meet you, Pyramus, at Ninny’s grave."

  - sp: QUINCE
    o:
      - "“Ninus’ tomb,” man. Why, you must not speak that yet. That you answer to Pyramus. You speak all your part at once, cues and all.—Pyramus, enter. Your cue is past. It is “never tire.”"
    m:
      - "That’s “Ninus’ grave,” man. And don’t say all of that yet. You’re supposed to say some of it as a reply to Pyramus. You just said all your lines at once, cues and all.—Pyramus, enter. You missed your cue. It’s “never get tired.”"

  - sp: FLUTE
    o:

  - sp: BOTTOM
    o:
      - "Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that."
      - "And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays. The more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion."
    m:
      - "I don’t think you’ve got much of a reason to love me. But to tell you the truth, reason and love have very little to do with each other these days. It’s too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn’t introduce them. Ha, ha! No, I’m just kidding."

So come with me. I’ll give you fairies as servants, and they’ll bring you jewels from the depths of the ocean, and sing to you while you sleep on a bed of flowers. And I’ll turn you into a spirit like us, so you won’t die as humans do.—Come here, Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed!"

Steal honey from the bumblebees, and make candles out of the bees’ wax. Light them with the light of glowworms, so my love will have light when he goes to bed and wakes up.
