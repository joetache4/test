    o:
      - "Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch’d upon"
      - "The deserts of Bohemia?"
    m:
      - "You are sure that our ship has landed at the desert of Bohemia?"

  - sp: MARINER
    o:
      - "Ay, my lord: and fear"
      - "We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly"
      - "And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,"
      - "The heavens with that we have in hand are angry"
      - "And frown upon ’s."
    m:
      - "Yes, my lord, and I fear we’ve landed at a bad time. The sky is dark, and it looks as though a storm approaches. It seems to me that the heavens are angry at what we are about to do and are unhappy with us."

  - sp: ANTIGONUS
    o:
      - "Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;"
      - "Look to thy bark: I’ll not be long before"
      - "I call upon thee."
    m:
      - "Let their sacred will be done! Go aboard, and see to your ship. I’ll call for you shortly."

    o:
      - "Make your best haste, and go not"
      - "Too far i’ the land: ’tis like to be loud weather;"
      - "Besides, this place is famous for the creatures"
      - "Of prey that keep upon’t."
    m:
      - "Go as quickly as you can, and don’t venture too far inland. It promises to be a dreadful storm, and this area is famous for its predators."

  - sp: ANTIGONUS
    o:
      - "Go thou away:"
      - "I’ll follow instantly."
    m:
      - "Go away. I’ll be right behind you."

  - sp: MARINER
    o:

    o:
      - "Come, poor babe:"
      - "I have heard, but not believed,"
      - "the spirits o’ the dead"
      - "May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother"
      - "Appear’d to me last night, for ne’er was dream"
      - "So like a waking. To me comes a creature,"
      - "Sometimes her head on one side, some another;"
      - "I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,"
      - "So fill’d and so becoming: in pure white robes,"
      - "Like very sanctity, she did approach"
      - "My cabin where I lay; thrice bow’d before me,"
      - "And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes"
      - "Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon"
      - "Did this break-from her: “Good Antigonus,"
      - "Since fate, against thy better disposition,"
      - "Hath made thy person for the thrower-out"
      - "Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,"
      - "Places remote enough are in Bohemia,"
      - "There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe"
      - "Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,"
      - "I prithee, call’t. For this ungentle business"
      - "Put on thee by my lord, thou ne’er shalt see"
      - "Thy wife Paulina more.” And so, with shrieks"
      - "She melted into air. Affrighted much,"
      - "I did in time collect myself and thought"
      - "This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:"
      - "Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,"
      - "I will be squared by this. I do believe"
      - "Hermione hath suffer’d death, and that"
      - "Apollo would, this being indeed the issue"
      - "Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,"
      - "Either for life or death, upon the earth"
      - "Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!"
      - "There lie, and there thy character: there these;"
      - "Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,"
      - "And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,"
      - "That for thy mother’s fault art thus exposed"
      - "To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,"
      - "But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I"
      - "To be by oath enjoin’d to this. Farewell!"
      - "The day frowns more and more: thou’rt like to have"
      - "A lullaby too rough: I never saw"
      - "The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!"
      - "Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:"
      - "I am gone for ever."
    m:
      - "Come, poor child. I’ve heard but never believed that the spirits of the dead might walk the earth. But perhaps it is true, because last night your mother appeared to me, and no dream ever seemed so real. She comes to me with her head to one side or the other, and I’ve never seen anyone so filled with sorrow and so beautiful. Dressed in pure white robes, she came to my room where I was resting. She bowed three times to me, and struggling to speak, she broke into tears. Once her fury was spent, these words came out: “Good Antigonus, since fate, against your good nature, has chosen you to cast out my child according to your oath, leave her in the remote places of Bohemia. There you weep, and leave the child crying. Since she is lost forever, I ask you to call her Perdita. Because of this terrible business forced upon you, you will never see your wife Paulina again.” And then she disappeared, shrieking. Very frightened, I finally got myself together and decided it had truly happened and wasn’t a dream. Dreams are just trifles, but for this once, even if it’s superstition, I’ll be ruled by one. I believe that Hermione has died, and that this child is truly the child of King Polixenes, so Apollo would want her to be left, whether to life or death, on the land of her real father. Blossom, fare you well! *(he lays down the child and a scroll)* Lie there, and I’ll put an account of your parentage with you. *(he puts down a box)* These jewels and gold will help pay for your upbringing, and if fortune pleases, leave some left over for you. * (thunder)* The storm is beginning. Poor child, because of your mother’s transgressions you are left out to die! I can’t weep, but my heart bleeds, and I’m cursed for having to do this deed. Farewell! The day gets worse and worse. You are likely to be lulled to sleep with a rough lullaby. I’ve never seen the sky look so dark during the day. What a savage noise! I’ll be lucky to get on board! This is the hunt! I’m gone forever."

  - os: "Exit, pursued by a bear"
    ms: "He exits, chased by a bear."

  - os: "Enter a Shepherd"
    ms: "A SHEPHERD enters."

  - sp: SHEPHERD
    o:
      - "I would there were no age between sixteen and"
      - "three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the"
      - "rest; for there is nothing in the between but"
      - "getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,"
      - "stealing, fighting—Hark you now! Would any but"
      - "these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty"
      - "hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my"
      - "best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find"
      - "than the master: if any where I have them, ’tis by"
      - "the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an’t be thy"
      - "will what have we here! Mercy on ’s, a barne a very"
      - "pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A"
      - "pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some ’scape:"
      - "though I am not bookish, yet I can read"
      - "waiting-gentlewoman in the ’scape. This has been"
      - "some stair-work, some trunk-work, some"
      - "behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this"
      - "than the poor thing is here. I’ll take it up for"
      - "pity: yet I’ll tarry till my son come; he hallooed"
      - "but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!"
    m:
      - "I wish that the ages between sixteen and twenty-three didn’t exist, or that young men would spend them asleep. Otherwise there is nothing between those ages but getting girls pregnant, acting dishonestly toward their elders, stealing, fighting—look at this! Would anyone but an addlebrained nineteen or twenty-two-year-old hunt in this weather? They’ve scared away two of my best sheep, which I’m afraid the wolf will find before I do. If I find them anywhere it’ll be by the shore, eating ivy. What is this here? Mercy, it’s a baby, a pretty baby! A boy or a girl, I wonder? A pretty one, a very pretty one. Here is the product of some forbidden affair. I’m not a scholar, but I can read the signs of a lady-in-waiting behind this. It must have been some secret sexual relationship carried out in back stairs, in large chests, or behind closed doors. The man and woman who conceived this child were more hot-blooded than the poor baby is. Out of pity I’ll take it, but I’ll wait here until my son comes. I heard him shout just a moment ago. Hallo!"

  - os: "Enter Clown"
    ms: "A YOKEL enters."

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "Hilloa, loa!"
    m:
      - "Hallo!"

  - sp: SHEPHERD
    o:
      - "What, art so near? If thou’lt see a thing to talk"
      - "on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What"
      - "ailest thou, man?"
    m:
      - "What, are you near? If you want to see something to talk about when you are dead and rotten, come here. What is wrong with you?"

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!"
      - "but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the"
      - "sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust"
      - "a bodkin’s point."
    m:
      - "I’ve seen two such sights, on sea and on land! But I won’t say it is a sea, since the sky is just as wet from the storm. You couldn’t squeeze a needle’s point between the sky and the sea."

  - sp: SHEPHERD
    o:
      - "Why, boy, how is it?"
    m:
      - "Why, boy, what’s happening there?"

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,"
      - "how it takes up the shore! but that’s not the"
      - "point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!"
      - "sometimes to see ’em, and not to see ’em; now the"
      - "ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon"
      - "swallowed with yest and froth, as you’ld thrust a"
      - "cork into a hogshead. And then for the"
      - "land-service, to see how the bear tore out his"
      - "shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said"
      - "his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an"
      - "end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned"
      - "it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the"
      - "sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared"
      - "and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than"
      - "the sea or weather."
    m:
      - "I wish you could see how it rages and rushes up the shore! But that’s not the point. Oh, the pitiful cries of the men, coming in and out of sight. Then the ship would rise up so its mast looked like it hit the moon, and the next moment it was swallowed by the frothing waves. And then on land, I saw how the bear tore out his shoulder, and he cried to me for help. He said his name was Antigonus, and he was a nobleman. But to finish telling you about the ship, you should have seen how the sea swallowed it up. But first the poor men roared, and the sea mocked them, and then the poor gentleman roared, and the bear mocked him, and they both roared louder than either the sea or the storm."

  - sp: SHEPHERD
    o:
      - "Name of mercy, when was this, boy?"
    m:
      - "Goodness me, when did this happen?"

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these"
      - "sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor"
      - "the bear half dined on the gentleman: he’s at it"
      - "now."
    m:
      - "Just now—I haven’t even blinked since I saw these sights. The men aren’t yet cold under the water, and the bear has only partly dined on the gentleman—he’s still eating now."

  - sp: SHEPHERD
    o:
      - "Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!"
    m:
      - "If only I’d been close by to help the gentleman!"

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "I would you had been by the ship side, to have"
      - "helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing."
    m:
      - "I wish you had been near the ship so you could have helped it—on the water you wouldn’t have had a place to stand."

  - sp: SHEPHERD
    o:
      - "Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,"
      - "boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things"
      - "dying, I with things newborn. Here’s a sight for"
      - "thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire’s"
      - "child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;"
      - "open’t. So, let’s see: it was told me I should be"
      - "rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:"
      - "open’t. What’s within, boy?"
    m:
      - "Sad affairs, sad affairs! But look here, boy. Say a blessing. While you were watching things dying, I was meeting with things newly born. Here’s a sight for you. Look, baby clothes for a squire’s child! Look here, pick it up, boy, and open it. Let’s see what’s in it. I’ve been told that the fairies would make me rich. This is some changeling. Open it. What’s in it, boy?"

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "You’re a made old man: if the sins of your youth"
      - "are forgiven you, you’re well to live. Gold! all gold!"
    m:
      - "You are set, old man! As long as the sins of your youth have been forgiven, you’ll live well. It’s gold, all gold!"

  - sp: SHEPHERD
    o:
      - "This is fairy gold, boy, and ’twill prove so: up"
      - "with’t, keep it close: home, home, the next way."
      - "We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires"
      - "nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good"
      - "boy, the next way home."
    m:
      - "This is fairy gold, boy, and will prove to be. Pick it up, and hold it close. Let’s go home. We are lucky, boy, and to keep it that way we have to keep this matter a secret. Let the sheep go. Come, good boy, let’s go home."

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "Go you the next way with your findings. I’ll go see"
      - "if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much"
      - "he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they"
      - "are hungry: if there be any of him left, I’ll bury"
      - "it."
    m:
      - "Go home yourself with what you’ve found. I’ll go see if the bear has left the gentleman and how much of him he ate. They are only vicious when they are hungry. If there is anything left of the gentleman, I’ll bury it."

  - sp: SHEPHERD
    o:
      - "That’s a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that"
      - "which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the"
      - "sight of him."
    m:
      - "That’s a good deed. If you can tell by what’s left of him who he was, bring me to the body."

  - sp: CLOWN
    o:
      - "Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i’ the ground."
    m:
      - "I will, and then you can help me bury him."

  - sp: SHEPHERD
    o:
      - "’Tis a lucky day, boy, and we’ll do good deeds on’t."
    m:
      - "It’s a lucky day, boy, and we’ll do good deeds to mark it."

  - os: "Exeunt."
    ms: "They exit."
