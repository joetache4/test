<p>I’ll do well. The people are on my side, and I’m in charge of the sea. My forces are growing, and everything I know tells me it’s all coming together. Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won’t be going outside to make war. Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money. Lepidus flatters both of them, as they flatter him, but he doesn’t love them, and they don’t love him.</p>

<p>Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,</p>

<p>He’s dreaming. I know they’re in Rome together, hoping for Antony to return. Lecherous Cleopatra, may all the charms of love soften those withered lips! Join your witchcraft with your beauty, and let Antony’s lust combine with both. Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery. Keep his brain drunk and his appetite unsatisfied, so that sleeping and eating make him drowsy and forgetful of his duties, like the Lethe does.</p>

<p>I could have given less matter</p>
<p>A better ear.—Menas, I did not think</p>
<p>This amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm</p>
<p>For such a petty war. His soldiership</p>
<p>Is twice the other twain. But let us rear</p>
<p>The higher our opinion, that our stirring</p>
<p>Can from the lap of Egypt’s widow pluck</p>
<p>The ne’er lust-wearied Antony.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>POMPEY</b>
<p>I would have listened to less important news with greater enthusiasm. Menas, I had no idea this amorous glutton would have put on his helmet for such an insignificant war. His military ability is double that of the other two. We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony’s attention away from that Egyptian widow.</p>

<p>I cannot hope</p>
<p>Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.</p>

<p>Not moved by Antony.</p>

<p>I don’t expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion. Antony’s dead wife raised an army against him, as did his brother, though I don’t think Antony instigated it.</p>

<p>I know not, Menas,</p>
<p>How lesser enmities may give way to greater.</p>
<p>Were ’t not that we stand up against them all,</p>
<p>’Twere pregnant they should square between themselves,</p>
<p>For they have entertainèd cause enough</p>
<p>To draw their swords. But how the fear of us</p>
<p>May cement their divisions and bind up</p>
<p>The petty difference, we yet not know.</p>
<p>Be ’t as our gods will have ’t. It only stands</p>
<p>Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.</p>
<p>Come, Menas.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>POMPEY</b>
<p>Menas, I don’t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones. If it weren’t for the fact that we oppose all three of them together, they’d be fighting each other. They certainly have enough provocation. But it’s possible the fear of us may mend their petty differences, though how that will work out, we cannot say. It will be as the gods see fit. In any case, our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible. Let’s go, Menas.</p>
