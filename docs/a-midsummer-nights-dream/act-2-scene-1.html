<p>I go over hills and valleys, through bushes and thorns, over parks and fenced-in spaces, through water and fire. I wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the Earth. I work for Titania, the Fairy Queen, and organize fairy dances for her in the grass. The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards. You’ll see that their petals have spots on them—those are rubies, fairy gifts. Their sweet smells come from those little freckles. Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower. Goodbye, you dumb old spirit. I’ve got to go. The queen and her elves will be here soon.</p>

<p>The king’s having a party here tonight. Just make sure the queen doesn’t come anywhere near him, because King Oberon is extremely angry. He’s furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king. She’s never kidnapped such a darling human child before, and Oberon’s jealous. He wants the child for himself, to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests. But the queen refuses to hand the boy over to Oberon. Instead, she puts flowers in the boy’s hair and makes a fuss over him. And now Oberon and Titania refuse to speak to each other, or meet each other anywhere—neither in the forest nor on the plain, nor by the river nor under the stars. They always argue, and the little fairies get so frightened that they hide in acorn cups and won’t come out.</p>

<b>ROBIN</b>
<p>What you say is true. That’s me you’re talking about, the playful wanderer of the night. I tell jokes to Oberon and make him smile. I’ll trick a fat, well-fed horse into thinking that I’m a young female horse. Sometimes I hide at the bottom of an old woman’s drink disguised as an apple. When she takes a sip, I bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck. Sometimes a wise old woman with a sad story to tell tries to sit down on me, thinking I’m a three-legged stool. But I slip from underneath her and she falls down, crying, “Ow, my butt!” and starts coughing, and then everyone laughs and has fun. But step aside, fairy! Here comes Oberon.</p>

<b>TITANIA</b>
<p>These are the forgeries of jealousy.</p>
<p>And never, since the middle summer’s spring,</p>
<p>Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,</p>
<p>By pavèd fountain, or by rushy brook,</p>
<p>Or in the beachèd margent of the sea,</p>
<p>To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,</p>
<p>But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.</p>
<p>Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,</p>
<p>As in revenge, have sucked up from the sea</p>
<p>Contagious fogs, which falling in the land</p>
<p>Have every pelting river made so proud</p>
<p>That they have overborne their continents.</p>
<p>The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain,</p>
<p>The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn</p>
<p>Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard.</p>
<p>The fold stands empty in the drownèd field,</p>
<p>And crows are fatted with the murrain flock.</p>
<p>The nine-men’s-morris is filled up with mud,</p>
<p>And the quaint mazes in the wanton green</p>
<p>For lack of tread are undistinguishable.</p>
<p>The human mortals want their winter here.</p>
<p>No night is now with hymn or carol blessed.</p>
<p>Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,</p>
<p>Pale in her anger, washes all the air,</p>
<p>That rheumatic diseases do abound.</p>
<p>And thorough this distemperature we see</p>
<p>The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts</p>
<p>Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,</p>
<p>And on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown</p>
<p>An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds</p>
<p>Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,</p>
<p>The childing autumn, angry winter change</p>
<p>Their wonted liveries, and the mazèd world,</p>
<p>By their increase, now knows not which is which.</p>
<p>And this same progeny of evils comes</p>
<p>From our debate, from our dissension.</p>
<p>We are their parents and original.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>TITANIA</b>
<p>These are nothing but jealous lies. Since the beginning of midsummer, my fairies and I haven’t been able to meet anywhere to do our dances in the wind without being disturbed by you and your arguments. We haven’t been able to meet on a hill or in a valley, in the forest or a meadow, by a pebbly fountain or a rushing stream, or on the beach by the ocean without you disturbing us. And because you interrupt us so that we can’t dance for them, the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood, just to get revenge on you. So all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing, because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe. Sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields, and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep. All the fields where people usually play games are filled with mud, and you can’t even see the elaborate mazes that people create in the grass, because no one walks in them anymore and they’ve all grown over. It’s not winter here for the human mortals, so they’re not protected by the holy hymns and carols that they sing in winter. So the pale, angry moon, who controls the tides, fills the air with diseases. As a consequence of this bad weather and these bad moods the seasons have started to change. Cold frosts spread over the red roses, and the icy winter wears a crown of sweet summer flowers as some sick joke. Spring, summer, fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed places, and now the confused world doesn’t know which is which. And this is all because of our argument. We are responsible for this.</p>

<b>TITANIA</b>
<p>Get over it. I won’t give up this child for all of Fairyland. His mother was one of my worshippers, and we always used to gossip together at night in India, sitting together by the ocean and watching the merchant ships sailing on the ocean. We used to laugh to see the sails fill up with wind so that they looked like they had big, pregnant bellies, as if the wind had gotten them pregnant. She would imitate them—since she was already pregnant with the little boy—and she would go sailing over the land herself to go get me little presents, and come back carrying gifts like she was a ship coming back from a voyage. But since she was a mortal, she died giving birth to that boy, and for her sake I’m raising him and will not give him up.</p>

<p>That same night, I saw Cupid flying from the moon to the earth, with all of his arrows ready. (You couldn’t see him, but I could.) He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world, and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts. But I could see that Cupid’s fiery arrow was put out by watery, virginal moonbeams, so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love. But I paid attention to where Cupid’s arrow fell. It fell on a little western flower, which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love. Young girls call it “love-in-idleness.” Bring me that flower. I showed it to you once. If its juice is put on someone’s eyelids while they’re asleep, that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees. Bring me this plant, and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles.</p>

<p>I am your spaniel. And, Demetrius,</p>
<p>The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.</p>

<p>Neglect me, lose me. Only give me leave,</p>
<p>Unworthy as I am, to follow you.</p>
<p>What worser place can I beg in your love—</p>
<p>And yet a place of high respect with me—</p>
<p>Than to be usèd as you use your dog?</p>

<b>HELENA</b>
<p>Yes, but that makes me love you even more. I’m your little dog, Demetrius. The more you beat me, the more I’ll love you. Treat me like you would treat a dog—kick me, hit me, neglect me, try to lose me. Just let me follow behind you, even though I’m not good enough for you. Could I ask for a worse place in your heart than to be treated as you would treat a dog? And yet I would consider it an honor to be your dog.</p>

<p>The wildest animal isn’t as cruel as you are. Run whenever you want to. The story of Daphne and Apollo will be changed: the lustful god Apollo runs away from the virginal nymph Daphne who pursues him, the dove chases after the griffin, which is usually its predator, and the gentle deer tries to hunt down the tiger—speed is useless when the cowardly person chases and the brave person runs away.</p>

<p>Please, give it to me. <em>(he takes the flower from ROBIN)</em> I know a place where wild thyme blooms, and oxlips and violets grow. It’s covered over with luscious honeysuckle, sweet muskroses and sweetbrier. Titania sleeps there sometimes at night, lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights. Snakes shed their skin there, and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in. I’ll put the juice of this flower on Titania’s eyes, and fill her with horrible delusions and desires. <em>(he gives ROBIN part of the flower)</em> You take some of it too, and look around in this part of the forest. A sweet Athenian lady is in love with a young man who wants nothing to do with her. Put some of this flower’s juice on his eyes, and make sure to do it in such a way that the next thing he sees will be the lady. You’ll be able to tell it’s him because he’s wearing Athenian clothes. Do it carefully, so that he’ll end up loving her more than she loves him. And then make sure to meet me before the rooster’s first crow at dawn.</p>
