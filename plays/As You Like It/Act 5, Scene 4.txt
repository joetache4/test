      - "I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not,"

      - "Obscurèd in the circle of this forest."
    m:
      - "My lord, when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter’s brother. But, my lord, this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic. His uncle, who the boy says is a great magician and lives concealed within the boundaries of this forest, taught him."

    o:
      - "There is sure another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools."
    m:
      - "Well, look: there must be another flood coming, with these couples also on their way to Noah’s ark. Here comes a pair of those strange creatures called “fools” in any language."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Salutation and greeting to you all."
    m:
      - "Hello, and greetings to you all."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he swears."
    m:
      - "My lord, welcome this man. This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest. He swears he used to be a courtier."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure. I have flattered a lady. I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy. I have undone three tailors. I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one."
    m:
      - "If anyone doubts this, let him put me on trial. I have danced a round, I have flattered a lady, I have been polite with my friends, smooth and cunning with my enemies. I have bankrupted three tailors. I have quarreled four times, and almost got in a fight."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "And how was that ta’en up?"
    m:
      - "And how was that one settled?"

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Faith, we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause."
    m:
      - "Well, we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "How “seventh cause”?—Good my lord, like this fellow."
    m:
      - "What do you mean, the seventh cause? *(to DUKE SENIOR )* My good lord, I hope you like this fellow."

  - sp: DUKE SENIOR
    o:
      - "I like him very well."
    m:
      - "I like him very well."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "God ’ild you, sir. I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favored thing, sir, but mine own. A poor humor of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in your foul oyster."
    m:
      - "God bless you, sir. I want the same thing as all these other people. I’ve come here to be married, like all these other would-be couples. This poor virgin isn’t much to look at, sir, but she’s mine. It’s a strange habit of mine to take the thing that no one else wants: virginity in an ugly girl is like a rich man living in a broken-down house or a pearl in the hideous oyster."

  - sp: DUKE SENIOR
    o:
      - "By my faith, he is very swift and sententious."
    m:
      - "Really, he’s very witty, and full of wise sayings."

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "According to the fool’s bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases."
    m:
      - "His wittiness, a sweet disease, is here one minute and gone the next, sir, as with most fools."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "But for the seventh cause. How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?"
    m:
      - "But back to that argument you mentioned. What’s the “seventh cause”?"

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "Upon a lie seven times removed.—Bear your body more seeming, Audrey.—As thus, sir: I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is called “the retort courteous.” If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself. This is called “the quip modest.” If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment. This is called “the reply churlish.” If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is called “the reproof valiant.” If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This is called “the countercheck quarrelsome,” and so to “the lie circumstantial” and “the lie direct.”"
    m:
      - "Our argument went through seven stages—watch your posture, Audrey.—It went like this. I didn’t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard. He sent me word that, whether I liked it or not, he liked it fine. They call this “the courteous retort.” If I repeat that it isn’t cut well, and he responds that he isn’t trying to please me, just himself, with his beard. They call this “ the modest quip.” If I say again it is poorly cut, and he responds that my judgment is no good, they call this “the sullen reply.” If I say yet again that his beard is poorly cut, and he says that I’m not speaking the truth, they call this “the brave retort.” One more time I say it’s not well cut, and he says I’m lying. They call this “the argumentative countercheck.” And so on through “the circumstantial lie” and “the direct lie.”"

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?"
    m:
      - "And how many times did you say his beard wasn’t cut well?"

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the lie direct, and so we measured swords and parted."
    m:
      - "I didn’t dare take it past “the circumstantial lie,” and he didn’t dare go to the “direct lie,” so we compared the lengths of our swords and then ended the fight."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?"
    m:
      - "Can you name the steps of that argument again?"

  - sp: TOUCHSTONE
    o:
      - "O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees: the first, “the retort courteous”; the second, “the quip modest”; the third, “the reply churlish”; the fourth, “the reproof valiant”; the fifth, “the countercheque quarrelsome”; the sixth, “the lie with circumstance”; the seventh, “the lie direct.” All these you may avoid but the lie direct, and you may avoid that, too, with an “if.” I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an “if,” as: “If you said so, then I said so.” And they shook hands and swore brothers. Your “if” is the only peacemaker: much virtue in “if.”"
    m:
      - "Of course, sir. There are rulebooks for arguing just as there are rulebooks for manners. Here are the steps. First is “the courteous retort”; second, “the modest quip”; third, “the sullen reply”; fourth, “the valiant retort”; fifth, “the argumentative countercheck”; sixth, “the circumstantial lie”; seventh, “the direct lie.” You can avoid getting to that final stage if you can properly use an “if.” I once heard of an argument that seven judges couldn’t settle. The two parties met up on their own, and one said, “Well, if you said this-and-that, then I must have said such-and-such,” and they shook hands and parted on good terms. “If” is the only peacemaker. “If” is a very valuable word."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? He’s as good at anything and yet a fool."
    m:
      - "Isn’t he a remarkable fellow, my lord? He’s as smart as they come, but just a jester."

  - sp: DUKE SENIOR
    o:
      - "He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit."
    m:
      - "He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit."

When Duke Frederick heard that great, worthy men were coming to this forest every day, he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother. But just at the edge of the forest, he met an old religious man. He spoke with him for a while and decided not only to abandon his pursuit of his brother but even to retreat from the world. He’s giving the throne to his banished brother and restoring all the men he’d exiled to their rightful lands. I swear on my life that I’m speaking the truth."

But first, let’s finish the things we started out here. Then I’ll share the abundance of my returned fortune with all those that have stayed out here with me, according to the rank and status each of you enjoy. But until then, let’s forget our nobility and enjoy some fun. Music, please. Brides and bridegrooms, dance your happiness away."

If it be true that good wine needs no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes, and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a case am I in, then, that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play. I am not furnished like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you, and I’ll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you. And I charge you, O men, for the love you bear to women— as I perceive by your simpering, none of you hates them— that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me, complexions that liked me, and breaths that I defied not. And I am sure as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell."
    m:
      - "You don’t usually see a woman deliver an epilogue, but it’s no worse than seeing a man deliver the prologue. If it’s true that you don’t need ivy to sell good wine, then it should also be true that a good play doesn’t need an epilogue. But they use good-quality ivy to sell good wine, and a good play is improved by a good epilogue. But then I’m in a strange position, as I not only do not have a good epilogue, I’m not sure this was a good play. I’m not dressed like a beggar, so it wouldn’t be becoming for me to beg. No, instead I’ll bewitch you, and I’ll start with the women. Women, in the name of the love you have for men, I demand that you like as much of this play as you feel like. Men, in the name of the women you love—and I can guess by your goofy smiles that none of you exactly hates them—the play will act as a nice toy for you and the ladies to share. If I actually were a woman, I’d kiss all of you that have beards that pleased me, complexions that I liked, and breath that wasn’t foul. And I’m sure that all of you with nice beards, good faces, and sweet breath will, when I curtsy good night, give me a nice round of applause."
