<p>Upon his visage, and that all the walls</p>
<p>With painted imagery had said at once</p>
<p>“Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!”</p>
<p>Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,</p>
<p>Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed’s neck,</p>
<p>Bespake them thus: “I thank you, countrymen:”</p>

<p>Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke, got on a magnificent horse that seemed to know it was him and kept going in a slow and stately way. All around, people were calling, “God save you, Bolingbroke!” You would have thought the windows themselves were talking. Both old and young people were looking out on him with happy desire, and on the painted walls all around was written, “Jesus protect you! Welcome, Bolingbroke!” Meanwhile, he was turning his head, bare of any helmet and not even as tall as his horse’s neck, and said, “I thank you, countrymen.” And he continued along saying this as he went.</p>

<p>Thinking his prattle to be tedious;</p>
<p>Even so, or with much more contempt, men’s eyes</p>
<p>Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried “God save him!”</p>
<p>No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:</p>
<p>But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:</p>
<p>Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,</p>
<p>His face still combating with tears and smiles,</p>
<p>The badges of his grief and patience,</p>
<p>That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel’d</p>
<p>The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted</p>
<p>And barbarism itself have pitied him.</p>
<p>But heaven hath a hand in these events,</p>

<b>DUKE OF YORK</b>
<p>People looked at him with the dissatisfaction they might have for a supporting actor who comes on stage after the star has left. They stared at him with contempt, and no one cried out, “God save him!” No one welcomed him back. Instead, they threw dust on his sacred head. He shook it off with gentle sorrow, while he both cried and smiled as he wrestled with grief and patience. For some reason God must have hardened everyone’s hearts, otherwise they would have melted so that even a barbarian would have pitied him. But heaven has ordered all this, and we must follow its will. We are Bolingbroke’s subjects now, and I must forever acknowledge his rule and honor.</p>
