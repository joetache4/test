      - "When I have seen by time’s fell hand defaced"
      - "The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;"
      - "When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed,"
      - "And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;"
      - "When I have seen the hungry ocean gain"
      - "Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,"
      - "And the firm soil win of the watery main,"
      - "Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;"
      - "When I have seen such interchange of state,"
      - "Or state itself confounded to decay,"
      - "Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,"
      - "That time will come and take my love away."
      - "  This thought is as a death, which cannot choose"
      - "  But weep to have that which it fears to lose."

      - "Now that I have seen time’s terrible hand deface the costly and splendid monuments of buried men from ages past, and once-lofty towers torn down; now that I have seen even hard brass subject to perpetual destruction by human beings; now that I have seen the hungry ocean swallow up the land and firm land seize territory from the ocean, so that each one’s loss is the other’s gain; now that I have seen that all things constantly change into something else or fall into decay—all this destruction has taught me to think: The time will come in which time will take my love from me. This thought feels like death, and makes me weep over what I have that I’m afraid of losing."
