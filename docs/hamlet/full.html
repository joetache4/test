<b>HORATIO</b>
<p>That can I.</p>
<p>At least, the whisper goes so: our last king,</p>
<p>Whose image even but now appeared to us,</p>
<p>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</p>
<p>Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,</p>
<p>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet</p>
<p>(For so this side of our known world esteemed him)</p>
<p>Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact</p>
<p>Well ratified by law and heraldry,</p>
<p>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</p>
<p>Which he stood seized of to the conqueror,</p>
<p>Against the which a moiety competent</p>
<p>Was gagèd by our king, which had returned</p>
<p>To the inheritance of Fortinbras</p>
<p>Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same covenant</p>
<p>And carriage of the article designed,</p>
<p>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</p>
<p>Of unimprovèd mettle hot and full,</p>
<p>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</p>
<p>Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes,</p>
<p>For food and diet, to some enterprise</p>
<p>That hath a stomach in ’t, which is no other—</p>
<p>As it doth well appear unto our state—</p>
<p>But to recover of us, by strong hand</p>
<p>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</p>
<p>So by his father lost. And this, I take it,</p>
<p>Is the main motive of our preparations,</p>
<p>The source of this our watch, and the chief head</p>
<p>Of this posthaste and rummage in the land.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>HORATIO</b>
<p>I can. Or at least I can describe the rumors. As you know, our late king, whom we just now saw as a ghost, was the great rival of Fortinbras, king of Norway. Fortinbras dared him to battle. In that fight, our courageous Hamlet (or at least that’s how we thought of him) killed old King Fortinbras, who—on the basis of a valid legal document—surrendered all his territories, along with his life, to his conqueror. If our king had lost, he would have had to do the same. But now old Fortinbras’ young son, also called Fortinbras—he is bold, but unproven—has gathered a bunch of thugs from the lawless outskirts of the country. For some food, they’re eager to take on the tough enterprise of securing the lands the elder Fortinbras lost. As far as I understand, that’s why we’re posted here tonight and why there’s such a commotion in Denmark lately.</p>

<p>A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.</p>
<p>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</p>
<p>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</p>

<p>Disasters in the sun, and the moist star</p>

<b>HORATIO</b>
<p>The ghost is definitely something to worry about. In the high and mighty Roman Empire, just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated, corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish. There were shooting stars, and blood mixed in with the morning dew, and threatening signs on the face of the sun. The moon, which controls the tides of the sea, was so eclipsed it almost went completely out. And we’ve had similar omens of terrible things to come, as if heaven and earth have joined together to warn us what’s going to happen.</p>

<p>And then it acted startled, like a guilty person caught by the law. I’ve heard that the rooster awakens the god of day with its trumpetlike crowing, and makes all wandering ghosts, wherever they are, hurry back to their hiding places. We’ve just seen proof of that.</p>

<p>The bird of dawning singeth all night long.</p>
<p>And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad.</p>

<p>Yes, it faded away when the rooster crowed. Some people say that just before Christmas the rooster crows all night long, so that no ghost dares go wandering, and the night is safe. The planets have no sway over us, fairies’ spells don’t work, and witches can’t bewitch us. That’s how holy that night is.</p>

<p>Although I still have fresh memories of my brother the elder Hamlet’s death, and though it was proper to mourn him throughout our kingdom, life still goes on—I think it’s wise to mourn him while also thinking about my own well being. Therefore, I’ve married my former sister-in-law, the queen, with mixed feelings of happiness and sadness. I know that in marrying Gertrude I’m only doing what all of you have wisely advised all along—for which I thank you. Now, down to business. You all know what’s happening. Young Fortinbras, underestimating my strength or imagining that the death of the king has thrown my country into turmoil, dreams of getting the better of me, and never stops pestering me with demands that I surrender the territory his father lost to the elder Hamlet, my dead brother-in-law. So much for Fortinbras.</p>

<p>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</p>
<p>In filial obligation for some term</p>

<p>In obstinate condolement is a course</p>

<p>Why should we in our peevish opposition</p>

<p>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</p>
<p>To reason most absurd, whose common theme</p>
<p>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</p>
<p>From the first corse till he that died today,</p>

<p>You are the most immediate to our throne,</p>

<b>CLAUDIUS</b>
<p>Hamlet, you are so sweet and such a good son to mourn your father like this. But you have to remember, that your father lost his father, who lost his father before him, and every time, each son has had to mourn his father for a certain period. But overdoing it is just stubborn. It’s not manly. It’s not what God wants, and it betrays a vulnerable heart and an ignorant and weak mind. Since we know that everyone must die sooner or later, why should we take it to heart? You’re committing a crime against heaven, against the dead, and against nature. And it’s irration-al, since the truth is that all fathers must die. Please give up this useless mourning of yours and start thinking of me as your new father. Because everyone knows that you are the man closest to this throne, and I love you just as much as any father loves his son. And your plans for going back to Wittenberg are not what I want. I’m asking you now to stay here in my company as the number-one member of my court, my nephew and now my son too.</p>

My father’s only been dead for two months—no, not even two. Such an excellent king, as superior to my uncle as a god is to a beast, and so loving toward my mother that he kept the wind from blowing too hard on her face. Oh God, do I have to remember that? She would hang on to him, and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him; she couldn’t get enough of him. Yet even so, within a month of my father’s death (I don’t even want to think about it. Oh women! You are so weak!), even before she had broken in the shoes she wore to his funeral, crying like crazy—even an animal would have mourned its mate longer than she did!—there she was marrying my uncle, my father’s brother, who’s about as much like my father as I’m like Hercules. Less than a month after my father’s death, even before the tears on her cheeks had dried, she remarried. Oh, so quick to jump into a bed of incest! That’s not good, and no good can come of it either.

<p>After midnight, for two nights running, these two guards, Marcellus and Barnardo, saw a figure that looked very much like your father, in full armor from head to toe. It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times, a staff’s distance from their amazed eyes, while they turned, quaking with fear and too shocked to speak. They told me all about this, so on the third night I agreed to come stand guard with them, to see for myself. It happened again, just as they had described. I knew your father. This ghost looked as much like him as my two hands are like each other.</p>

<p>For nature, crescent, does not grow alone</p>
<p>In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,</p>
<p>The inward service of the mind and soul</p>
<p>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</p>
<p>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</p>
<p>The virtue of his will, but you must fear.</p>
<p>His greatness weighed, his will is not his own,</p>
<p>For he himself is subject to his birth.</p>
<p>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</p>
<p>Carve for himself, for on his choice depends</p>
<p>The safety and health of this whole state.</p>
<p>And therefore must his choice be circumscribed</p>
<p>Unto the voice and yielding of that body</p>
<p>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</p>
<p>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</p>
<p>As he in his particular act and place</p>
<p>May give his saying deed, which is no further</p>
<p>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</p>
<p>Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain</p>
<p>If with too credent ear you list his songs,</p>
<p>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</p>
<p>To his unmastered importunity.</p>
<p>Fear it, Ophelia. Fear it, my dear sister,</p>
<p>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</p>
<p>Out of the shot and danger of desire.</p>
<p>The chariest maid is prodigal enough</p>
<p>If she unmask her beauty to the moon.</p>
<p>Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes.</p>
<p>The canker galls the infants of the spring</p>
<p>Too oft before their buttons be disclosed.</p>
<p>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth,</p>
<p>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</p>
<p>Be wary, then. Best safety lies in fear.</p>
<p>Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>LAERTES</b>
<p>Try to think of it like that, anyway. When a youth grows into a man, he doesn’t just get bigger in his body—his responsibilities grow too. He may love you now, and may have only the best intentions, but you have to be on your guard. Remember that he belongs to the royal family, and his intentions don’t matter that much—he’s a slave to his family obligations. He can’t simply make personal choices for himself the way common people can, since the whole country depends on what he does. His choice has to agree with what the nation wants. So if he says he loves you, you should be wise enough to see that his words only mean as much as the state of Denmark allows them to mean. Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands. Watch out, Ophelia. Just keep your love under control, and don’t let yourself become a target of his lust. Simply exposing your beauty to the moon at night is risky enough—you don’t have to expose yourself to him. Even good girls sometimes get a bad reputation. Worms ruin flowers before they blossom. Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease. So be careful. Fear will keep you safe. Young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others.</p>

<p>You’re still here? Shame on you—get on board! The wind is filling your ship’s sail, and they’re waiting for you. Here, I give you my blessing again. And just try to remember a few rules of life. Don’t say what you’re thinking, and don’t be too quick to act on what you think. Be friendly to people but don’t overdo it. Once you’ve tested out your friends and found them trustworthy, hold onto them. But don’t waste your time shaking hands with every new guy you meet. Don’t be quick to pick a fight, but once you’re in one, hold your own. Listen to many people, but talk to few. Hear everyone’s opinion, but reserve your judgment. Spend all you can afford on clothes, but make sure they’re quality, not flashy, since clothes make the man—which is doubly true in France. Don’t borrow money and don’t lend it, since when you lend to a friend, you often lose the friendship as well as the money, and borrowing turns a person into a spendthrift. And, above all, be true to yourself. Then you won’t be false to anybody else. Good-bye, son. I hope my blessing will help you absorb what I’ve said.</p>

<p>These vows are just traps for stupid birds. I know when a man is on fire, he’ll swear anything. But when a heart’s on fire, it gives out more light than heat, and the fire will be out even before he’s done making his promises. Don’t mistake that for true love. From now on, spend a little less time with him and talk to him less. Make yourself a precious commodity. Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do. In short, Ophelia, don’t believe his love vows, since they’re like flashy pimps who wear nice clothes to lead a woman into filthy acts. To put it plainly, don’t waste your time with Hamlet. Do as I say. Now come along.</p>

<p>This heavy-headed revel east and west</p>

<p>The pith and marrow of our attribute.</p>

<p>Since nature cannot choose his origin),</p>

<p>Their virtues else (be they as pure as grace,</p>

<b>HAMLET</b>
<p>Yes, it is. But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage, I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it. Other countries criticize us for our loud partying. They call us drunks and insult our noble titles. And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements, as great as they are, and lessens our reputations. It’s just like what happens to certain people who have some birth defect (which they are not responsible for, since nobody chooses how he’s born), or some weird habit or compulsion that changes them completely. It happens sometimes that one little defect in these people, as wonderful and talented as they may be, will make them look completely bad to other people. A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations.</p>

<p>Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,</p>
<p>My custom always of the afternoon,</p>
<p>Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole</p>
<p>With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,</p>
<p>And in the porches of my ears did pour</p>
<p>The leperous distilment, whose effect</p>
<p>Holds such an enmity with blood of man</p>
<p>That swift as quicksilver it courses through</p>
<p>The natural gates and alleys of the body</p>
<p>And with a sudden vigor doth posset</p>
<p>And curd, like eager droppings into milk,</p>
<p>The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine.</p>
<p>And a most instant tetter barked about,</p>
<p>Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust</p>
<p>All my smooth body.</p>
<p>Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand</p>
<p>Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,</p>
<p>Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,</p>
<p>Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled.</p>
<p>No reckoning made, but sent to my account</p>
<p>With all my imperfections on my head.</p>
<p>Oh, horrible, oh, horrible, most horrible!</p>
<p>If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.</p>
<p>Let not the royal bed of Denmark be</p>
<p>A couch for luxury and damnèd incest.</p>
<p>But howsoever thou pursuest this act,</p>
<p>Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive</p>
<p>Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven</p>
<p>And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge</p>
<p>To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.</p>
<p>The glowworm shows the matin to be near,</p>
<p>And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire.</p>
<p>Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.</p>

<b>GHOST</b>
<p>Yes, that incestuous, adulterous animal. With his clever words and fancy gifts, he seduced my seemingly virtuous queen, persuading her to give in to his lust. They were evil words and gifts to seduce her like that! Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell! She went from me, who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage, to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine. But just as you can’t corrupt a truly virtuous person no matter how you try, the opposite is also true: a lustful person like her can satisfy herself in a heavenly union and then move on to garbage. But hang on, I think I smell the morning air. So let me be brief here. Your uncle snuck up to me while I was sleeping in the orchard, as I always used to do in the afternoon, and poured a vial of henbane poison into my ear—that poison that moves like quicksilver through the veins and curdles the blood, which is just what it did to me. I broke out in a scaly rash that covered my smooth body with a revolting crust. And that’s how my brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once. He cut me off in the middle of a sinful life. I had no chance to repent my sins or receive last rites. Oh, it’s horrible, horrible, so horrible! If you are human, don’t stand for it. Don’t let the Danish king’s bed be a nest of incest. But however you go about your revenge, don’t corrupt your mind or do any harm to your mother. Leave her to God and her own guilt. Now, good-bye. The glowworm’s light is beginning to fade, so morning is near. Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye. Remember me.</p>

<p>Mark you, your party in converse, him you would sound,</p>
<p>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</p>
<p>The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</p>
<p>He closes with you in this consequence:</p>
<p>“Good sir” or so, or “Friend,” or “Gentleman,”</p>
<p>According to the phrase or the addition</p>
<p>Of man and country.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>POLONIUS</b>
<p>Well, here’s what I’m thinking. (I’m quite proud of myself for coming up with this.) As you talk with someone and hint about my son’s faults and little sins, you’ll watch his reaction, and if he’s ever seen Laertes do any of these things, it will only be natural for him to agree with you, at which point he’ll call you “sir,” or “my good friend,” depending on who the person is, where he comes from, and so on.</p>

<p>“It will be natural for him to agree with you.” Ah, yes, that’s right. If he agrees he’ll say something like this: “Yes, I know the gentleman you’re referring to. I just saw him yesterday,” or “the other day,” or whenever it is, you know, “and there he was gambling,” or “there he was, totally wasted, or fighting with somebody about a tennis match, or going into a house of ill repute”—that means a whorehouse, you know—or whatever. Make sure your little lie brings out the truth. We’re doing this wisely and intelligently, indirectly, finding out things by roundabout means.

I can’t imagine what’s made him so unlike himself, other than his father’s death. Since you both grew up with him and are so familiar with his personality and behavior, I’m asking you to stay a while at court and spend some time with him.

<p>Greetings to you too, your Highness.

He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him, and he ordered Fortinbras’ arrest. Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again. The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand crowns and permission to lead his soldiers into Poland, asking you officially in this letter to allow his troops to pass through your kingdom on their way to Poland.

<p>Madam, I’m doing nothing but sticking to the point. It’s true he’s crazy, and it’s a shame it’s true, and it’s truly a shame he’s crazy—but now I sound foolish, so I’ll get right to the point. Now, if we agree Hamlet’s crazy, then the next step is to figure out the cause of this effect of craziness, or I suppose I should say the cause of this defect, since this defective effect is caused by something. This is what we must do, and that’s exactly what needs to be done. Think about it. I have a daughter (I have her until she gets married) who’s given me this letter, considering it her duty. Listen and think about this: <em>(he reads a letter)</em> “To the heavenly idol of my soul, the most beautified Ophelia”—By the way, “beautified” sounds bad, it sounds awful, it sounds crude, it’s a terrible use of the word. But I’ll go on: <em>(he reads the letter)</em> “In her excellent white bosom,” et cetera, et cetera—you don’t need to hear all this stuff—</p>

My dear queen, what would you have thought of me if I had turned a blind eye to what was happening between Hamlet and my daughter? No, I had to do something. And so I said to my daughter: “Lord Hamlet is a prince, he’s out of your league. You have to end this.” And then I gave her orders to stay away from him, and not to accept any messages or little gifts from him. She did what I said. When she rejected Hamlet, he became sad, and stopped eating, stopped sleeping, got weak, got dizzy, and as a result lost his mind. And that’s why he’s crazy now, and all of us feel sorry for him.</p>

<p>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted. Or, if it was, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million. ’Twas caviary to the general. But it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido and thereabout of it, especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line—Let me see, let me see—</p>
<p><em>The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast</em>—</p>
<p>It is not so. It begins with Pyrrhus—</p>
<p><em>The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms</em>,</p>
<p><em>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</em></p>
<p><em>When he lay couchèd in the ominous horse</em>,</p>
<p><em>Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared</em></p>
<p><em>With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot</em></p>
<p><em>Now is he total gules, horridly tricked</em></p>
<p><em>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons</em>,</p>
<p><em>Baked and impasted with the parching streets</em>,</p>
<p><em>That lend a tyrannous and damnèd light</em></p>
<p><em>To their lord’s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire</em>,</p>
<p><em>And thus o’ersizèd with coagulate gore</em>,</p>
<p><em>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</em></p>
<p><em>Old grandsire Priam seeks</em>.</p>

<p>I heard you recite a speech for me once that was never acted out, or if it was, it was performed only once, since the play was not popular—like caviar for a slob who couldn’t appreciate it. But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play, with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy. I remember one critic said there was no vulgar language to spice up the dialogue, and showing off on playwright’s part. That critic called it an excellent play, containing things to reflect upon as well as sweet music to enjoy. I loved one speech in particular. It was when Aeneas told Dido about Priam’s murder. If you happen to remember this scene, begin at line—let me see, how does it go?</p>
<p><em>The ruggedPyrrhus,strong as a tiger—</em></p>
<p>No, that’s wrong; it begins like this:</p>
<p><em>Savage Pyrrhus, whose black armor was</em></p>
<p><em>As dark plans, and was like the night</em></p>
<p><em>When he crouched inside the Trojan Horse</em>,</p>
<p><em>Has now smeared his dark armor</em></p>
<p><em>With something worse. From head to foot</em></p>
<p><em>He’s now covered in red, decorated horribly</em></p>
<p><em>With the blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons</em>.</p>
<p><em>The blood is baked to a paste by fires he set in the streets</em>,</p>
<p><em>Fires that lend a terrible light to his horrible murders</em>.</p>
<p><em>Boiling with anger and fire</em>,</p>
<p><em>And coated thick with hard-baked blood</em>,</p>

<p>Now I am alone.</p>
<p>Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</p>
<p>Is it not monstrous that this player here,</p>
<p>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</p>
<p>Could force his soul so to his own conceit</p>
<p>That from her working all his visage wanned,</p>
<p>Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,</p>
<p>A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</p>
<p>With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing—</p>
<p>For Hecuba!</p>
<p>What’s Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba</p>
<p>That he should weep for her? What would he do</p>
<p>Had he the motive and the cue for passion</p>
<p>That I have? He would drown the stage with tears</p>
<p>And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,</p>
<p>Make mad the guilty and appall the free,</p>
<p>Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed</p>
<p>The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,</p>
<p>A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak</p>
<p>Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,</p>
<p>And can say nothing—no, not for a king,</p>
<p>Upon whose property and most dear life</p>
<p>A damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?</p>
<p>Who calls me “villain”? Breaks my pate across?</p>
<p>Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?</p>
<p>Tweaks me by the nose? Gives me the lie i’ th’ throat</p>
<p>As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>’Swounds, I should take it, for it cannot be</p>
<p>But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall</p>
<p>To make oppression bitter, or ere this</p>
<p>I should have fatted all the region kites</p>
<p>With this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!</p>
<p>Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!</p>
<p>O vengeance!</p>
<p>Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,</p>
<p>That I, the son of a dear father murdered,</p>
<p>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,</p>
<p>Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words</p>
<p>And fall a-cursing like a very drab,</p>
<p>A scullion! Fie upon ’t, foh!</p>
<p>About, my brain.—Hum, I have heard</p>
<p>That guilty creatures sitting at a play</p>
<p>Have, by the very cunning of the scene,</p>
<p>Been struck so to the soul that presently</p>
<p>They have proclaimed their malefactions.</p>
<p>For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak</p>
<p>With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players</p>
<p>Play something like the murder of my father</p>
<p>Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks.</p>
<p>I’ll tent him to the quick. If he do blench,</p>
<p>I know my course. The spirit that I have seen</p>
<p>May be the devil, and the devil hath power</p>
<p>T’ assume a pleasing shape. Yea, and perhaps</p>
<p>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</p>
<p>As he is very potent with such spirits,</p>
<p>Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds</p>
<p>More relative than this. The play’s the thing</p>
<p>Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<p>Now I’m alone. Oh, what a mean low-life I am! It’s awful that this actor could force his soul to feel made-up feelings in a work of make-believe. He grew pale, shed real tears, became overwhelmed, his voice breaking with feeling and his whole being, even, meeting the needs of his act—and all for nothing. For Hecuba! What is Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, that he would weep for her? Just imagine what he would do if he had the cause for feeling that I do. He would drown the stage with his tears and burst the audience’s ears with his terrible words, drive the guilty spectators crazy, terrify the innocent ones, confuse the ignorant ones, and astound absolutely everyone’s eyes and ears. But what do I, a grim and uncourageous rascal, do? Mope around like a dreamer, not even bothering with plans for revenge, and I can say nothing—nothing at all—on behalf of a king whose dear life was stolen. Am I a coward? Is there anyone out there who’ll call me “villain” and slap me hard? Pull off my beard? Pinch my nose? Call me the worst liar? By God, if someone would do that to me, I’d take it, because I’m a lily-livered man—otherwise, I would’ve fattened up the local vultures with the intestines of that low-life king a long time ago. Bloody, inhuman villain! Remorseless, treacherous, sex-obsessed, unnatural villain! Ah, revenge! What an ass I am. I’m so damn brave. My dear father’s been murdered, and I’ve been urged to seek revenge by heaven and hell, and yet all I can do is stand around cursing like a whore in the streets. Damn it! I need to get myself together here! Hmm…. I’ve heard that guilty people watching a play have been so affected by the artistry of the scene that they are driven to confess their crimes out loud. Murder has no tongue, but miraculously it still finds a way to speak. I’ll have these actors perform something like my father’s murder in front of my uncle. I’ll watch my uncle. I’ll probe his conscience and see if he flinches. If he becomes pale, I know what to do. The ghost I saw may be the devil, and the devil has the power to assume a pleasing disguise, and so he may be taking advantage of my weakness and sadness to bring about my damnation. I need better evidence than the ghost to work with. The play’s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king.</p>

<p>To be, or not to be? That is the question—</p>
<p>Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p>
<p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p>
<p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</p>
<p>And, by opposing, end them? To die, to sleep—</p>
<p>No more—and by a sleep to say we end</p>
<p>The heartache and the thousand natural shocks</p>
<p>That flesh is heir to—’tis a consummation</p>
<p>Devoutly to be wished! To die, to sleep.</p>
<p>To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub,</p>
<p>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come</p>
<p>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p>
<p>Must give us pause. There’s the respect</p>
<p>That makes calamity of so long life.</p>
<p>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</p>
<p>Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,</p>
<p>The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,</p>
<p>The insolence of office, and the spurns</p>
<p>That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,</p>
<p>When he himself might his quietus make</p>
<p>With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,</p>
<p>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</p>
<p>But that the dread of something after death,</p>
<p>The undiscovered country from whose bourn</p>
<p>No traveler returns, puzzles the will</p>
<p>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</p>
<p>Than fly to others that we know not of?</p>
<p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</p>
<p>And thus the native hue of resolution</p>
<p>Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,</p>
<p>And enterprises of great pith and moment</p>
<p>With this regard their currents turn awry,</p>
<p>And lose the name of action.—Soft you now,</p>
<p>The fair Ophelia!—Nymph, in thy orisons</p>
<p>Be all my sins remembered.</p>

<p>The question is: is it better to be alive or dead? Is it nobler to put up with all the nasty things that luck throws your way, or to fight against all those troubles by simply putting an end to them once and for all? Dying, sleeping—that’s all dying is—a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us—that’s an achievement to wish for. To die, to sleep—to sleep, maybe to dream. Ah, but there’s the catch: in death’s sleep who knows what kind of dreams might come, after we’ve put the noise and commotion of life behind us. That’s certainly something to worry about. That’s the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long. After all, who would put up with all life’s humiliations—the abuse from superiors, the insults of arrogant men, the pangs of unrequited love, the inefficiency of the legal system, the rudeness of people in office, and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad—when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits? Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life, unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death, the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns, which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don’t? Fear of death makes us all cowards, and our natural boldness becomes weak with too much thinking. Actions that should be carried out at once get misdirected, and stop being actions at all. But <em>shh</em>, here comes the beautiful Ophelia. Pretty lady, please remember me when you pray.</p>

Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus, but use all gently, for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. Oh, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise.

Don’t use too many hand gestures; just do a few, gently, like this. When you get into a whirlwind of passion on stage, remember to keep the emotion moderate and smooth. I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds, bursting everyone’s eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse, who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows. I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical. That’s as bad as those old plays in which King Herod ranted. Please avoid doing that.</p>

<p>Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature. For anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is to hold, as ’twere, the mirror up to nature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone or come tardy off, though it make the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve, the censure of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. Oh, there be players that I have seen play and heard others praise (and that highly), not to speak it profanely, that, neither having th’ accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</p>

<p>But don’t be too tame, either—let your good sense guide you. Fit the action to the word and the word to the action. Act natural at all costs. Exaggeration has no place in the theater, where the purpose is to represent reality, holding a mirror up to virtue, to vice, and to the spirit of the times. If you handle this badly, it just makes ignorant people laugh while regular theater-goers are miserable—and they’re the ones you should be keeping happy. I’ve seen actors who are highly praised, but who—not to be too rude here—can’t even talk or walk like human beings. They bellow and strut about like weird animals that were made to look like men, but very badly.</p>

Blessed are those who mix emotion with reason in just the right proportion, making them strong enough to resist the whims of Lady Luck. Show me the person who’s master of his emotions, and I’ll put him close to my heart—in my heart of hearts—as I do you. But I’m talking too much. The point is, there’s a play being performed for the king tonight. One of the scenes comes very close to depicting the circumstances of my father’s death, as I described them to you. Watch my uncle carefully when that scene begins. If his guilty secret does not reveal itself, then that ghost was just a devil, and my hunch wasn’t, in fact, worth anything. Watch him closely. I’ll stare at him too, and afterward we’ll compare notes on him.</p>

<p><em>I know that’s what you think now, but people change their minds. Often our intentions are strong at first, but as time goes on they weaken, just like an apple sticks to the tree when it is unripe but falls to the ground once it ripens. The promises we make to ourselves in emotional moments lose their power once the emotion passes. Great grief and joy may rouse us to action, but when the grief or joy have passed, we’re no longer motivated to act. Joy turns to grief in the blink of an eye, and grief becomes joy just as quickly. This world is not made for either one to last long in, and it’s no surprise that even our loves change along with our luck. It’s still a mystery to be solved whether luck controls love, or love controls luck. When a great man has a run of bad luck, watch how followers desert him, and when a poor man advances to an important position, he makes friends with the people he used to hate. Love is unreliable. A person with lots of money will always have friends, while one fallen on hard times makes an enemy of any friend he turns to for money. But back to my original point—what we want and what we get are always at odds. We can have our little dreams, but the fates decide our futures. You think now you’ll never remarry, but that thought will die with me, your first husband</em>.</p>

<p>Everyone tries to avoid harm, but the public figure demands even more protection. When a great leader dies he doesn’t die alone but, like a whirlpool, draws others with him. He’s like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things—when it falls down the mountain, every little object goes down with it. Whenever a king sighs, everyone groans.</p>

Up there, every action is judged for exactly what it’s worth, and we’re forced to confront our crimes. So what can I do? What is there left to do? Offer whatever repentance I can—that couldn’t hurt. But it can’t help either! Oh, what a lousy situation I’m in. My heart’s as black as death. My soul is stuck to sin, and the more it struggles to break free, the more it sticks. Help me, angels!

He killed my father when my father was enjoying life, with all his sins in full bloom, before my father could repent for any of them. Only God knows how many sins my father has to pay for. As for me, I don’t think his prospects look so good. So is it really revenge for me if I kill Claudius right when he is confessing his sins, in perfect condition for a trip to heaven? No. Away, sword, and wait for a better moment to kill him. <em>(he puts his sword away)</em> When he’s sleeping off some drunken orgy, or having incestuous sex, or swearing while he gambles, or committing some other act that has no goodness about it—that’s when I’ll trip him up and send him to hell with his heels kicking up at heaven. My mother’s waiting. The king’s trying to cure himself with prayer, but all he’s doing is keeping himself alive a little longer.</p>

<p>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed</p>

<p>Look at this picture here, and that one there, the painted images of two brothers. Look how kind and gentlemanly this one is, with his curly hair and his forehead like a Greek god. His eye could command like the god of war. His body is as agile as Mercury just landing on a high hill. A figure and a combination of good qualities that seemed like every god had set his stamp on this man. That was your husband. Now look at this other one. Here is your present husband, like a mildewed ear of corn infecting the healthy one next to it. Do you have eyes? How could you leave the lofty heights of this man here and descend as low as this one? Ha! Do you have eyes? You cannot say you did it out of love, since at your age romantic passions have grown weak, and the heart obeys reason. But what reason could move you from this one to that one? You must have some sense in your head, since you’re able to get around, but it seems to be paralyzed, since even if you were crazy you would know the difference between these two men. No one ever went so insane that they couldn’t get an easy choice like this one right. What devil was it that blindfolded you? Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, ears without hands or eyes, smell without anything else, the use of even one impaired sense would not permit such a mistake as yours. Oh, for shame, why aren’t you blushing? If evil can overtake even an old mother’s bones, then let it melt my own.

God didn’t create us with such a huge power of thought and a divine capacity for reason in order for us not to use them. Now, whether it’s animal-like mindlessness, or the cowardly hesitation that comes from thinking too much (thinking thoughts that are one part wisdom, three parts cowardice), I don’t know why I’m still alive to say “I have to do this deed” rather than having done it already. I have the motivation, the willpower, the ability, and the means to do it. It’s as plain as the ground beneath my feet that I must do it. Look at this massive army led by a delicate and tender prince who’s so puffed up with divine ambition that he puts his fragile life at risk, exposing it to danger and death, for a reason as thin as an eggshell. To be truly great doesn’t mean you’d only fight for a good reason. It means you’d fight over nothing if your honor was at stake. So where does that leave me, whose father has been murdered and mother defiled, ignoring these mental and emotional provocations and letting well enough alone? Meanwhile, to my shame, I watch twenty thousand men go marching to their deaths for an illusion and a little bit of fame, fighting for a tiny piece of land not even big enough to bury them all. From now on, if my thoughts aren’t violent I’ll consider them worthless.</p>

First her father was killed, then your son was taken away—because of his own violent actions. The people are confused and spreading nasty rumors about Polonius’ death, and I was a fool to bury him in a hurry, without a proper state funeral. Poor Ophelia has been robbed of her sanity, without which we’re just pictures, or animals. Last but not least, her brother has secretly returned from France and is surrounded by gossip-mongers, who fill his ears with wicked stories about his father’s death. Deprived of proper evidence, he’ll naturally attribute the murder to me. Oh, dear Gertrude, I feel as though I’m being murdered many times over.</p>

<p>Not that I suspect you didn’t love your father, but I’ve seen it happen that, as the days go by, time dampens the flame of love. The fire of love always burns itself out, and nothing stays the way it began. Even a good thing can grow too big and die from its own excess. We should do what we intend to do right when we intend it, since our intentions are subject to as many weakenings and delays as there are words in the dictionary and accidents in life. And then all our “woulds” and “shoulds” are nothing but hot air. But back to my point: Hamlet’s coming back. What proof will you offer—in action, not just words—that you’re your father’s son?</p>

<p>There’s a willow that leans over the brook, dangling its white leaves over the glassy water. Ophelia made wild wreaths out of those leaves, braiding in crowflowers, thistles, daisies, and the orchises that vulgar shepherds have an obscene name for, but which pure-minded girls call “dead men’s fingers.” Climbing into the tree to hang the wreath of weeds on the hanging branches, she and her flowers fell into the gurgling brook. Her clothes spread out wide in the water, and buoyed her up for a while as she sang bits of old hymns, acting like someone who doesn’t realize the danger she’s in, or like someone completely accustomed to danger. But it was only a matter of time before her clothes, heavy with the water they absorbed, pulled the poor thing out of her song, down into the mud at the bottom of the brook.</p>

<p>There’s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillities, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in ’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box, and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?</p>

<p>There’s another. Could that be a lawyer’s skull? Where’s all his razzle-dazzle legal jargon now? Why does he allow this idiot to knock him on the head with a dirty shovel, instead of suing him for assault and battery? Maybe this guy was once a great landowner, with his deeds and contracts, his tax shelters and his annuities. Is it part of his deed of ownership to have his skull filled up with dirt? Does he only get to keep as much land as a set of contracts would cover if you spread them out on the ground? The deeds to his properties would barely fit in this coffin—and the coffin’s all the property he gets to keep?</p>
