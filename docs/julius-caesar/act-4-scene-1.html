<p>Octavius, I have seen more days than you.</p>

<p>He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,</p>
<p>To groan and sweat under the business,</p>
<p>Either led or driven, as we point the way.</p>
<p>And having brought our treasure where we will,</p>

<p>Octavius, I’m older than you are. And although we’re giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we’re doing, he’ll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold—groaning and sweating under the load, either led or pushed, as we direct him. Once he’s carried our treasure where we want it, we’ll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass, to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures.</p>

<p>So is my horse, Octavius, and for that</p>
<p>I do appoint him store of provender.</p>
<p>It is a creature that I teach to fight,</p>
<p>To wind, to stop, to run directly on,</p>
<p>His corporal motion governed by my spirit,</p>
<p>And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so.</p>
<p>He must be taught and trained and bid go forth,</p>
<p>A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds</p>
<p>On objects, arts, and imitations,</p>
<p>Which, out of use and staled by other men,</p>
<p>Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him</p>
<p>But as a property. And now, Octavius,</p>
<p>Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius</p>
<p>Are levying powers. We must straight make head.</p>
<p>Therefore let our alliance be combined,</p>
<p>Our best friends made, our means stretched.</p>
<p>And let us presently go sit in council</p>
<p>How covert matters may be best disclosed,</p>
<p>And open perils surest answered.</p>

<b>ANTONY</b>
<p>So is my horse, Octavius, and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants. But my horse is a creature that <em>I</em> teach to fight—to turn, to stop, to run in a straight line. I govern the motion of his body. And in some ways, Lepidus is just like that. He has to be taught and trained and told to go forward. He’s an empty man, who pays attention to fashions and tastes that other men took up and got tired of long ago. Don’t think about Lepidus except as a means to an end. And now, Octavius, listen to more important things. Brutus and Cassius are raising armies. We have to raise our own immediately. So, we should combine forces and organize our allies, pull together our friends, and stretch our resources as far as they’ll go. Let’s immediately organize a council to discuss the best way to find out their secrets and the safest way to confront the threats we’re already faced with.</p>

<p>Let us do so. For we are at the stake</p>
<p>And bayed about with many enemies.</p>
<p>And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,</p>
<p>Millions of mischiefs.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>OCTAVIUS</b>
<p>Let’s do that, because we’re hemmed in by many enemies. And even some of the people who smile at us are in fact plotting against us, I’m afraid.</p>
