<p>But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?</p>

<p>Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,</p>
<p>Who is already sick and pale with grief,</p>
<p>That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.</p>
<p>Be not her maid since she is envious.</p>

<p>It is my lady. Oh, it is my love.</p>
<p>Oh, that she knew she were!</p>
<p>She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?</p>
<p>Her eye discourses. I will answer it.—</p>
<p>I am too bold. ’Tis not to me she speaks.</p>
<p>Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,</p>
<p>Having some business, do entreat her eyes</p>
<p>To twinkle in their spheres till they return.</p>
<p>What if her eyes were there, they in her head?</p>
<p>The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars</p>
<p>As daylight doth a lamp. Her eye in heaven</p>
<p>Would through the airy region stream so bright</p>
<p>That birds would sing and think it were not night.</p>

<p>But wait, what’s that light in the window over there? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Rise up, beautiful sun, and kill the jealous moon. The moon is already sick and pale with grief because you, Juliet, her maid, are more beautiful than she. Don’t be her maid, because she is jealous. Virginity makes her look sick and green. Only fools hold on to their virginity. Let it go. Oh, there’s my lady! Oh, it is my love. Oh, I wish she knew how much I love her. She’s talking, but she’s not saying anything. So what? Her eyes are saying something. I will answer them. I am too bold. She’s not talking to me. Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business, and they’re asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return. What if her eyes were in the sky and the stars were in her head?—The brightness of her cheeks would outshine the stars the way the sun outshines a lamp. If her eyes were in the night sky, they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing, thinking her light was the light of day. Look how she leans her hand on her cheek. Oh, I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek.</p>

But forget about good manners. Do you love me? I know you’ll say “yes,” and I’ll believe you. But if you swear you love me, you might turn out to be lying. They say Jove laughs when lovers lie to each other. Oh Romeo, if you really love me, say it truly. Or if you think it’s too easy and quick to win my heart, I’ll frown and play hard-to-get, as long as that will make you try to win me, but otherwise I wouldn’t act that way for anything. In truth, handsome Montague, I like you too much, so you may think my behavior is loose. But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove myself more faithful than girls who act coy and play hard-to-get. I should have been more standoffish, I confess, but you overheard me talking about the love in my heart when I didn’t know you were there. So excuse me, and do not assume that because you made me love you so easily my love isn’t serious.</p>

<b>JULIET</b>
<p>Hist, Romeo! Hist! Oh, I wish I could make a falconer’s call, so I could bring my little falcon back again. I’m trapped in my family’s house, so I must be quiet. Otherwise I would rip open the cave where Echo sleeps. I would make her repeat his name until her voice grew more hoarse than mine by repeating, “My Romeo!”</p>

<p>It is my soul that calls upon my name.</p>
<p>How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,</p>
<p>Like softest music to attending ears!</p>

<b>ROMEO</b>
<p>My soul is calling out my name. The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet. It’s the sweetest sound a lover ever hears.</p>
