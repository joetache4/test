<p>My liege, I did deny no prisoners.</p>
<p>But I remember, when the fight was done,</p>
<p>When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,</p>
<p>Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,</p>
<p>Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dressed,</p>
<p>Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reaped</p>
<p>Showed like a stubble land at harvest home.</p>
<p>He was perfumèd like a milliner,</p>
<p>And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held</p>
<p>A pouncet box, which ever and anon</p>
<p>He gave his nose and took ’t away again,</p>
<p>Who therewith angry, when it next came there,</p>
<p>Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talked.</p>
<p>And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,</p>
<p>He called them untaught knaves, unmannerly,</p>
<p>To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse</p>
<p>Betwixt the wind and his nobility.</p>
<p>With many holiday and lady terms</p>
<p>He questioned me; amongst the rest demanded</p>
<p>My prisoners in your Majesty’s behalf.</p>
<p>I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,</p>
<p>To be so pestered with a popinjay,</p>
<p>Out of my grief and my impatience</p>
<p>Answered neglectingly I know not what—</p>
<p>He should, or he should not; for he made me mad</p>
<p>To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet</p>
<p>And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman</p>
<p>Of guns, and drums, and wounds—God save the mark!—</p>
<p>And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth</p>
<p>Was parmacety for an inward bruise,</p>
<p>And that it was great pity, so it was,</p>
<p>This villanous saltpeter should be digged</p>
<p>Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,</p>
<p>Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed</p>
<p>So cowardly, and but for these vile guns</p>
<p>He would himself have been a soldier.</p>
<p>This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,</p>
<p>I answered indirectly, as I said,</p>
<p>And I beseech you, let not his report</p>
<p>Come current for an accusation</p>
<p>Betwixt my love and your high Majesty.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>HOTSPUR</b>
<p>Sir, I didn’t hold back any prisoners. But I remember this: when the battle ended, I was exhausted with rage and exertion. I was out of breath, dizzy and bent over. All of a sudden a man approached me, neat, clean, and tidily dressed, like a bridegroom. His beard was freshly shaven, like a newly plowed field. He wore fancy cologne and he carried a perfume box, which he kept raising to his nose as he smiled and talked on. Whenever soldiers walked past, bearing dead bodies, he called them rude hoodlums for bringing a foul, disgusting corpse within breathing distance of him. He interrogated me, with his fancy language, and demanded that I give him my prisoners, to be taken on your behalf. There I was, with the cold aggravating all my wounds, being pestered by this idiot. In my grief and impatience, I gave him some kind of answer. I don’t even remember what I said—he could take them, or he couldn’t. I was so angry, looking at him all shiny and sweet-smelling, and speaking like a squeamish woman about guns and battle drums and wounds—God almighty! —and telling me the best thing for an injury is parmaceti, and that it was a shame that the blameless earth had to be dug up to find saltpeter for the gunpowder, when so many good, brave men had been cowardly destroyed by guns, and that if it hadn’t been for those disgusting guns, he would have been a soldier himself. All this trivial, incoherent talk I answered offhandedly, as I’ve already told you. So I beg you: please don’t take his word as evidence that there’s anything wrong between you and me, your Majesty.</p>

And now we hear that Mortimer has married Glendower’s daughter! Should the treasury be emptied to ransom a traitor? Should I pay for treason, and bargain for a coward, when it was Mortimer who lost himself? No. Let him starve in the wilderness. No man who asks me to spend one penny on that traitor Mortimer can ever be a friend of mine.</p>

<p>He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,</p>
<p>But by the chance of war. To prove that true</p>
<p>Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,</p>
<p>Those mouthèd wounds, which valiantly he took</p>
<p>When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank</p>
<p>In single opposition hand to hand</p>
<p>He did confound the best part of an hour</p>
<p>In changing hardiment with great Glendower.</p>
<p>Three times they breathed, and three times did they drink,</p>
<p>Upon agreement, of swift Severn’s flood,</p>
<p>Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,</p>
<p>Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds</p>
<p>And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,</p>
<p>Bloodstainèd with these valiant combatants.</p>
<p>Never did bare and rotten policy</p>
<p>Color her working with such deadly wounds,</p>
<p>Nor could the noble Mortimer</p>
<p>Receive so many, and all willingly.</p>
<p>Then let not him be slandered with revolt.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>HOTSPUR</b>
<p>“That traitor Mortimer!” He never faltered, my lord, except through an accident of war. I’ll prove it, by speaking about the many wounds he heroically suffered when he spent an hour in brutal hand-to-hand combat against Glendower on the grassy banks of the Severn River. They broke three times from fighting, and they drank three times from the Severn. The river itself was frightened by their horrible looks. Its water became discolored with the blood of these brave fighters, and the Severn ran off, as if to hide itself in the weeds on its banks. Treachery has never used deadly wounds to cover its operations, and Mortimer could never have willingly suffered so many injuries. Do not let him be slandered by calling him a traitor.</p>

<p>Yes, I will; there’s no doubt about it. The King said he would not pay ransom for Mortimer. He forbid me from speaking of Mortimer.
