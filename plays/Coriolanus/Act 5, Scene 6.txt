      - "Deliver them this paper: having read it,"
      - "Bid them repair to the market-place; where I,"
      - "Even in theirs and in the commons’ ears,"
      - "Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse"
      - "The city ports by this hath enter’d and"
      - "Intends to appear before the people, hoping"
      - "To purge herself with words: dispatch."
    m:
      - "Go tell the lords of the city that I’m here. Give them this paper. Once they’ve read it, ask them to go to the marketplace. I’ll be there to confirm its truthfulness for them and for the common people. He whom I accuse has entered through the city’s gates and intends to appear before the people, hoping to explain himself with words. Hurry."

    ms: "Three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS’ faction enter."

  - o:
      - "Most welcome!"
    m:
      - "Most welcome!"

  - sp: FIRST CONSPIRATOR
    o:
      - "How is it with our general?"
    m:
      - "How are you, general?"

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "Even so"
      - "As with a man by his own alms empoison’d,"
      - "And with his charity slain."
    m:
      - "Like a man destroyed by his own kindness and killed by his compassion."

  - sp: SECOND CONSPIRATOR
    o:
      - "Most noble sir,"
      - "If you do hold the same intent wherein"
      - "You wish’d us parties, we’ll deliver you"
      - "Of your great danger."
    m:
      - "Most noble sir, if you still want to work together, we’ll rid you of your great threat."

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "Sir, I cannot tell:"
      - "We must proceed as we do find the people."
    m:
      - "Sir, I don’t know yet. We must see how the people react."

  - sp: THIRD CONSPIRATOR
    o:
      - "The people will remain uncertain whilst"
      - "’Twixt you there’s difference; but the fall of either"
      - "Makes the survivor heir of all."
    m:
      - "The people won’t know how to react if there’s no rivalry between you two, but whoever loses leaves the other man with power over everything."

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "I know it;"
      - "And my pretext to strike at him admits"
      - "A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn’d"
      - "Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten’d,"
      - "He water’d his new plants with dews of flattery,"
      - "Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,"
      - "He bow’d his nature, never known before"
      - "But to be rough, unswayable and free."
    m:
      - "I know, and my reason for attacking him is well founded. I put him in this position of power, and I sacrificed my honor for his loyalty. He became so highly esteemed that he watered his new plants with the dew of flattery. He seduced my friends by changing his nature—he was never known before as anything other than rough, unswayable, and unrestrained."

  - sp: THIRD CONSPIRATOR
    o:
      - "Sir, his stoutness"
      - "When he did stand for consul, which he lost"
      - "By lack of stooping,—"
    m:
      - "Sir, his stubbornness when he was being considered for consul is why he lost. He wouldn’t humble himself."

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "That I would have spoke of:"
      - "Being banish’d for’t, he came unto my hearth;"
      - "Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;"
      - "Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way"
      - "In all his own desires; nay, let him choose"
      - "Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,"
      - "My best and freshest men; served his designments"
      - "In mine own person; holp to reap the fame"
      - "Which he did end all his; and took some pride"
      - "To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,"
      - "I seem’d his follower, not partner, and"
      - "He waged me with his countenance, as if"
      - "I had been mercenary."
    m:
      - "That’s what I was about to say: being banished for his stubbornness, he came to my house and put my knife to his throat. I took him in, made him joint commander of my army, let him do whatever he wanted. I even let him choose men from among my soldiers to carry out his agenda—my best and freshest men. I served his vision myself, helped him do the deeds that he took all the credit for. He wronged me in becoming so prideful. In the end, I looked like his follower, not his partner, and he treated me like I was just a soldier-for-hire."

  - sp: FIRST CONSPIRATOR
    o:
      - "So he did, my lord:"
      - "The army marvell’d at it, and, in the last,"
      - "When he had carried Rome and that we look’d"
      - "For no less spoil than glory,—"
    m:
      - "That’s what he did, my lord. The army was astonished by it. And finally, when he was able to conquer Rome and we could have had the spoils and glory—"

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "There was it:"
      - "For which my sinews shall be stretch’d upon him."
      - "At a few drops of women’s rheum, which are"
      - "As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour"
      - "Of our great action: therefore shall he die,"
      - "And I’ll renew me in his fall. But, hark!"
    m:
      - "That’s why I’ll use all my strength against him. He sold us out, forfeiting the blood and labor of our great plan because of a few drops of women’s tears, which are as worthless as lies. Therefore he must die, and I’ll reassert my power by taking him down. But look!"

  - os: "Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the People"
    ms: "Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the people."

  - sp: FIRST CONSPIRATOR
    o:
      - "Your native town you enter’d like a post,"
      - "And had no welcomes home: but he returns,"
      - "Splitting the air with noise."
    m:
      - "You returned home like a messenger—you weren’t properly welcomed. But he comes back to a loud celebration."

  - sp: SECOND CONSPIRATOR
    o:
      - "And patient fools,"
      - "Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear"
      - "With giving him glory."
    m:
      - "And ignorant fools, whose children he has killed, tear their stupid throats as they sing his praises."

  - sp: THIRD CONSPIRATOR
    o:
      - "Therefore, at your vantage,"
      - "Ere he express himself, or move the people"
      - "With what he would say, let him feel your sword,"
      - "Which we will second. When he lies along,"
      - "After your way his tale pronounced shall bury"
      - "His reasons with his body."
    m:
      - "Seize your opportunity now, before he speaks and convinces the people with whatever he plans to say. Let him feel your sword—we support you. When he lies dead, you can tell the people what he did from your perspective. His version of the story will be buried along with his body."

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "Say no more:"
      - "Here come the lords."
    m:
      - "Say no more. Here come the lords."

  - os: "Enter the Lords of the city"
    ms: "The Lords of the city enter."

  - sp: ALL THE LORDS
    o:
      - "You are most welcome home."
    m:
      - "This celebration welcomes you home."

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "I have not deserved it."
      - "But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused"
      - "What I have written to you?"
    m:
      - "I don’t deserve it. But, worthy lords, have you carefully read the letter I wrote you?"

  - sp: LORDS
    o:
      - "We have."
    m:
      - "We have."

  - sp: FIRST LORD
    o:
      - "And grieve to hear’t."
      - "What faults he made before the last, I think"
      - "Might have found easy fines: but there to end"
      - "Where he was to begin and give away"
      - "The benefit of our levies, answering us"
      - "With our own charge, making a treaty where"
      - "There was a yielding,—this admits no excuse."
    m:
      - "And we’re sad to hear it. Whatever mistakes he made before this last one, I think we could have forgiven with light punishment. But stopping the attack when it was about to begin, squandering the advantage of our army’ position, leaving us to pay the cost of raising that army, and making a peace treaty when the enemy was weak and could have been conquered—there’s no excuse for this."

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "He approaches: you shall hear him."
    m:
      - "Here he comes. You’ll hear how he tells it."

  - os: "Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours; commoners being with him"
    ms: "CORIOLANUS enters, marching with drum and colors; commoners enter with him."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Hail, lords! I am return’d your soldier,"
      - "No more infected with my country’s love"
      - "Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting"
      - "Under your great command. You are to know"
      - "That prosperously I have attempted and"
      - "With bloody passage led your wars even to"
      - "The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home"
      - "Do more than counterpoise a full third part"
      - "The charges of the action. We have made peace"
      - "With no less honour to the Antiates"
      - "Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,"
      - "Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,"
      - "Together with the seal o’ the senate, what"
      - "We have compounded on."
    m:
      - "Hail, lords! I have returned as your soldier, no more loyal to my country than when I left here. I remain under your great command. You should know that I have successfully won the bloody battles that brought your army to the gates of Rome. The spoils we’ve brought home outweigh the bodies of those we killed by more than a third. We’ve made peace, which brings honor to the people of Antium as much as it shames the people of Rome. And we here present, signed by the Roman consuls and patricians, and with the seal of the Senate, the treaty we’ve agreed to."

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "Read it not, noble lords;"
      - "But tell the traitor, in the high’st degree"
      - "He hath abused your powers."
    m:
      - "Don’t read it, noble lords. Instead, tell the traitor that he has abused your powers to the highest degree."

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Traitor! how now!"
    m:
      - "Traitor! How’s that?"

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "Ay, traitor, Martius!"
    m:
      - "Yes, traitor, Martius!"

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Martius!"
    m:
      - "“Martius”!"

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "Ay, Martius, Caius Martius: dost thou think"
      - "I’ll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol’n name"
      - "Coriolanus in Corioli?"
      - "You lords and heads o’ the state, perfidiously"
      - "He has betray’d your business, and given up,"
      - "For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,"
      - "I say “your city,” to his wife and mother;"
      - "Breaking his oath and resolution like"
      - "A twist of rotten silk, never admitting"
      - "Counsel o’ the war, but at his nurse’s tears"
      - "He whined and roar’d away your victory,"
      - "That pages blush’d at him and men of heart"
      - "Look’d wondering each at other."
    m:
      - "Yes, “Martius.” Caius Martius. Do you think I’ll honor you with that stolen name, Coriolanus, that you took in Corioles? You lords and heads of state, he has treacherously betrayed your mission and given up your city of Rome—and I mean “your city”—because of a few tears from his wife and mother. He has broken his sworn oath like a rotten braid of silk, never following the advice of his fellow officers, but at his mother’s tears he cried and gave away your victory. The young attendants blushed and the courageous men looked at each other and wondered what to think."

    o:
      - "Hear’st thou, Mars?"
    m:
      - "Do you hear this, Mars?"

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:

    m:
      - "Don’t invoke the god of war, you boy of tears!"

  - sp: CORIOLANUS
    o:
      - "Ha!"
    m:
      - "Ha!"

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:

    o:
      - "Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart"
      - "Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!"
      - "Pardon me, lords, ’tis the first time that ever"
      - "I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,"
      - "Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion—"
      - "Who wears my stripes impress’d upon him; that"
      - "Must bear my beating to his grave—shall join"
      - "To thrust the lie unto him."
    m:
      - "Incalculable liar, you make my heart swell beyond the bounds of my chest. “Boy”! Oh, slave! Forgive me, lords, this is the first time that I’ve ever been forced to scold. My grave lords, you must judge this lowlife to be the liar. Even his own version of events—he who has scars from my sword on his body and must carry the mark of my victory to his grave—will confirm that he’s the liar."

  - sp: FIRST LORD
    o:
      - "Peace, both, and hear me speak."
    m:
      - "That’s enough, both of you. Hear me speak."

    o:

      - "That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I"
      - "Flutter’d your Volscians in Corioli:"
      - "Alone I did it. Boy!"
    m:
      - "Cut me to pieces, Volsces. Men and lads, stain your swords with my blood. “Boy”! Miserable liar! If you’ve written your histories accurately, it’s recorded there that like a wolf in a hen house, I destroyed your Volscians in Corioli. I did it alone. “Boy”!"

  - sp: AUFIDIUS
    o:
      - "Why, noble lords,"
      - "Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,"
      - "Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,"
      - "’Fore your own eyes and ears?"
    m:
      - "Noble lords, remember that it was simply good luck that allowed this prideful sinner to cause you this shame, he who now stands before your own eyes and ears."

    m:
