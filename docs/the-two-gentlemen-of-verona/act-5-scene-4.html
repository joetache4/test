<b>VALENTINE</b>
<p>How use doth breed a habit in a man!</p>
<p>This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,</p>
<p>I better brook than flourishing peopled towns.</p>
<p>Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,</p>
<p>And to the nightingale’s complaining notes</p>
<p>Tune my distresses and record my woes.</p>
<p>O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,</p>
<p>Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,</p>
<p>Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall</p>
<p>And leave no memory of what it was!</p>
<p>Repair me with thy presence, Sylvia;</p>
<p>Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!</p>

<b>VALENTINE</b>
<p>Repetition can make a man accustomed to anything! This shadowy deserted place, these woods that are rarely visited—I can take them better than bustling towns with lots of people. Here I can sit alone without anyone seeing me, and accompanied by the nightingale’s sad song I can sing about my worries and list all my troubles. Oh you, Sylvia, who lives in my heart, don’t leave your home empty for long, or rotting from within, the entire building falls and leaves no trace of what it was! Heal me with your presence, Sylvia. Gentle nymph, cherish your sad lover!</p>
