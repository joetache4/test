      - "Stays but the summons of the appellant’s trumpet."
    m:

      - "As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!"
    m:
      - "In God’s name and the king’s, tell us who you are and why you have come here with armor and weapons. Who is your opponent, and what is your quarrel? Tell us the truth, as you’ve sworn on your knighthood. Make your defense."

I’m here both to defend my loyalty and the truth of my testimony to God, my king, and any children that I might have. With the grace of God and my ability to fight, I’ll prove that my opponent, the Duke of Hereford, is a traitor to God, the king, and to me. And may heaven protect me, since I fight with honor!"

      - "And formally, according to our law,"
      - "Depose him in the justice of his cause."

      - "Appointed to direct these fair designs."
    m:
      - "Only the marshal and the appointed officials may direct the proceedings, and any other person foolish enough to enter the field will be put to death."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign’s hand,"
      - "And bow my knee before his majesty:"
      - "For Mowbray and myself are like two men"
      - "That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;"
      - "Then let us take a ceremonious leave"
      - "And loving farewell of our several friends."
    m:
      - "Lord marshal, let me kiss the king’s hand and go on my knee before him. Mowbray and I are about to undertake a challenge similar to a long and difficult journey, so we should say a formal goodbye to our friends."

  - sp: LORD MARSHAL
    o:
      - "The appellant in all duty greets your highness,"
      - "And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave."
    m:
      - "The accuser greets your highness and asks to kiss your hand and say goodbye."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "We will descend and fold him in our arms."
      - "Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,"
      - "So be thy fortune in this royal fight!"
      - "Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,"
      - "Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead."
    m:
      - "I’ll step down and embrace him. Cousin of Hereford, insofar as your cause is just, I wish you luck in this fight. Goodbye, my cousin. If you die in this fight, I will grieve, but I won’t take revenge."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "O let no noble eye profane a tear"
      - "For me, if I be gored with Mowbray’s spear:"
      - "As confident as is the falcon’s flight"
      - "Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight."
      - "My loving lord, I take my leave of you;"
      - "Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;"
      - "Not sick, although I have to do with death,"
      - "But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath."
      - "Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet"
      - "The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:"
      - "O thou, the earthly author of my blood,"
      - "Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,"
      - "Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up"
      - "To reach at victory above my head,"
      - "Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;"
      - "And with thy blessings steel my lance’s point,"
      - "That it may enter Mowbray’s waxen coat,"
      - "And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,"
      - "Even in the lusty havior of his son."
    m:
      - "If I am pierced by Mowbray’s lance, don’t misuse your tears for me. I’m as confident as the hawk is when he hunts the sparrow. My loving king, goodbye, and goodbye my cousin, Lord Aumerle. I’m healthy, young, and alive now, even if I’m close to death. Lastly, I’ll say farewell to you, my father, just as at a feast I save the best morsel for the end. Oh my creator, your youthful spirit is reborn in me and energizes me to reach for victory. Give strength to my armor with your prayers, and harden my lance with your blessing, so it will pierce Mowbray’s coat of armor. May my brave deeds bring new honor to the name of John of Gaunt."

  - sp: JOHN OF GAUNT
    o:
      - "God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!"
      - "Be swift like lightning in the execution;"
      - "And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,"
      - "Fall like amazing thunder on the casque"
      - "Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:"
      - "Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live."
    m:
      - "May God give you success in your good cause! Strike as quick as lightning, and let your blows fall like thunder on the helmet of your enemy. Be courageous and fierce, and stay alive."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!"
    m:
      - "My innocence and Saint George will protect me!"

  - sp: THOMAS MOWBRAY
    o:
      - "However God or fortune cast my lot,"
      - "There lives or dies, true to King Richard’s throne,"
      - "A loyal, just and upright gentleman:"
      - "Never did captive with a freer heart"
      - "Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace"
      - "His golden uncontroll’d enfranchisement,"
      - "More than my dancing soul doth celebrate"
      - "This feast of battle with mine adversary."
      - "Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,"
      - "Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:"
      - "As gentle and as jocund as to jest"
      - "Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast."
    m:
      - "Whatever God or fate has in store for me, I will live or die as a loyal, just, and honest gentleman. I joyfully celebrate this battle against my enemy, as much as any slave celebrates who takes off his chains and becomes free. Most powerful king and my friends, I wish you all happiness in the years to come. I go to fight as happily as I would join in a celebration, because knowing that I have truth on my side makes me feel calm."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "Farewell, my lord: securely I espy"
      - "Virtue with valour couched in thine eye."
      - "Order the trial, marshal, and begin."
    m:
      - "Goodbye, my lord. I see both virtue and courage in you. Marshal, let’s begin."

  - sp: LORD MARSHAL
    o:
      - "Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,"
      - "Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!"
    m:
      - "Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby, take your lance. May God defend the right man!"

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen."
    m:
      - "With strength and hope, I say, Amen."

  - sp: LORD MARSHAL
    o:
      - "Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk."
    m:
      - "Take this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk."

  - sp: FIRST HERALD
    o:
      - "Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,"
      - "Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,"
      - "On pain to be found false and recreant,"
      - "To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,"
      - "A traitor to his God, his king and him;"
      - "And dares him to set forward to the fight."
    m:
      - "At the risk of being proved false, here stands Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby to demonstrate that the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray, is a traitor to his God, his king, and to him. He dares him to step forward and fight."

  - sp: SECOND HERALD
    o:
      - "Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,"
      - "On pain to be found false and recreant,"
      - "Both to defend himself and to approve"
      - "Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,"
      - "To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;"
      - "Courageously and with a free desire"
      - "Attending but the signal to begin."
    m:
      - "At the risk of being proved false, here stands Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, to defend himself and to prove that Henry of Hereford is disloyal to God, his king, and to him. By his own free will and with courage, he waits for the signal to begin."

  - sp: LORD MARSHAL
    o:
      - "Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants."
    m:
      - "Trumpets, play. Step forward, combatants."

  - os: "A charge sounded"
    ms: "The trumpets play to signal the charge."

  - o:
      - "Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down."
    m:
      - "Stop, the king has thrown down his baton."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,"
      - "And both return back to their chairs again:"
      - "Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound"
      - "While we return these dukes what we decree."
    m:
      - "Tell them to take off their helmets, lay down their spears, and come back to their chairs by me. Tell the trumpets to play until I deliver my decree to these men."

  - os: "A long flourish"
    ms: "The trumpets play."

  - o:
      - "Draw near,"
      - "And list what with our council we have done."
      - "For that our kingdom’s earth should not be soil’d"
      - "With that dear blood which it hath fostered;"
      - "And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect"
      - "Of civil wounds plough’d up with neighbours’ sword;"
      - "And for we think the eagle-winged pride"
      - "Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,"
      - "With rival-hating envy, set on you"
      - "To wake our peace, which in our country’s cradle"
      - "Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;"
      - "Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,"
      - "With harsh resounding trumpets’ dreadful bray,"
      - "And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,"
      - "Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace"
      - "And make us wade even in our kindred’s blood,"
      - "Therefore, we banish you our territories:"
      - "You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,"
      - "Till twice five summers have enrich’d our fields"
      - "Shall not regreet our fair dominions,"
      - "But tread the stranger paths of banishment."
    m:
      - "Draw near, and listen to what I have devised with my council. Our kingdom, where you both grew up, should not be soiled with your blood, and I hate the spectacle of settling such quarrels with swords. I think that pride, ambition, and envy have caused you to disturb the sweet peace of this country. Once that peace is broken by war drums and the clash of weapons, relatives will be killing each other. Therefore, I’m sending you out into distant territories. You, my cousin Hereford, at the threat of execution if you return, are banished for ten years."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Your will be done: this must my comfort be,"
      - "Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;"
      - "And those his golden beams to you here lent"
      - "Shall point on me and gild my banishment."
    m:
      - "I will do as you command. My comfort in my banishment will be the thought that the same sun that shines on you will shine on me wherever I am."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,"
      - "Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:"
      - "The sly slow hours shall not determinate"
      - "The dateless limit of thy dear exile;"
      - "The hopeless word of “never to return”"
      - "Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life."
    m:
      - "Norfolk, I reluctantly must give you a harsher sentence. Your absence won’t be marked by a certain number of hours. I must banish you for life."

  - sp: THOMAS MOWBRAY
    o:
      - "A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,"
      - "And all unlook’d for from your highness’ mouth:"
      - "A dearer merit, not so deep a maim"
      - "As to be cast forth in the common air,"
      - "Have I deserved at your highness’ hands."
      - "The language I have learn’d these forty years,"
      - "My native English, now I must forego:"
      - "And now my tongue’s use is to me no more"
      - "Than an unstringed viol or a harp,"
      - "Or like a cunning instrument cased up,"
      - "Or, being open, put into his hands"
      - "That knows no touch to tune the harmony:"
      - "Within my mouth you have engaol’d my tongue,"
      - "Doubly portcullis’d with my teeth and lips;"
      - "And dull unfeeling barren ignorance"
      - "Is made my gaoler to attend on me."
      - "I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,"
      - "Too far in years to be a pupil now:"
      - "What is thy sentence then but speechless death,"
      - "Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?"
    m:
      - "It’s a heavy sentence, my lord, and I didn’t expect to hear you say that. I deserved to be rewarded, not punished so harshly with exile. I’ll have to abandon my native English language, which I’ve spoken for forty years. My tongue will be of as little use as a broken violin. You’ve imprisoned it, and ignorance will be my jailer. I’m too old to learn anything new. You’ve sentenced me to die in silence."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "It boots thee not to be compassionate:"
      - "After our sentence plaining comes too late."
    m:
      - "It doesn’t help to despair, and once my sentence is handed out it is too late to lament."

  - sp: THOMAS MOWBRAY
    o:
      - "Then thus I turn me from my country’s light,"
      - "To dwell in solemn shades of endless night."
    m:
      - "Then I’ll turn away from the light of this country and resign myself to darkness."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "Return again, and take an oath with thee."
      - "Lay on our royal sword your banish’d hands;"
      - "Swear by the duty that you owe to God—"
      - "Our part therein we banish with yourselves—"
      - "To keep the oath that we administer:"
      - "You never shall, so help you truth and God!"
      - "Embrace each other’s love in banishment;"
      - "Nor never look upon each other’s face;"
      - "Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile"
      - "This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;"
      - "Nor never by advised purpose meet"
      - "To plot, contrive, or complot any ill"
      - "’Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land."
    m:
      - "Come back, and take an oath. Put your hands on my sword and swear this by your duty to God—since your duty to me will end with your banishment—that you will never greet each other in exile, or write to each other, or make up with each other, and that you won’t plot any foul deed against me, my country, my subjects, or any of my land."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "I swear."
    m:
      - "I swear."

  - sp: THOMAS MOWBRAY
    o:
      - "And I, to keep all this."
    m:
      - "So do I."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:—"
      - "By this time, had the king permitted us,"
      - "One of our souls had wander’d in the air."
      - "Banish’d this frail sepulchre of our flesh,"
      - "As now our flesh is banish’d from this land:"
      - "Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;"
      - "Since thou hast far to go, bear not along"
      - "The clogging burthen of a guilty soul."
    m:
      - "If the king had allowed us to fight, Norfolk my enemy, one of us would be dead by now. One of our souls would have been banished from its body, just as our bodies are now banished from this country. Confess your treason before you go. Don’t take the cumbersome burden of those sins with you."

  - sp: THOMAS MOWBRAY
    o:
      - "No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,"
      - "My name be blotted from the book of life,"
      - "And I from heaven banish’d as from hence!"
      - "But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;"
      - "And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue."
      - "Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;"
      - "Save back to England, all the world’s my way."
    m:
      - "No, Bolingbroke. If I were ever a traitor, may I die and be forbidden from heaven! But you and I and God all know what you are, and I fear that the king will find out all too soon—to his sorrow. Goodbye, my lord. Now I’m unable to lose my way, since my way is anywhere in the world other than England."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes"
      - "I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect"
      - "Hath from the number of his banish’d years"
      - "Pluck’d four away."
    m:
      - "Uncle, I can see in your eyes how much you are grieving. Since you are so sad, I’ll reduce your son’s exile by four years."

  - os: "To HENRY BOLINGBROKE"
    ms: "To HENRY BOLINGBROKE"

  - o:
      - "Six frozen winter spent,"
      - "Return with welcome home from banishment."
    m:
      - "After six years, you will be welcome to come home."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "How long a time lies in one little word!"
      - "Four lagging winters and four wanton springs"
      - "End in a word: such is the breath of kings."
    m:
      - "How much time is kept in a word! Four slow winters and four lush springs taken away in a word. That’s the power of a king."

  - sp: JOHN OF GAUNT
    o:
      - "I thank my liege, that in regard of me"
      - "He shortens four years of my son’s exile:"
      - "But little vantage shall I reap thereby;"
      - "For, ere the six years that he hath to spend"
      - "Can change their moons and bring their times about"
      - "My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light"
      - "Shall be extinct with age and endless night;"
      - "My inch of taper will be burnt and done,"
      - "And blindfold death not let me see my son."
    m:
      - "Thank you, my lord, for shortening my son’s exile for my sake. But I won’t gain much by it. By the time six years have passed I will be dead and won’t be able to see my son."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "Why uncle, thou hast many years to live."
    m:
      - "Why, uncle, you have many years left to live."

  - sp: JOHN OF GAUNT
    o:
      - "But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:"
      - "Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,"
      - "And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;"
      - "Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,"
      - "But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;"
      - "Thy word is current with him for my death,"
      - "But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath."
    m:
      - "But you can’t give me an extra minute of life. You can shorten my days by adding this sorrow, but you can’t add any time. You can cause me to furrow my brow, but you can’t stop a wrinkle from forming. You can order my death with a word, but once I’m dead, nothing can be done to give me another breath."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "Thy son is banish’d upon good advice,"
      - "Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:"
      - "Why at our justice seem’st thou then to lour?"
    m:
      - "Banishing your son was a good solution, and you agreed to it. Why now do you look so gloomy at my justice?"

  - sp: JOHN OF GAUNT
    o:
      - "Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour."
      - "You urged me as a judge; but I had rather"
      - "You would have bid me argue like a father."
      - "O, had it been a stranger, not my child,"
      - "To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:"
      - "A partial slander sought I to avoid,"
      - "And in the sentence my own life destroy’d."
      - "Alas, I look’d when some of you should say,"
      - "I was too strict to make mine own away;"
      - "But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue"
      - "Against my will to do myself this wrong."
    m:
      - "Sometimes a thing that tastes sweet later makes you feel sick. You asked me to be a judge, but I would rather have argued as a father. If it had been a stranger rather than my son, I would have been milder. I wanted to avoid seeming soft, and, in the process, destroyed myself. Alas, I expected someone to say I was too strict in banishing my own son, but you let me agree to this terrible decision."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:"
      - "Six years we banish him, and he shall go."
    m:
      - "Cousin, farewell. Uncle, say goodbye, too. I’ve banished him for six years, and he must go."

  - os: "Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD II and train"
    ms: "Trumpets blow. KING RICHARD II and his assistants exit."

  - sp: DUKE OF AUMERLE
    o:
      - "Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,"
      - "From where you do remain let paper show."
    m:
      - "Cousin, goodbye. Send me a letter telling me where you are, since I won’t be able to hear it from you in person."

  - sp: LORD MARSHAL
    o:
      - "My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,"
      - "As far as land will let me, by your side."
    m:
      - "My lord, I won’t say goodbye. I’ll ride with you as far as I can."

  - sp: JOHN OF GAUNT
    o:
      - "O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,"
      - "That thou return’st no greeting to thy friends?"
    m:
      - "Why are you remaining silent? Won’t you say goodbye to your friends?"

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "I have too few to take my leave of you,"
      - "When the tongue’s office should be prodigal"
      - "To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart."
    m:
      - "I should be able to tell you in several ways how sad I feel, but I have no words to express how sad I feel in saying goodbye to you."

  - sp: JOHN OF GAUNT
    o:
      - "Thy grief is but thy absence for a time."
    m:
      - "Your grief is just that you’ll be absent for a time."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Joy absent, grief is present for that time."
    m:
      - "With joy gone, grief will take up that whole time."

  - sp: JOHN OF GAUNT
    o:
      - "What is six winters? they are quickly gone."
    m:
      - "Six years will go by quickly."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten."
    m:
      - "To a happy man they would pass quickly, but with sorrow one hour feels like ten."

  - sp: JOHN OF GAUNT
    o:
      - "Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure."
    m:
      - "Think of it as a pleasure trip."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,"
      - "Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage."
    m:
      - "To pretend it is a vacation will only make it worse."

  - sp: JOHN OF GAUNT
    o:
      - "The sullen passage of thy weary steps"
      - "Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set"
      - "The precious jewel of thy home return."
    m:
      - "Think of these sorrowful years as a way to make your return home even happier."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make"
      - "Will but remember me what a deal of world"
      - "I wander from the jewels that I love."
      - "Must I not serve a long apprenticehood"
      - "To foreign passages, and in the end,"
      - "Having my freedom, boast of nothing else"
      - "But that I was a journeyman to grief?"
    m:
      - "No, every step I take away will only remind me how far I am from what I love. I’ll be serving so many long years in a foreign land, and, other than my freedom, I’ll have nothing to show for it at the end."

  - sp: JOHN OF GAUNT
    o:
      - "All places that the eye of heaven visits"
      - "Are to a wise man ports and happy havens."
      - "Teach thy necessity to reason thus;"
      - "There is no virtue like necessity."
      - "Think not the king did banish thee,"
      - "But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,"
      - "Where it perceives it is but faintly borne."
      - "Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour"
      - "And not the king exiled thee; or suppose"
      - "Devouring pestilence hangs in our air"
      - "And thou art flying to a fresher clime:"
      - "Look what thy soul holds dear, imagine it"
      - "To lie that way thou go’st, not whence thou comest:"
      - "Suppose the singing birds musicians,"
      - "The grass whereon thou tread’st the presence strew’d,"
      - "The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more"
      - "Than a delightful measure or a dance;"
      - "For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite"
      - "The man that mocks at it and sets it light."
    m:
      - "A wise man knows that anywhere heaven looks down upon is a refuge. Force yourself to think this way, because you have to. Don’t think that the king banished you but rather that you are the king. Sorrow weighs heaviest on those who bear it timidly. Pretend I sent you to go prove yourself, not that the king banished you. Or pretend that there is a plague here and that you are seeking a healthier place. Imagine that what you want the most can be found in the direction you are going, not the direction you’re coming from. Pretend the birds are musicians, and the flowers along your path are fair ladies, and your steps are a dance. Sorrow has no power to hurt the man who makes fun of it and who keeps a sense of humor."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "O, who can hold a fire in his hand"
      - "By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?"
      - "Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite"
      - "By bare imagination of a feast?"
      - "Or wallow naked in December snow"
      - "By thinking on fantastic summer’s heat?"
      - "O, no! the apprehension of the good"
      - "Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:"
      - "Fell sorrow’s tooth doth never rankle more"
      - "Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore."
    m:
      - "Who can hold a flame by pretending that it is ice? Or satisfy hunger just by thinking about a feast? Or roll in the snow naked by imagining the heat of summer? Oh, no! Imagining the best only makes the worst harder to bear. Sorrow hurts most when you treat the pain it creates without curing the cause."

  - sp: JOHN OF GAUNT
    o:
      - "Come, come, my son, I’ll bring thee on thy way:"
      - "Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay."
    m:
      - "Come, come, my son, I’ll put you on your way. If I were young enough, I wouldn’t remain here."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Then, England’s ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;"
      - "My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!"
      - "Where’er I wander, boast of this I can,"
      - "Though banish’d, yet a trueborn Englishman."
    m:
      - "Then goodbye, England’s earth. Goodbye, sweet soil, my motherland. Wherever I go, I can boast that I am a true Englishman, even if I am banished."
