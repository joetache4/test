<p>Aren’t you disturbed when the earth itself is shaking and swaying as if it were a flimsy thing? Cicero, I’ve seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees, and I’ve seen the ocean swell, rage, and foam, as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds, but never before tonight, never until now, have I experienced a storm that drops fire. Either there are wars in heaven, or else the world, too insolent toward the gods, provokes them to send destruction.</p>

<p>Besides—I ha’ not since put up my sword—</p>
<p>Against the Capitol I met a lion,</p>
<p>Who glared upon me and went surly by,</p>
<p>Without annoying me. And there were drawn</p>
<p>Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,</p>
<p>Transformèd with their fear, who swore they saw</p>
<p>Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.</p>
<p>And yesterday the bird of night did sit</p>
<p>Even at noon-day upon the marketplace,</p>
<p>Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies</p>
<p>Do so conjointly meet, let not men say,</p>
<p>“These are their reasons. They are natural.”</p>

<b>CASCA</b>
<p>A common slave—you’d know him if you saw him—held up his left hand, which flamed and burned like twenty torches together. And yet his hand was immune to the fire and didn’t get burned. Also—I’ve kept my sword unsheathed since I saw this—in front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me. And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets. And yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon. When all these extraordinary things happen at once, we shouldn’t say, “These happenings can be explained rationally. They’re natural enough.” I think these things are omens of things to come in our country.</p>

<p>You’re acting stupid, Casca, and you lack the quick wits that a Roman should have—or else you don’t use them. You go pale, you stare, and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens. But if you thought about the real reason for all these fires, all these gliding ghosts, for why birds and animals abandon their natural behavior, why old men, fools, and children make predictions, why all sorts of things have departed from the usual course of their natures and become monstrosities, then you’d understand that heaven had them act this way so they would serve as frightening warnings of an unnatural state to come. Right this minute, Casca, I could name a man who’s just like this dreadful night. A man who thunders, throws lightning, splits open graves, and roars like the lion in the Capitol. A man no mightier than you or I in ability, yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight’s strange happenings.</p>

Rome becomes complete trash, nothing but rubbish and garbage, when it works to light up the ambitions of someone as worthless as Caesar. But, oh no! What have I said in my grief?
