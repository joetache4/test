<p>I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that</p>

<p>favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like</p>

<p>with the buttock of the night than with the forehead</p>
<p>of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my</p>
<p>malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as</p>
<p>you are—I cannot call you Lycurguses—if the drink</p>
<p>you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a</p>
<p>crooked face at it. I can’t say your worships have</p>
<p>delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in</p>
<p>compound with the major part of your syllables: and</p>
<p>though I must be content to bear with those that say</p>
<p>you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that</p>
<p>tell you you have good faces. If you see this in</p>
<p>the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known</p>

<b>MENENIUS</b>
<p>I’m known as a moody aristocrat, and one that loves a cup of hot wine not diluted by even a drop of water from the Tiber River. I’m said to be somewhat flawed as a judge because I’m hastily swayed by the first argument I hear. I’m quick to anger at the slightest disturbance. I stay up late at night and don’t rise early in the morning. I say whatever I think and express my anger when I speak. Meeting two statesmen such as yourselves—I cannot call you lawmakers—if I don’t like the drink you give me, I make a crooked face at it. I don’t think you deserve the respectful titles of your profession, when I find most of what you say to be asinine. And though I can tolerate those that say you are respectable, serious men, the ones who say you are honest are deadly liars. If you see these same qualities in me, doesn’t it make sense that I’m known for my bad qualities? What harm can your misperceptions do to my character, if I already have a bad reputation?</p>

<p>second day of audience. When you are hearing a</p>
<p>matter between party and party, if you chance to be</p>

<p>mummers; set up the bloody flag against all</p>

<p>dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled</p>

<p>You don’t know anything about me, or about yourselves. Your ambition is to have poor citizens take off their hats and bow down to you. You’ll waste a whole morning listening to a dispute over three pence between an orange vendor and a wine tap seller and then postpone settling the issue until the next day. When you’re hearing a matter between two parties, if you’re feeling the tiniest bit sick, you become very dramatic: you violently refuse to be patient and, demanding a chamber pot, dismiss the controversy, leaving it even more entangled as a result of your hearing it.  The only justice you show is in calling both parties scoundrels. You’re a pair of strange men.</p>

You say Martius is proud, but even guessing conservatively, he’s worth all your predecessors since Deucalion, who survived the flood, even though some of them may have been hangmen. Good evening to you both. To keep talking with you would infect my brain, since you are the herdsmen of the beastly common people. I must go.</p>

Storefronts are boarded up, leaden roofs covered over and all different types of people are riding their horses on top of the roofs, all trying to see him. Priests who rarely come out in public are mixed in with the common people and struggle to find a place in the crowd. Women who usually wear veils are letting their pale cheeks get sunburned.
