<p>Struggling with the wind and rain. He’s shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea, or make the sea flood the earth—he wants to see the world return to primal chaos. He keeps tearing out his white hair, which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness. Small but brave in his surroundings, he’s trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth. He’s running bareheaded, calling for the end of the world, out there on a night like this, when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide.</p>

<p>Sir, I do know you,</p>
<p>And dare upon the warrant of my note</p>
<p>Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,</p>
<p>Although as yet the face of it be covered</p>
<p>With mutual cunning, ’twixt Albany and Cornwall,</p>
<p>Who have—as who have not that their great stars</p>
<p>Throned and set high?—servants, who seem no less,</p>
<p>Which are to France the spies and speculations</p>
<p>Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,</p>
<p>Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,</p>
<p>Or the hard rein which both of them hath borne</p>
<p>Against the old kind king, or something deeper,</p>
<p>Whereof perchance these are but furnishings—</p>
<p>But true it is. From France there comes a power</p>
<p>Into this scattered kingdom, who already,</p>
<p>Wise in our negligence, have secret feet</p>
<p>In some of our best ports and are at point</p>
<p>To show their open banner. Now to you.</p>
<p>If on my credit you dare build so far</p>
<p>To make your speed to Dover, you shall find</p>
<p>Some that will thank you, making just report</p>
<p>Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow</p>
<p>The king hath cause to plain.</p>
<p>I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,</p>
<p>And from some knowledge and assurance offer</p>
<p>This office to you.</p>

<b>KENT</b>
<p>Sir, I know you, and I trust you enough to share something very important with you. There’s a feud between Albany and Cornwall, although they’ve been clever enough to hide it thus far. Like other powerful rulers, they have servants who are actually French spies in disguise. These spies have noticed something, perhaps in the squabbles between Albany and Cornwall, or in the tough line both of them have taken against the good old king, or perhaps in some deeper matter at the root of both of these problems—The point is that the King of France has sent troops into our divided kingdom. Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war. Now this is where you come in. If you trust me enough to hurry to Dover, you’ll earn the gratitude of many people when you fairly report the monstrous and maddening extent of the king’s suffering. I’m a nobleman, and I know what I’m doing in assigning this job to you.</p>

<p><em>(giving the GENTLEMAN a purse and a ring)</em> No, there’s no need. To assure you that I am a nobleman in disguise, here is some money. If you see Cordelia—as I’m sure you will—show her this ring. She’ll tell you who I am. Damn this storm! I’ll go find the king.</p>
