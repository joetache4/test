  - os: "Enter ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS"
    ms: "ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS enter."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "These many, then, shall die. Their names are pricked."
    m:
      - "These ones, then, will be assassinated. Their names are marked."

  - sp: OCTAVIUS
    o:
      - "*(to LEPIDUS)*"
      - "Your brother too must die. Consent you, Lepidus?"
    m:
      - "*(to LEPIDUS)* Your brother has to die too. Do you agree, Lepidus?"

  - sp: LEPIDUS
    o:
      - "I do consent—"
    m:
      - "I agree—"

  - sp: OCTAVIUS
    o:
      - "  Prick him down, Antony."
    m:
      - "Put a mark next to his name too, Antony."

  - sp: LEPIDUS
    o:
      - "Upon condition Publius shall not live,"
      - "Who is your sister’s son, Mark Antony."
    m:
      - "On the condition that your sister’s son, Publius, also must die, Mark Antony."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "He shall not live. Look, with a spot I damn him."
      - "But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar’s house."
      - "Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine"
      - "How to cut off some charge in legacies."
    m:
      - "He will die. See—I’ve sealed his fate with this mark next to his name. But, Lepidus, go to Caesar’s house. Bring his will here, and we’ll figure out a way to reduce his bequests to the people."

  - sp: LEPIDUS
    o:
      - "What, shall I find you here?"
    m:
      - "Will you be here when I return?"

  - sp: OCTAVIUS
    o:
      - "Or here, or at the Capitol."
    m:
      - "Either here or at the Capitol."

  - os: "Exit LEPIDUS"
    ms: "LEPIDUS exits."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "This is a slight, unmeritable man,"
      - "Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,"
      - "The threefold world divided, he should stand"
      - "One of the three to share it?"
    m:
      - "He’s an unremarkable man, fit only to be sent on errands. Does it really make sense, once we divide the world into three parts, that he should be one of the three rulers?"

  - sp: OCTAVIUS
    o:
      - "    So you thought him."
      - "And took his voice who should be pricked to die"
      - "In our black sentence and proscription."
    m:
      - "You thought it made sense, and you listened to him about who should be marked to die in these harsh death sentences."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "Octavius, I have seen more days than you."
      - "And though we lay these honors on this man"
      - "To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,"
      - "He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,"
      - "To groan and sweat under the business,"
      - "Either led or driven, as we point the way."
      - "And having brought our treasure where we will,"
      - "Then take we down his load and turn him off,"
      - "Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears"
      - "And graze in commons."
    m:
      - "Octavius, I’m older than you are. And although we’re giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we’re doing, he’ll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold—groaning and sweating under the load, either led or pushed, as we direct him. Once he’s carried our treasure where we want it, we’ll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass, to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures."

  - sp: OCTAVIUS
    o:
      - "    You may do your will,"
      - "But he’s a tried and valiant soldier."
    m:
      - "You can do what you want, but he’s an experienced and honorable soldier."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "So is my horse, Octavius, and for that"
      - "I do appoint him store of provender."
      - "It is a creature that I teach to fight,"
      - "To wind, to stop, to run directly on,"
      - "His corporal motion governed by my spirit,"
      - "And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so."
      - "He must be taught and trained and bid go forth,"
      - "A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds"
      - "On objects, arts, and imitations,"
      - "Which, out of use and staled by other men,"
      - "Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him"
      - "But as a property. And now, Octavius,"
      - "Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius"
      - "Are levying powers. We must straight make head."
      - "Therefore let our alliance be combined,"
      - "Our best friends made, our means stretched."
      - "And let us presently go sit in council"
      - "How covert matters may be best disclosed,"
      - "And open perils surest answered."
    m:
      - "So is my horse, Octavius, and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants. But my horse is a creature that *I* teach to fight—to turn, to stop, to run in a straight line. I govern the motion of his body. And in some ways, Lepidus is just like that. He has to be taught and trained and told to go forward. He’s an empty man, who pays attention to fashions and tastes that other men took up and got tired of long ago. Don’t think about Lepidus except as a means to an end. And now, Octavius, listen to more important things. Brutus and Cassius are raising armies. We have to raise our own immediately. So, we should combine forces and organize our allies, pull together our friends, and stretch our resources as far as they’ll go. Let’s immediately organize a council to discuss the best way to find out their secrets and the safest way to confront the threats we’re already faced with."

  - sp: OCTAVIUS
    o:
      - "Let us do so. For we are at the stake"
      - "And bayed about with many enemies."
      - "And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,"
      - "Millions of mischiefs."
    m:
      - "Let’s do that, because we’re hemmed in by many enemies. And even some of the people who smile at us are in fact plotting against us, I’m afraid."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
