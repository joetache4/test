<p>I’ll undertake ’t:</p>

<p>He was not taken well; he had not dined:</p>
<p>The veins unfill’d, our blood is cold, and then</p>
<p>We pout upon the morning, are unapt</p>
<p>To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff’d</p>
<p>These and these conveyances of our blood</p>
<p>With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls</p>
<p>Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I’ll watch him</p>
<p>Till he be dieted to my request,</p>
<p>And then I’ll set upon him.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>MENENIUS</b>
<p>I’ll try. I think he’ll listen to me. But it discourages me that he bit his lip and hummed at good Cominius. Martius wasn’t approached skillfully—he hadn’t eaten. When the veins are empty, our blood is cold, and then our outlook on the day is sour. We are unlikely to give or to forgive. But when we have stuffed ourselves with food and wine, we become more flexible than when we’re stiff with hunger. So before I ask him, I’ll be sure that he has eaten and is therefore likely to grant my request.</p>

<p>I tell you, he’s sitting on a golden throne, and his eyes are red enough to burn Rome, and his feeling of having been wronged overwhelms his pity. I knelt before him, and he very quietly said, “Rise,” and without a word, he waved for me to leave. He sent me a letter saying what he will do, and he has sworn not to yield on his conditions. There is no hope unless, as I hear, his noble mother and his wife are able to convince him to have mercy on his country. So let’s go then and urge them to hurry.</p>
