<b>ANTONY</b>
<p><em>(to THIDIAS)</em> If your father is alive, let him be sorry you weren’t born a daughter. And you should be sorry to follow Caesar in his triumphal parade, since you have been whipped for following him. From now on, you should tremble and grow feverish whenever you see the white hand of a lady. Get yourself back to Caesar. Tell him how you’ve been treated. Be sure you tell him he makes me angry with him, because he seems proud and disdainful, harping on what I am now rather than what he knows. He makes me angry—and that’s easy to do right now, now that my lucky stars have abandoned me. If he doesn’t like what I’ve said or done, remind him that he holds Hipparchus, a slave I freed. He may whip, or hang, or torture him as he pleases. Then we will be even. Recommend that to him. Take your whipping scars and go.</p>
