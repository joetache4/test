<b>PORTIA</b>
<p><em>(to BASSANIO)</em> I pray you, tarry. Pause a day or two</p>
<p>Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong</p>
<p>I lose your company. Therefore forbear awhile.</p>
<p>There’s something tells me—but it is not love—</p>
<p>I would not lose you, and you know yourself</p>
<p>Hate counsels not in such a quality.</p>
<p>But lest you should not understand me well—</p>
<p>And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought—</p>
<p>I would detain you here some month or two</p>
<p>Before you venture for me. I could teach you</p>
<p>How to choose right, but I am then forsworn.</p>
<p>So will I never be. So may you miss me.</p>
<p>But if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin,</p>
<p>That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,</p>
<p>They have o’erlooked me and divided me.</p>
<p>One half of me is yours, the other half yours—</p>
<p>Mine own, I would say. But if mine, then yours,</p>
<p>And so all yours. Oh, these naughty times</p>
<p>Put bars between the owners and their rights!</p>
<p>And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so.</p>
<p>Let Fortune go to hell for it, not I.</p>
<p>I speak too long, but ’tis to peize the time,</p>
<p>To eke it and to draw it out in length,</p>
<p>To stay you from election.</p>

<b>PORTIA</b>
<p><em>(to BASSANIO)</em> Please wait a day or two before making your choice. If you choose wrong, I’ll lose your company. So wait a while. Something tells me—not love, but something—that I don’t want to lose you, and you know that if I hated you I wouldn’t think that. But let me put it more clearly in case you don’t understand—though I know girls aren’t supposed to express their thoughts—I’m just saying I’d like you to stay here for a month or two before you undergo the test for me. I could tell you how to choose correctly, but then I’d be disregarding the oath I took. So I’ll never tell. But you might lose me by making the wrong choice. If you do choose wrong, you’ll make me wish for something very bad. I’d wish I had ignored my oath and told you everything. God, your eyes have bewitched me. They’ve divided me in two. One half of me is yours, and the other half—my own half, I’d call it—belongs to you too. If it’s mine, then it’s yours, and so I’m all yours. But in this awful day and age people don’t even have the right to their own property! So though I’m yours, I’m not yours. If there’s no chance for me to be yours, then it’s just bad luck. I know I’m talking too much, but I do that just to make the time last longer, and to postpone your test.</p>

<p>Away, then. I am locked in one of them.</p>

<p>Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end,</p>
<p>Fading in music. That the comparison</p>
<p>May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream</p>
<p>And watery deathbed for him. He may win,</p>
<p>And what is music then? Then music is</p>
<p>Even as the flourish when true subjects bow</p>
<p>To a new-crownèd monarch. Such it is</p>
<p>As are those dulcet sounds in break of day</p>
<p>That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear</p>
<p>And summon him to marriage.</p>
<p>Now he goes</p>
<p>With no less presence but with much more love</p>
<p>Than young Alcides, when he did redeem</p>
<p>The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy</p>
<p>To the sea monster. I stand for sacrifice.</p>
<p>The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,</p>
<p>With blearèd visages come forth to view</p>

<p>Go ahead, then. I’m locked in one of them. If you really love me, you’ll find me.—Nerissa and the rest of you, get away from him. Play some music while he chooses. Then if he loses, it’ll be his swan song, music before the end. And since swans need water to swim in, I’ll cry him a river when he loses. But on the other hand, he may win. What music should we play then? If he wins, the music should be like the majestic trumpets that blare when subjects bow to a newly crowned monarch. It’s the sweet sounds at daybreak that the dreaming bridegroom hears on his wedding morning, calling him to the church. Bassanio’s walking to the boxes now. He looks as dignified as Hercules did when he saved the princess Hesione from the sea monster. But he loves me more than Hercules loved the princess. I’ll play Hesione, and everyone else will be the bystanders watching with tear-streaked faces. We’ve all come out to see what will happen.—Go, Hercules! If you survive, I’ll live. I’m more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself.</p>

<p>So may the outward shows be least themselves.</p>
<p>The world is still deceived with ornament.</p>
<p>In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt</p>
<p>But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,</p>
<p>Obscures the show of evil? In religion,</p>
<p>What damnèd error, but some sober brow</p>
<p>Will bless it and approve it with a text,</p>
<p>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?</p>
<p>There is no vice so simple but assumes</p>
<p>Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.</p>
<p>How many cowards whose hearts are all as false</p>
<p>As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins</p>
<p>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,</p>
<p>Who, inward searched, have livers white as milk,</p>
<p>And these assume but valor’s excrement</p>
<p>To render them redoubted. Look on beauty,</p>
<p>And you shall see ’tis purchased by the weight,</p>
<p>Which therein works a miracle in nature,</p>
<p>Making them lightest that wear most of it.</p>
<p>So are those crispèd snaky golden locks</p>
<p>Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind,</p>
<p>Upon supposèd fairness, often known</p>
<p>To be the dowry of a second head,</p>
<p>The skull that bred them in the sepulcher.</p>
<p>Thus ornament is but the guilèd shore</p>
<p>To a most dangerous sea, the beauteous scarf</p>
<p>Veiling an Indian beauty—in a word,</p>
<p>The seeming truth which cunning times put on</p>
<p>To entrap the wisest. Therefore then, thou gaudy gold,</p>
<p>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee.</p>
<p>Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge</p>
<p>’Tween man and man. But thou, thou meagre lead,</p>
<p>Which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught,</p>
<p>Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence,</p>
<p>And here choose I. Joy be the consequence!</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>BASSANIO</b>
<p>You can’t always judge a book by its cover. People are often tricked by false appearances. In court, someone can deliver a false plea but hide its wickedness with a pretty voice. In religion, don’t serious men defend sins with Scripture, covering up evil with a show of good. Every sin in the world manages to make itself look good somehow. How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars, the god of war? Take another example: beauty. It can be bought by the ounce in makeup, which works miracles. Women who wear it the most are respected the least. It’s the same thing with hair. Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful. But you can buy that kind of hair as a wig, and wigs are made from dead people’s hair. Decoration’s nothing but a danger, meant to trick and trap the viewer. A lovely, cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea, just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty. Nowadays, everyone’s fooled by appearances. So I’ll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box—it’s like the gold that Midas couldn’t eat. And I’ll have nothing to do with the pale silver either, the metal that common coins are made of. But this humble lead one, though it looks too threatening to promise me anything good, moves me more than I can say. So this is the one I choose. I hope I’m happy with my choice!</p>

<p>Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,</p>
<p>Seem they in motion? Here are severed lips,</p>
<p>Parted with sugar breath. So sweet a bar</p>
<p>Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs,</p>
<p>The painter plays the spider and hath woven</p>
<p>A golden mesh t’ entrap the hearts of men</p>
<p>Faster than gnats in cobwebs. But her eyes—</p>
<p>How could he see to do them? Having made one,</p>
<p>Methinks it should have power to steal both his</p>
<p>And leave itself unfurnished. Yet look how far</p>
<p>The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow</p>
<p>In underprizing it, so far this shadow</p>
<p>Doth limp behind the substance. Here’s the scroll,</p>
<p>The continent and summary of my fortune.</p>

<p>“You that choose not by the view,</p>

<b>BASSANIO</b>
<p><em>(opening the lead box)</em> What do we have here? A picture of beautiful Portia! What artist captured her likeness so well? Are these eyes moving? Or do they just seem to move as my eyes move? Her sweet breath forces her lips open, a lovely divider of lovely lips. And look at her hair, looking like a golden mesh to trap the hearts of men, like little flies in a cobweb. The painter was like a spider in creating it so delicately. But her eyes—how could he keep looking at them long enough to paint them? I would’ve expected that when he finished one of them, it would have enraptured him and kept him from painting the other. But I’m giving only faint praise of the picture, just as the picture, as good as it is, is only a faint imitation of the real woman herself. Here’s the scroll that sums up my fate:</p>
<p><em>(he reads)</em></p>
<p>“You who don’t judge by looks alone,</p>
<p>Have better luck, and make the right choice.</p>
<p>Since this prize is yours,</p>
<p>Be happy with it, and don’t look for a new one.</p>
<p>If you’re happy with what you’ve won</p>
<p>And accept this prize as your blissful destiny,</p>
<p>Then turn to where your lady is,</p>
<p>And claim her with a loving kiss.”</p>

What you’re getting is an innocent and inexperienced girl. I’m happy that at least I’m not too old to learn new things. I’m even happier that I’m not stupid, and I can learn. I’m happiest of all that I’m yours now, my lord, my king, and you can guide me as you wish. Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you. Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion, master of these servants, and queen over myself. But as of right this second all these things are yours.

<p>O sweet Portia,</p>
<p>Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words</p>
<p>That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,</p>
<p>When I did first impart my love to you,</p>
<p>I freely told you, all the wealth I had</p>
<p>Ran in my veins. I was a gentleman,</p>
<p>And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,</p>
<p>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</p>
<p>How much I was a braggart. When I told you</p>
<p>My state was nothing, I should then have told you</p>
<p>That I was worse than nothing, for indeed</p>
<p>I have engaged myself to a dear friend,</p>
<p>Engaged my friend to his mere enemy</p>
<p>To feed my means.</p>
<p>Here is a letter, lady,</p>
<p>The paper as the body of my friend,</p>
<p>And every word in it a gaping wound,</p>
<p>Issuing life blood.—But is it true, Salerio?</p>
<p>Have all his ventures failed? What, not one hit?</p>
<p>From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,</p>
<p>From Lisbon, Barbary, and India?</p>
<p>And not one vessel ’scape the dreadful touch</p>
<p>Of merchant-marring rocks?</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>BASSANIO</b>
<p>Oh Portia, these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper. My darling, when I gave my love to you, I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins—that I have noble blood, but no money. When I said that, I told you the truth. But my dear, when I said I was worth nothing, I was actually bragging—I should’ve said that I was worse than nothing. I’ve borrowed money from a dear friend who in turn borrowed money from his mortal enemy for my sake. Here’s a letter, my dear. The paper’s like my friend’s body, and every word in it is a bleeding wound on that body.—But is it true, Salerio? Have all his business ventures failed? Not even one success? He had ships to Tripolis, Mexico, England, Lisbon, North Africa, and India, and not one of these ships avoided the rocks?</p>

<p>Not one, my lord.</p>
<p>Besides, it should appear that if he had</p>
<p>The present money to discharge the Jew,</p>
<p>He would not take it. Never did I know</p>
<p>A creature that did bear the shape of man</p>
<p>So keen and greedy to confound a man.</p>
<p>He plies the duke at morning and at night,</p>
<p>And doth impeach the freedom of the state</p>
<p>If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,</p>
<p>The duke himself, and the magnificoes</p>
<p>Of greatest port have all persuaded with him.</p>
<p>But none can drive him from the envious plea</p>
<p>Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.</p>

<b>SALERIO</b>
<p>Not one, my lord. Anyway, even if he had the money now, the Jew probably wouldn’t take it. I’ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man. He’s at the duke’s morning and night, accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice. Twenty merchants, the duke himself, and the highest-ranking Venetian nobles have all tried to persuade him to forget his contract, but nobody can do it. He’s determined to get the penalty specified in his contract with Antonio.</p>
