    ms: "PISTOL, HOSTESS, NYM, BARDOLPH, and BOY enter."

  - sp: HOSTESS
    o:
      - "Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines."
    m:
      - "Please, sweet husband, let me come with you as far as the town of Staines."

  - sp: PISTOL
    o:
      - "No; for my manly heart doth earn.—Bardolph, be blithe.— Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins.—Boy, bristle thy courage up. For Falstaff, he is dead, and we must earn therefore."
    m:
      - "No, because my manly heart is grieving. Bardolph, be happy.—Nym, rouse your bragging spirits.—Boy, be brave. Falstaff is dead, and we must mourn him."

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "Would I were with him, wheresome’er he is, either in heaven or in hell."
    m:
      - "I wish I were with him, wherever he is—in heaven or in hell."

  - sp: HOSTESS
    o:
      - "Nay, sure, he’s not in hell! He’s in Arthur’s bosom, if ever man went to Arthur’s bosom. He made a finer end, and went away an it had been any christom child. He parted ev’n just between twelve and one, ev’n at the turning o’ th’ tide; for after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his finger’s end, I knew there was but one way, for his nose was as sharp as a pen, and he told of green fields. “How now, Sir John?” quoth I. “What, man, be o’ good cheer!” So he cried out “God, God, God!” three or four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him he should not think of God. I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So he bade me lay more clothes on his feet. I put my hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone. Then I felt to his knees, and so upward and upward, and all was as cold as any stone."
    m:
      - "Oh, no, he’s surely not in hell. He’s in Arthur’s bosom, if any man ever went to Arthur’s bosom. He died as peacefully as a baby. He departed right between twelve and one, just as the tide was turning. For after I saw him fumbling with the sheets and playing with imaginary flowers and smiling at the ends of his fingers, I knew it was the end. His face was gaunt and he was babbling about green fields. “Now, now, Sir John!” I said. “What’s all this? Cheer up!” And he called out “God, God, God!” three or four times. To soothe him, I told him not to think of God, that I hoped it wasn’t yet time to bother with such thoughts. So he asked me to put more blankets on his feet. I put my hand into the bed and felt his feet, and they were stone-cold. Then I felt his legs, and they were stone-cold, and so I moved upward and upward, and his whole body was stone-cold."

  - sp: NYM
    o:
      - "They say he cried out of sack."
    m:
      - "They say he cried out against sherry."

  - sp: HOSTESS
    o:
      - "Ay, that he did."
    m:
      - "Yes, he did."

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "And of women."
    m:
      - "And women."

  - sp: HOSTESS
    o:
      - "Nay, that he did not."
    m:
      - "No, he did not."

  - sp: BOY
    o:
      - "Yes, that he did, and said they were devils incarnate."
    m:
      - "Yes, he did. He said they were devils incarnate."

  - sp: HOSTESS
    o:
      - "’A could never abide carnation. ’Twas a color he never liked."
    m:
      - "He could never bear carnation. It was a color he never did like."

  - sp: BOY
    o:
      - "He said once the devil would have him about women."
    m:
      - "He once said the devil would get him because of women."

  - sp: HOSTESS
    o:
      - "He did in some sort, indeed, handle women, but then he was rheumatic, and talked of the Whore of Babylon."
    m:
      - "He did touch on women a bit, but his body was aching with fever and he talked about the Whore of Babylon."

  - sp: BOY
    o:
      - "Do you not remember he saw a flea stick upon Bardolph’s nose, and he said it was a black soul burning in hell?"
    m:
      - "Don’t you remember how he saw a flea land on Bardolph’s nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell?"

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire. That’s all the riches I got in his service."
    m:
      - "Well, the fuel that sustained that fire is gone. That’s all the wealth I ever earned in his company."

  - sp: NYM
    o:
      - "Shall we shog? The King will be gone from Southampton."
    m:
      - "Shall we get moving? The king will already have left Southampton."

  - sp: PISTOL
    o:
      - "Come, let’s away.—My love, give me thy lips."
      - "Look to my chattels and my movables."
      - "Let senses rule. The word is “Pitch and pay.”"
      - "Trust none, for oaths are straws, men’s faiths are"
      - "  wafer-cakes,"
      - "And Holdfast is the only dog, my duck."
      - "Therefore, *caveto* be thy counselor."
      - "Go, clear thy crystals.—Yoke-fellows in arms,"
      - "Let us to France, like horse-leeches, my boys,"
      - "To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck."
    m:
      - "Come, let’s be on our way. My love, let me kiss your lips. Look after my goods and possessions. Keep on your toes: the rule is “cash down, no credit.” Trust no one. For oaths are as easily broken as straws, and men’s faith crumbles like crackers, and you can only rely on what you can hold onto. Let caution be your guide. Go dry your eyes. Brothers in arms, we’re off to France—like leeches, my boys: to suck, to suck, their very blood to suck!"

  - sp: BOY
    o:
      - "And that’s but unwholesome food, they say."
    m:
      - "I’ve heard that’s not the most nourishing food."

  - sp: PISTOL
    o:
      - "Touch her soft mouth, and march."
    m:

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "Farewell, hostess. *(kissing her)*"
    m:
      - "Farewell, hostess. *(kisses her)*"

  - sp: NYM
    o:
      - "I cannot kiss, that is the humor of it. But adieu."
    m:
      - "I can’t kiss—that’s just how it is—but farewell."

  - sp: PISTOL
    o:
      - "Let housewifery appear. Keep close, I thee command."
    m:
      - "Be thrifty. And keep yourself hidden, I command you."

  - sp: HOSTESS
    o:
      - "Farewell. Adieu."
