<p>Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain of this</p>
<p>foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent</p>
<p>anything that tends to laughter more than I invent, or is</p>
<p>invented on me. I am not only witty in myself, but the cause</p>
<p>that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath</p>
<p>overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the Prince put</p>
<p>thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off,</p>
<p>why then I have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake,</p>
<p>thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels.</p>
<p>I was never manned with an agate till now, but I will inset</p>
<p>you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send</p>
<p>you back again to your master for a jewel. The juvenal, the</p>
<p>Prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledge—I will</p>
<p>sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he</p>
<p>shall get one off his cheek, and yet he will not stick to say</p>
<p>his face is a face royal. God may finish it when He will. ’Tis</p>
<p>not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still at a face royal, for</p>
<p>a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it, and yet he’ll be</p>
<p>crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was</p>
<p>a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but he’s almost out of</p>
<p>mine, I can assure him. What said Master Dommelton about</p>
<p>the satin for my short cloak and my slops?</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>FALSTAFF</b>
<p>All kinds of people make it a matter of pride to heckle me. No man—that foolishly assembled lump of clay—could ever invent something quite as funny as I seem to be to other people. I’m not only witty on my own, but I bring out wit in other people. Look at the two of us, walking here: I look like a sow that’s smothered all of her baby pigs, except for you. If the Prince sent you to serve me for any other reason than to irritate me, I’m a fool. You weedy little son of a bitch: you’re so tiny that you should be a decoration on my hat, not a servant at my feet. I’ve never had a servant before who was as tiny as a ring stone. But I won’t set you in a gold or silver ring; I’ll wrap you in rags and send you back to your master, to be used as a jewel—that youth, the Prince your master, whose chin is still lacking a beard. Why, I’ll grow a beard in the palm of my hand before he’ll have one that he can shave off his face. And yet, this doesn’t stop him from claiming that he has a face for royalty. Well, God will give him a beard whenever he chooses to—there’s not a hair out of place yet. It’s a good thing the Prince’s face is a royal, because a barber will never earn a coin from shaving it. And still, the Prince brags that he’s been a full-grown man since before he was born. He can keep that title, for all I care; I have no affection for him now, I can assure him. What did Master Dommelton say about the satin for my cape and baggy trousers?</p>

<b>FALSTAFF</b>
<p>Damn him to hell then, just like Dives in the Bible—the rich glutton who rejected the beggar Lazarus! And may Dommelton burn even hotter! He’s a son-of-a-bitch traitor! A two-faced liar, who smiles and says “Yes sir, that’ll be fine” to my face, and then demands a guarantee of payment! These bastard shopkeepers, with their fashionable short haircuts, and fancy shoes, and their fat key chains on their belts—you make an agreement to put something on credit, and then they throw a “guarantee of payment” at you. I would rather eat rat poison than guarantee my payment. I expected him to send me twenty-two yards of satin, and instead he sends me a “guarantee of payment.” Well, let him guarantee himself a good night’s sleep. After all, his wife’s in somebody else’s bed, so why not? She’s practically shining a spotlight on her adultery, but he’s so clueless he can’t even tell. Where’s Bardolph?</p>

<p>Not so, my lord. Your ill angel is light, but I hope he that</p>
<p>looks upon me will take me without weighing. And yet in</p>
<p>some respects I grant I cannot go. I cannot tell. Virtue is of</p>
<p>so little regard in these costermongers’ times that true valor</p>
<p>is turned bear-herd; pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath his</p>
<p>quick wit wasted in giving reckonings. All the other gifts</p>
<p>appurtenant to man, as the malice of this age shapes them,</p>
<p>are not worth a gooseberry. You that are old consider not the</p>
<p>capacities of us that are young. You do measure the heat of</p>
<p>our livers with the bitterness of your galls, and we that are in</p>
<p>the vaward of our youth, I must confess, are wags too.</p>

<b>FALSTAFF</b>
<p>That’s not so, my lord. False angels are light, and anyone can see without having to weigh me that I’m too heavy. But I don’t know; in some ways, you’re right. I’m not for these times. Virtue counts for so little in this commercial world of ours. True courage is worthless; it’s only used by animal trainers in the bear-baiting rings. Intelligence is good for nobody but bartenders, who waste their wits totaling up tavern bills. In these mean-spirited days, man’s best qualities aren’t worth a thing. You older folks don’t value us young people. You measure our fiery passion according to your melancholic bitterness. And I have to tell you, those of us who are highly advanced in our youth, we’re spirited as well as young.</p>

<p>Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are</p>
<p>written down old with all the characters of age? Have you</p>
<p>not a moist eye, a dry hand, a yellow cheek, a white beard,</p>
<p>a decreasing leg, an increasing belly? Is not your voice</p>
<p>broken, your wind short, your chin double, your wit single,</p>
<p>and every part about you blasted with antiquity? And will</p>
<p>you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John.</p>
</td>

<b>CHIEF JUSTICE</b>
<p>You’d add your name to the list of the young? You, who have age written all over you? Don’t you have mucus in your eyes? Dry skin? Jaundice? A white beard? An arthritic leg? A growing belly? Isn’t your voice scratchy? Your breath short? Your chin doubled? Your last wit abandoned? Isn’t every part of you devastated by age? And still you call yourself young? Shame on you, Sir John.</p>

<p>My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon,</p>
<p>with a white head and something a round belly. For my</p>
<p>voice, I have lost it with halloing and singing of anthems. To</p>
<p>approve my youth further, I will not. The truth is, I am only</p>
<p>old in judgment and understanding. And he that will caper</p>
<p>with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money,</p>
<p>and have at him! For the box of the ear that the Prince gave</p>
<p>you, he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a</p>
<p>sensible lord. I have checked him for it, and the young lion</p>
<p>repents. Marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk and old sack.</p>

<b>FALSTAFF</b>
<p>Sir, I was born around three o’clock in the afternoon, with a white head and a bit of a round belly. As for my scratchy voice, I lost it through shouting and singing loud songs. But I won’t try to prove how young I am any longer. I have only one trait of old age, and that is wisdom. If somebody wants to challenge me to a dance contest for a thousand-mark wager, let him hand me the money and off we go. Now, as for the fact that the Prince hit you on the head, he did it like a rude prince and you took it like a sensible gentleman. I reprimanded him for it, and he repents. He’s not wearing the traditional sackcloth and ashes, for sure, but he’s repenting in silk cloth and wine.</p>

<p>Yea, I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look you pray,</p>
<p>all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home, that our armies join</p>
<p>not in a hot day, for, by the Lord, I take but two shirts out with</p>
<p>me, and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily. If it be a hot day</p>
<p>and I brandish anything but a bottle, I would I might never</p>
<p>spit white again. There is not a dangerous action can peep</p>
<p>out his head but I am thrust upon it. Well, I cannot last ever.</p>
<p>But it was always yet the trick of our English nation, if they</p>
<p>have a good thing, to make it too common. If ye will needs</p>
<p>say I am an old man, you should give me rest. I would to God</p>
<p>my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is. I were</p>
<p>better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to</p>
<p>nothing with perpetual motion.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>FALSTAFF</b>
<p>Yes, and thanks for reminding me. I hope that all of you who stay home, safe and sound, will say a prayer that we soldiers don’t end up in some hot battle. For, by the Lord, I’ve only packed two shirts, and I don’t want to sweat too much. If things get hot and I pull out any other weapon besides a bottle, I’ll never drink wine again. I get sent out on every dangerous assignment that comes up. Well, I can’t live forever. That’s the thing about the English: when they have something good, they use it continually. If you’re going to insist that I’m an old man, then let me rest. I wish to God the enemy weren’t as scared of me as they are: I’d rather sit and rust than be worn out by all this work.</p>
