<p>In this fine age were not thought flattery,</p>

<p>Well said, you excellent Scotsman. If people these days didn’t confuse the truth with flattery, I would praise you highly.

<p>Sick now? Faint now? His disease is infecting our entire project. It’s spread all the way to here, right to our camp. He writes that some internal illness—and that his allies couldn’t be gathered so quickly by one of his deputies. Besides, he didn’t think it was appropriate to delegate such a dangerous and important task to someone other than himself. But he also says that we should be bold and press on with our small contingent. For, as he writes, there’s no turning back now, since the King surely knows our plans. What do you think?</p>

<p>A perilous gash, a very limb lopped off!</p>
<p>And yet, in faith, it is not. His present want</p>
<p>Seems more than we shall find it. Were it good</p>
<p>To set the exact wealth of all our states</p>
<p>All at one cast? To set so rich a main</p>
<p>On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?</p>

<p>It’s a perilous wound, like losing a limb. And yet, truly, it’s not that bad; the loss of my father seems worse than it is. After all, is it a good idea to bet all our resources on one throw of the dice? Or to gamble such a rich stake on a single hazardous event? No, because that would mean we had reached the end of our hope, and the very limit of our luck.</p>

<p>But yet I would your father had been here.</p>
<p>The quality and hair of our attempt</p>
<p>Brooks no division. It will be thought</p>
<p>By some that know not why he is away</p>
<p>That wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislike</p>
<p>Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence.</p>
<p>And think how such an apprehension</p>
<p>May turn the tide of fearful faction</p>
<p>And breed a kind of question in our cause.</p>
<p>For well you know, we of the off’ring side</p>
<p>Must keep aloof from strict arbitrament,</p>
<p>And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence</p>
<p>The eye of reason may pry in upon us.</p>
<p>This absence of your father’s draws a curtain</p>
<p>That shows the ignorant a kind of fear</p>
<p>Before not dreamt of.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>WORCESTER</b>
<p>I still wish your father were here. Our endeavor here won’t withstand any division. People who don’t realize your father is sick will assume that he knows some kind of secret, or that he is loyal to the King, or that he doesn’t approve of how we’re handling things. And just imagine how that kind of mistrust could frighten our more timid supporters, and lead them to doubt us. You know very well that the challenger must always avoid careful examination. We must seal every crack, every loophole, which skeptics might look through to see weaknesses. Your father’s absence draws the curtains back and reveals frightful things to ignorant people, who had never had a reason to fear before.</p>

<p>You strain too far.</p>
<p>I rather of his absence make this use:</p>
<p>It lends a luster and more great opinion,</p>
<p>A larger dare, to our great enterprise</p>
<p>Than if the Earl were here, for men must think</p>
<p>If we without his help can make a head</p>
<p>To push against a kingdom, with his help</p>
<p>We shall o’erturn it topsy-turvy down.</p>
<p>Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>HOTSPUR</b>
<p>You’re taking this too far. I’d rather think about his absence this way: it makes us look even better. It makes our great undertaking seem even more daring than it would if Northumberland were here. People will think that if we can raise an army against the King without my father, that once he joins we’ll turn the whole kingdom upside down. Everything is fine, we’re all in one piece.</p>
