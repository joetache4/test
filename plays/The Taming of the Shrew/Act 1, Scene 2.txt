  - os: "Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO"
    ms: "PETRUCHIO enters with his servant GRUMIO."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Verona, for a while I take my leave,"
      - "To see my friends in Padua, but of all"
      - "My best belovèd and approvèd friend,"
      - "Hortensio. And I trow this is his house."
      - "Here, sirrah Grumio. Knock, I say."
    m:
      - "Farewell, Verona! I’m off to visit my friends in Padua—particularly my best friend Hortensio. And I think this is his house. Here, you there, Grumio. Knock."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Knock, sir? Whom should I knock? Is there any man has rebused your Worship?"
    m:
      - "Knock, sir? Whom should I knock? Has anyone offended your Worship?"

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Villain, I say, knock me here soundly."
    m:
      - "Moron! I’m telling you to make a fist and pound."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you here, sir?"
    m:
      - "Really, sir, I hardly think it would be appropriate for me to pound you."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Villain, I say, knock me at this gate"
      - "And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate."
    m:
      - "Moron, here we are at the gate. Now put your fists to work, or I’ll put mine to work on your head!"

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,"
      - "And then I know after who comes by the worst."
    m:
      - "My master is being difficult. If I do as he asks I think I know which one of us will be sorrier—and it’s not going to be him!"

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Will it not be?"
      - "Faith, sirrah, an you’ll not knock, I’ll ring it."
      - "I’ll try how you can *sol, fa,* and sing it."
    m:
      - "What are you standing there for! If you won’t knock, I’ll ring—and you’ll be singing along in falsetto!"

  - os: "He wrings him by the ears"
    ms: "He grabs him by the ears."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Help, mistress, help! My master is mad."
    m:
      - "*(to the unseen mistress or master of the house)* Help, mistress, help! My master has gone mad."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Now knock when I bid you, sirrah villain."
    m:
      - "Next time maybe you’ll knock when I tell you, punk kid!"

  - os: "Enter HORTENSIO"
    ms: "HORTENSIO enters."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "How now, what’s the matter? My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio? How do you all at Verona?"
    m:
      - "Say, what’s the trouble? If it isn’t my old friend Grumio—and my dear friend Petruchio! How’s everyone in Verona?"

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?"
      - "*Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,* may I say."
    m:
      - "Hortensio, have you come to break up the fight? *Con tutto il cuore ben trovato,* if I may say so."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor mio"
      - "Petruchio.—Rise, Grumio, rise. We will compound this quarrel."
    m:
      - "*Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor mio Petruchio!* Get up, Grumio. We’ll settle this quarrel."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Nay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he ’leges in Latin. If this be not a lawful case for me to leave his service—look you, sir: he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it fit for a servant to use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see, two-and-thirty, a pip out?"
      - "Whom, would to God, I had well knocked at first,"
      - "Then had not Grumio come by the worst."
    m:
      - "I don’t care what he told you in Latin. If this isn’t legal justification for me to leave his service, I don’t know what is. He tells me to knock him, pound him, and put my fists to work on him. Well, I ask you, was that any way for a servant to behave toward his master—especially when he’s clearly a bit crazy. I wish I *had* hit him. I think I’d feel a lot better."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "A senseless villain, good Hortensio."
      - "I bade the rascal knock upon your gate"
      - "And could not get him for my heart to do it."
    m:
      - "He’s a worthless dog, Hortensio. I told him to knock at your gate and for the life of me could not get him to do it."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words plain: “Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly”? And come you now with “knocking at the gate”?"
    m:
      - "Knock at the gate? Oh, for Pete’s sake! Didn’t you clearly say “Knock,” “pound,” and “put your fists to work”? Now you say it was “Knock at the gate”?"

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Sirrah, begone or talk not, I advise you."
    m:
      - "Grumio, either leave or shut up. I’m warning you."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Petruchio, patience. I am Grumio’s pledge."
      - "Why, this’ a heavy chance ’twixt him and you,"
      - "Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio."
      - "And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale"
      - "Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?"
    m:
      - "Easy, Petruchio. I’ll vouch for Grumio. It’s terrible—you two fighting! Faithful, funny old Grumio! You guys go way back! Now, my dear friend, what lucky wind blows you in from Verona?"

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Such wind as scatters young men through the world"
      - "To seek their fortunes farther than at home,"
      - "Where small experience grows. But in a few,"
      - "Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:"
      - "Antonio, my father, is deceased,"
      - "And I have thrust myself into this maze,"
      - "Happily to wive and thrive as best I may."
      - "Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,"
      - "And so am come abroad to see the world."
    m:
      - "The wind that scatters young men throughout the world, encouraging them to seek their fortunes some place other than home, where there’s little to be found in the way of experience. But to be brief, Hortensio, the situation is that my father, Antonio, is dead, and I have set off into this crazy world to see if I can marry well and make a good life for myself. I have money in my purse and property at home, so I’m off to see the world."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee"
      - "And wish thee to a shrewd, ill-favored wife?"
      - "Thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel;"
      - "And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich,"
      - "And very rich. But thou’rt too much my friend,"
      - "And I’ll not wish thee to her."
    m:
      - "Petruchio, shall I be frank? I know where you can find a shrewish and unpleasant wife. I doubt you’d thank me in the end, but she’s rich, all right, very rich. But you’re too good a friend for me to wish her on you."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Signior Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we"
      - "Few words suffice. And therefore, if thou know"
      - "One rich enough to be Petruchio’s wife,"
      - "As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,"
      - "Be she as foul as was Florentius’ love,"
      - "As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd"
      - "As Socrates’ Xanthippe, or a worse,"
      - "She moves me not, or not removes at least"
      - "Affection’s edge in me, were she as rough"
      - "As are the swelling Adriatic seas."
      - "I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;"
      - "If wealthily, then happily in Padua."
    m:
      - "Hortensio, good friends like us can get by on a few words. If you can find a woman rich enough for me—because money is all I look for in a wife—let her be as ugly as Flotentius’ love, as old as the Sibyl, and as bad-tempered as Xanthippe. It wouldn’t matter one way or the other. I’ve come here in search of a rich wife. If I find a rich wife in Padua, I’ll have found a good wife in Padua."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "*(to HORTENSIO)* Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is. Why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne’er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses. Why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal."
    m:
      - "*(to HORTENSIO)* He’s certainly frank, isn’t he, sir? Give him enough money and he’ll be happy with a puppet, a paper doll, or a diseased old hag without a tooth in her head. If she’s got money, what does it matter?"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Petruchio, since we are stepped thus far in,"
      - "I will continue that I broached in jest."
      - "I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife"
      - "With wealth enough, and young and beauteous,"
      - "Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman."
      - "Her only fault, and that is faults enough,"
      - "Is that she is intolerable curst,"
      - "And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure"
      - "That, were my state far worser than it is,"
      - "I would not wed her for a mine of gold."
    m:
      - "Petruchio, since the conversation’s gone this far, I may as well carry on with what I mentioned purely as a joke. I can help you find a wife who’s rich, young, beautiful, and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman. Her only flaw—and it’s a big one—is that she’s unbearable, a total witch, so much so that I wouldn’t think of marrying her myself, not even if I were in a worse fix than I am, not for a whole goldmine."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Hortensio, peace. Thou know’st not gold’s effect."
      - "Tell me her father’s name, and ’tis enough;"
      - "For I will board her, though she chide as loud"
      - "As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack."
    m:
      - "Hush, Hortensio. You don’t know what money can buy. Tell me her father’s name—that’s all I need. I will go after her even if her scolding is as deafening as thunder in an autumn rainstorm."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Her father is Baptista Minola,"
      - "An affable and courteous gentleman."
      - "Her name is Katherina Minola,"
      - "Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue."
    m:
      - "Her father is Baptista Minola, a pleasant and courteous gentleman. Her name is Katherina Minola, famous throughout Padua for her scolding tongue."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "I know her father, though I know not her,"
      - "And he knew my deceasèd father well."
      - "I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her,"
      - "And therefore let me be thus bold with you"
      - "To give you over at this first encounter,"
      - "Unless you will accompany me thither."
    m:
      - "I don’t know her, but I know her father and he knew mine well. I won’t sleep until I see her, Hortensio. So I hope you’ll forgive my cutting short this first conversation of ours—unless you want to come with me."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "*(to HORTENSIO)* I pray you, sir, let him go while the humor lasts. O’ my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so. Why, that’s nothing; an he begin once, he’ll rail in his rope tricks. I’ll tell you what sir: an she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir."
    m:
      - "*(to HORTENSIO)* Please, sir, let him go while he’s in this mood. Lord! If she knew him as well as I do, she’d realize how little effect a scolding has on him. At best she may come up with nine or ten abusive things to call him. That’s nothing. Once he starts on her, he’ll rant and rave on an epic scale. In fact, if she even tries to face him down, he’ll throw out a figure of speech that so disfigures her she’ll have no more eyes to see with than a cat. You don’t know him, sir."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,"
      - "For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is."
      - "He hath the jewel of my life in hold,"
      - "His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,"
      - "And her withholds from me and other more,"
      - "Suitors to her and rivals in my love,"
      - "Supposing it a thing impossible,"
      - "For those defects I have before rehearsed,"
      - "That ever Katherina will be wooed."
      - "Therefore this order hath Baptista ta’en,"
      - "That none shall have access unto Bianca"
      - "Till Katherine the curst have got a husband."
    m:
      - "Wait, Petruchio, I should go with you. My own “wealth” is in Baptista’s keeping. His youngest daughter, the beautiful Bianca, is the jewel of my life, and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand. Because he finds it so incredible—owing to those character deficiencies I mentioned before—that any man will ever come courting Katherina, Baptista has therefore issued this edict: that none shall be permitted to court Bianca until that Katherine the shrew finds a husband."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "“Katherine the curst!”"
      - "A title for a maid of all titles the worst."
    m:
      - "“Katherine the shrew!” That’s the worst thing you can call a young woman."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,"
      - "And offer me disguised in sober robes"
      - "To old Baptista as a schoolmaster"
      - "Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca,"
      - "That so I may, by this device at least,"
      - "Have leave and leisure to make love to her"
      - "And, unsuspected, court her by herself."
    m:
      - "Now my friend Petruchio will help me out, presenting me to old Baptista as a schoolmaster for Bianca well-versed in music. I’ll disguise myself in somber robes. In this costume, I’ll be able to spend time with her alone, which will give me plenty of opportunity to court her."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Here’s no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the young folks lay their heads together!"
    m:
      - "Oh, *very* nice! See how the young folks conspire to fool the old folks!"

  - os: "Enter GREMIO and LUCENTIO disguised as CAMBIO"
    ms: "GREMIO enters with LUCENTIO, disguised as CAMBIO."

  - o:
      - "Master, master, look about you. Who goes there, ha?"
    m:
      - "Master, master, look! Who are these people?"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Peace, Grumio. It is the rival of my love."
      - "Petruchio, stand by a while."
    m:
      - "Hush, Grumio. It is my rival for Bianca. Petruchio, let’s stand over here awhile."

  - os: "PETRUCHIO, HORTENSIO, and GRUMIO stand aside"
    ms: "PETRUCHIO, HORTENSIO, and GRUMIO stand off to the side."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "*(aside)* A proper stripling, and an amorous."
    m:
      - "*(to the audience, indicating old GREMIO)* Check out this stud! What a heartthrob!"

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "*(to LUCENTIO)* O, very well, I have perused the note."
      - "Hark you, sir: I’ll have them very fairly bound,"
      - "All books of love. See that at any hand,"
      - "And see you read no other lectures to her."
      - "You understand me. Over and beside"
      - "Signior Baptista’s liberality,"
      - "I’ll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too."
      - "And let me have them very well perfum’d"
      - "For she is sweeter than perfume itself"
      - "To whom they go to. What will you read to her?"
    m:
      - "*(to LUCENTIO)* Oh, all right, I’ve reviewed the list of books. But listen: I want them very handsomely bound—only books of love, make sure of that in any case. And see that you give her no other lessons. Do I make myself clear? Over and above what Signior Baptista pays you, I’ll tack on a bonus. Take these notes, too. And make sure they’re pleasantly perfumed. The lady they are meant for is sweeter than perfume itself. What are you planning to read her?"

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "*(as CAMBIO)* Whate’er I read to her, I’ll plead for you"
      - "As for my patron, stand you so assured,"
      - "As firmly as yourself were still in place,"
      - "Yea, and perhaps with more successful words"
      - "Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir."
    m:
      - "*(speaking as CAMBIO)* Whatever I read her, you can be sure that I’ll plead the case for your love as strongly as if you yourself stood there before her—and perhaps even a bit more successfully than you would do, sir, seeing as you’re not a scholar."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "O this learning, what a thing it is!"
    m:
      - "Oh, what an excellent thing this learning is!"

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "*(aside)* O this woodcock, what an ass it is!"
    m:
      - "*(speaking to the audience)* Oh, what an asinine thing this moron is!"

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "*(aside)* Peace, sirrah!"
    m:
      - "*(speaking so that only GRUMIO can hear)* Silence, boy!"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "*(aside)* Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio."
    m:
      - "*(speaking so that only GRUMIO can hear)* Grumio, hush! *(to GREMIO, who can’t hear him)* God save you, Signior Gremio."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "And you are well met, Signior Hortensio."
      - "Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola."
      - "I promised to enquire carefully"
      - "About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca,"
      - "And by good fortune I have lighted well"
      - "On this young man, for learning and behavior"
      - "Fit for her turn, well read in poetry"
      - "And other books—good ones, I warrant ye."
    m:
      - "Good to see you, Signior Hortensio. Do you know where I’m going? To Baptista Minola’s house. I promised to look into schoolmasters for Miss Bianca, and luck has led me to this young man, perfectly suited in learning and fine manners, well read in poetry and other books—all of them good, I assure you."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "’Tis well. And I have met a gentleman"
      - "Hath promised me to help me to another,"
      - "A fine musician to instruct our mistress."
      - "So shall I no whit be behind in duty"
      - "To fair Bianca, so beloved of me."
    m:
      - "That’s great. And I have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love. I wouldn’t want to fall behind in my devotion to my beloved Bianca."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "Beloved of me, and that my deeds shall prove."
    m:
      - "*My* beloved—as my actions will prove."

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "*(aside)* And that his bags shall prove."
    m:
      - "*(speaking to the audience)* As his moneybags will prove."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Gremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love."
      - "Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,"
      - "I’ll tell you news indifferent good for either."
      - "*(presenting PETRUCHIO)*"
      - "Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,"
      - "Upon agreement from us to his liking,"
      - "Will undertake to woo curst Katherine,"
      - "Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please."
    m:
      - "Gremio, this is no time to compete over how deeply we love Bianca. Be nice and listen to me a moment, and I’ll give you a piece of news that’s equally good for both of us. *(presenting PETRUCHIO)* Here is a gentleman I happened to meet who, if we can come to an arrangement that would be to his liking, is willing to undertake to woo fierce Katherine—yes, even willing to marry her, if the price is right."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "So said, so done, is well."
      - "Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?"
    m:
      - "That’s good, if he’ll really do it. Have you told him all her faults, Hortensio?"

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "I know she is an irksome brawling scold."
      - "If that be all, masters, I hear no harm."
    m:
      - "I know she is a hateful, brawling scold. If that’s all, gentlemen, I see no problem."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "No? Say’st me so, friend? What countryman?"
    m:
      - "No? Tell me, friend. Where are you from?"

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Born in Verona, old Antonio’s son."
      - "My father dead, my fortune lives for me."
      - "And I do hope good days and long to see."
    m:
      - "Born in Verona. I’m old Antonio’s son. My father’s dead, and his fortune is mine now. I hope to see good days—and many of them."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "O sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!"
      - "But if you have a stomach, to ’t, i’ God’s name:"
      - "You shall have me assisting you in all."
      - "But will you woo this wildcat?"
    m:
      - "Sir, such a life with such a wife is unlikely! But if you have the stomach for it, you’ll have all the help from me you need. Do you really mean to go after this wildcat?"

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "    Will I live?"
    m:
      - "Do I mean to go on breathing?"

  - sp: GRUMIO
    o:
      - "Will he woo her? Ay, or I’ll hang her."
    m:
      - "He’ll woo her or I’ll hang her."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Why came I hither but to that intent?"
      - "Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?"
      - "Have I not in my time heard lions roar?"
      - "Have I not heard the sea, puffed up with winds,"
      - "Rage like an angry boar chafèd with sweat?"
      - "Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,"
      - "And heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies?"
      - "Have I not in a pitchèd battle heard"
      - "Loud ’larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets’ clang?"
      - "And do you tell me of a woman’s tongue"
      - "That gives not half so great a blow to hear"
      - "As will a chestnut in a farmer’s fire?"
      - "Tush, tush! Fear boys with bugs."

I, who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals? I, who have heard the rumble of guns in battle—and thunder in the sky (heaven’s version of artillery). Have I not stood in the middle of a battle, with loud calls to arms, horses neighing, and trumpets sounding all around me? And you worry how I’ll react to a woman’s tongue, which isn’t even as loud as the *pop!* of a chestnut roasting in some farmer’s oven? Please. Scare children with your bugaboos."
