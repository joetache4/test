<p>Yea, marry, there’s the point.</p>

<b>LORD BARDOLPH</b>
<p>Yes, exactly, and that’s the point. If we’re too weak without him, then I don’t think we should advance until we know that his help is guaranteed.

<p>It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,</p>

<p>Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts,</p>

<b>LORD BARDOLPH</b>
<p>That’s true, my lord. Hotspur fortified himself with nothing but hope, and mistook empty words as a true promise of reinforcements. He imagined that a huge army was coming to his aid, but what actually arrived turned out to be even smaller than the smallest of his fantasies. And so, with daydreams that could only belong to a madman, he closed his eyes and leaped into destruction.</p>

<p>Yes, if this present quality of war—</p>
<p>Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot—</p>
<p>Lives so in hope, as in an early spring</p>
<p>We see the appearing buds, which to prove fruit</p>
<p>Hope gives not so much warrant as despair</p>
<p>That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,</p>
<p>We first survey the plot, then draw the model,</p>
<p>And when we see the figure of the house,</p>
<p>Then must we rate the cost of the erection,</p>
<p>Which if we find outweighs ability,</p>
<p>What do we then but draw anew the model</p>
<p>In fewer offices, or at last desist</p>
<p>To build at all? Much more in this great work,</p>
<p>Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down</p>
<p>And set another up, should we survey</p>
<p>The plot of situation and the model,</p>
<p>Consent upon a sure foundation,</p>
<p>Question surveyors, know our own estate,</p>
<p>How able such a work to undergo,</p>
<p>To weigh against his opposite. Or else</p>
<p>We fortify in paper and in figures,</p>
<p>Using the names of men instead of men,</p>
<p>Like one that draws the model of a house</p>
<p>Beyond his power to build it, who, half through,</p>
<p>Gives o’er and leaves his part-created cost</p>
<p>A naked subject to the weeping clouds</p>
<p>And waste for churlish winter’s tyranny.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>LORD BARDOLPH</b>
<p>Yes, there is. Presently, our armies are already in motion, but putting our hope in them is as ridiculous as expecting that early spring buds will produce fruit: at that time of year, buds are more likely to be killed by frost than to bloom. When we want to put up a building, first we survey the land, and then we draw up a set of plans. Then we calculate the cost, and if we can’t afford it, we revise the plans with fewer rooms, or we decide not to build at all. In the great task we’re attempting—the taking down of one kingdom, and the building of another—we have even more reason to evaluate the land and the plans. We must be certain that the foundation is sound, that the engineer is skilled. We must know precisely what we can afford, how ready and able we are, and we must consider the opposing arguments. Otherwise, it becomes a meaningless exercise: papers and numbers, and names of men rather than real, live men. That’s like drawing up plans for a house you can’t possibly afford, building half of it, and then abandoning the partly-built structure to be ruined by the elements.</p>

<p>To us no more, nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph,</p>

<b>HASTINGS</b>
<p>The King isn’t facing us with any more than that—in fact, he doesn’t even have that many, Lord Bardolph. This is a time of war, and the King’s had to divide his army into three sections. One division is fighting the French; one’s fighting Glendower. That leaves a third of his army to fight against us. The King is weak and divided into three, and the coffers of his treasury echo with the sounds of hollow poverty and emptiness.</p>

<b>ARCHBISHOP</b>
<p>Let’s continue. We’ll publicly proclaim the reasons we’re fighting. The people are sick of the leadership they themselves supported. They were greedy for it, but now they have overfed. When you build your foundation on the public’s love, you build on shaky and unsure ground. Oh, you foolish masses! You shouted your love for Bolingbroke to the skies, before you knew what he’d turn into. Now that you’re dressed in the things you desired, you monstrous devourer, you’re so full of Bolingbroke that you’re ready to vomit him up. This, you vulgar dog, is just how you emptied your gluttonous stomach of King Richard; and now you want to eat up your dead vomit, and you howl trying to find it. What can you count on in this world? The very people who wanted Richard dead when he was alive are now in love with his corpse. The very people who threw garbage on his noble head when he marched through London in shame behind the admired Bolingbroke are now saying, “Oh Earth, return that King, and take this one!” Curses on men’s thoughts! Only the past and the future appeal to them; whatever they have right now they despise.</p>
