    ms: "A trumpet sounds. CAESAR enters, followed by ANTONY, dressed formally for a foot race, then CALPHURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS, CICERO, BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and CASCA. A great crowd follows, among them a SOOTHSAYER."

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "Forget not in your speed, Antonius,"
      - "To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say"
      - "The barren, touchèd in this holy chase,"
      - "Shake off their sterile curse."
    m:
      - "Antonius, after you take off, don’t forget to touch Calphurnia, because our wise elders say that if you touch an infertile woman during this holy race, she’ll be freed from the curse of sterility."

    o:
      - "    I shall remember."
      - "When Caesar says, “do this,” it is performed."

      - "I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,"
      - "Cry “Caesar!”—Speak. Caesar is turned to hear."
    m:
      - "Who in the crowd is calling me? I hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling “Caesar!” Speak. Caesar is listening."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "Will you go see the order of the course?"
    m:
      - "Are you going to watch the race?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Not I."
    m:
      - "Not me."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "I pray you, do."
    m:
      - "Please, come."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "I am not gamesome. I do lack some part"
      - "Of that quick spirit that is in Antony."
      - "Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires."
      - "I’ll leave you."
    m:
      - "I don’t like sports. I’m not competitive like Antony. But don’t let me keep you from going, Cassius. I’ll go my own way."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "Brutus, I do observe you now of late"
      - "I have not from your eyes that gentleness"
      - "And show of love as I was wont to have."
      - "You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand"
      - "Over your friend that loves you."
    m:
      - "Brutus, I’ve been watching you lately. You seem less good-natured and affectionate toward me than usual. You’ve been stubborn and unfamiliar with me, your friend who loves you."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "    Cassius,"
      - "Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look,"
      - "I turn the trouble of my countenance"
      - "Merely upon myself. Vexèd I am"
      - "Of late with passions of some difference,"
      - "Conceptions only proper to myself,"
      - "Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors."
      - "But let not therefore, my good friends, be grieved—"
      - "Among which number, Cassius, be you one—"
      - "Nor construe any further my neglect"
      - "Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,"
      - "Forgets the shows of love to other men."
    m:
      - "Cassius, don’t take it badly. If I seem guarded, it’s only because I’m uneasy with *myself*. Lately I’ve been overwhelmed with private thoughts and inner conflicts, which have affected my behavior. But this shouldn’t trouble my good friends—and I consider you a good friend, Cassius. Don’t think anything more about my distraction than that poor Brutus, who is at war with himself, forgets to show affection to others."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,"
      - "By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried"
      - "Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations."
      - "Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?"
    m:
      - "Brutus, I misunderstood your feelings, and therefore kept to myself certain thoughts I might have shared. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself"
      - "But by reflection, by some other things."
    m:
      - "No, Cassius. The eye can’t see itself, except by reflection in other surfaces."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "’Tis just."
      - "And it is very much lamented, Brutus,"
      - "That you have no such mirrors as will turn"
      - "Your hidden worthiness into your eye"
      - "That you might see your shadow. I have heard"
      - "Where many of the best respect in Rome,"
      - "Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus"
      - "And groaning underneath this age’s yoke,"
      - "Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes."
    m:
      - "That’s true. And it’s too bad, Brutus, that you don’t have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself. I’ve heard many of the noblest Romans—next to immortal Caesar—speaking of you, complaining of the tyranny of today’s government, and wishing that your eyes were working better."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,"
      - "That you would have me seek into myself"
      - "For that which is not in me?"
    m:
      - "What dangers are you trying to lead me into, Cassius, that you want me to look inside myself for something that’s not there?"

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear."
      - "And since you know you cannot see yourself"
      - "So well as by reflection, I, your glass,"
      - "Will modestly discover to yourself"
      - "That of yourself which you yet know not of."
      - "And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus."
      - "Were I a common laugher, or did use"
      - "To stale with ordinary oaths my love"
      - "To every new protester, if you know"
      - "That I do fawn on men and hug them hard"
      - "And, after, scandal them, or if you know"
      - "That I profess myself in banqueting"
      - "To all the rout, then hold me dangerous."
    m:
      - "I’ll tell you, good Brutus. And since you know you can see yourself best by reflection, I’ll be your mirror and show you, without exaggeration, things inside you that you can’t see. And don’t be suspicious of me, noble Brutus. If I were your average fool, or if I made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody, or if you’d seen me first flattering men, hugging them tightly, and later slandering them behind their backs, or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble, only then, of course, go ahead and assume I’m dangerous."

  - os: "Flourish, and shout within"
    ms: "Trumpets play offstage, and then a shout is heard."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "What means this shouting? I do fear, the people"
      - "Choose Caesar for their king."
    m:
      - "Why are they shouting? I’m afraid the people have made Caesar their king."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "    Ay, do you fear it?"
      - "Then must I think you would not have it so."
    m:
      - "Really, are you afraid of that? Then I have to assume you don’t want him to be king."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "I would not, Cassius. Yet I love him well."
      - "But wherefore do you hold me here so long?"
      - "What is it that you would impart to me?"
      - "If it be aught toward the general good,"
      - "Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other,"
      - "And I will look on both indifferently,"
      - "For let the gods so speed me as I love"
      - "The name of honor more than I fear death."
    m:
      - "I don’t, Cassius, though I love Caesar very much. But why do you keep me here so long? What do you want to tell me? If it’s for the good of all Romans, I’d do it even if it meant my death. Let the gods give me good luck only as long as I love honor more than I fear death."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,"
      - "As well as I do know your outward favor."
      - "Well, honor is the subject of my story."
      - "I cannot tell what you and other men"
      - "Think of this life, but, for my single self,"
      - "I had as lief not be as live to be"
      - "In awe of such a thing as I myself."
      - "I was born free as Caesar. So were you."
      - "We both have fed as well, and we can both"
      - "Endure the winter’s cold as well as he."
      - "For once upon a raw and gusty day,"
      - "The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,"
      - "Caesar said to me, “Darest thou, Cassius, now"
      - "Leap in with me into this angry flood"
      - "And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,"
      - "Accoutred as I was, I plungèd in"
      - "And bade him follow. So indeed he did."
      - "The torrent roared, and we did buffet it"
      - "With lusty sinews, throwing it aside"
      - "And stemming it with hearts of controversy."
      - "But ere we could arrive the point proposed,"
      - "Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!”"
      - "I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,"
      - "Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder"
      - "The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber"
      - "Did I the tired Caesar. And this man"
      - "Is now become a god, and Cassius is"
      - "A wretched creature and must bend his body"
      - "If Caesar carelessly but nod on him."
      - "He had a fever when he was in Spain,"
      - "And when the fit was on him, I did mark"
      - "How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake!"
      - "His coward lips did from their color fly,"
      - "And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world"
      - "Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan,"
      - "Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans"
      - "Mark him and write his speeches in their books—"
      - "“Alas,” it cried, “give me some drink, Titinius,”"
      - "As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me"
      - "A man of such a feeble temper should"
      - "So get the start of the majestic world"
      - "And bear the palm alone."
    m:
      - "I know this quality in you, Brutus—it’s as familiar to me as your face. Indeed, honor is what I want to talk to you about. I don’t know what you and other men think of this life, but as for me, I’d rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself. I was born as free as Caesar. So were you. We both have eaten as well, and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he. Once, on a cold and windy day, when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks, Caesar said to me, “Cassius, I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there.” As soon as he spoke, though I was fully dressed, I plunged in and called for him to follow. And he did. The water roared, and we fought against it with vigorous arms. And, thanks to our fierce competitiveness, we made progress. But before we reached the end point, Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I will sink!” And just as Aeneas, the hero who founded Rome, emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder, so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar. And this is the man who has now become a god, and I’m a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way. In Spain, Caesar had a fever, and it made him shake. It’s true, this so-called “god”—he shook. His cowardly lips turned white, and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam. I heard him groan—yes, I did—and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried, “Give me some water, Titinius,” like a sick girl. It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone."

  - os: "Shout within. Flourish"
    ms: "A shout offstage. Trumpets play."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "    Another general shout!"
      - "I do believe that these applauses are"
      - "For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar."
    m:
      - "More shouting! I think this applause is for some new honors awarded to Caesar."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world"
      - "Like a Colossus, and we petty men"
      - "Walk under his huge legs and peep about"
      - "To find ourselves dishonorable graves."
      - "Men at some time are masters of their fates."
      - "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars"
      - "But in ourselves, that we are underlings."
      - "Brutus and Caesar—what should be in that “Caesar”?"
      - "Why should that name be sounded more than yours?"
      - "Write them together, yours is as fair a name."
      - "Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well."
      - "Weigh them, it is as heavy. Conjure with ’em,"
      - "“Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.”"
      - "Now in the names of all the gods at once,"
      - "Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed"
      - "That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!"
      - "Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!"
      - "When went there by an age, since the great flood,"
      - "But it was famed with more than with one man?"
      - "When could they say till now, that talked of Rome,"
      - "That her wide walks encompassed but one man?"
      - "Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,"
      - "When there is in it but one only man."
      - "Oh, you and I have heard our fathers say,"
      - "There was a Brutus once that would have brooked"
      - "Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome"
      - "As easily as a king."
    m:
      - "Why, Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant, and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably, as slaves. Men can be masters of their fate. It is not destiny’s fault, but our own faults, that we’re slaves. “Brutus” and “Caesar.” What’s so special about “Caesar”? Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours? Write them together—yours is just as good a name. Pronounce them—it is just as nice to say. Weigh them—it’s just as heavy. Cast spells with them, and “Brutus” will call up a ghost as well as “Caesar.” Now, in the name of all the gods, I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great? Our era should be ashamed! Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men! When was there ever an age, since the beginning of time, that didn’t feature more than one famous man? Until now, no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome. Now, though, in all of Rome, there’s room for only one man. You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus—your ancestor—who would’ve let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "That you do love me, I am nothing jealous."
      - "What you would work me to, I have some aim."
      - "How I have thought of this and of these times"
      - "I shall recount hereafter. For this present,"
      - "I would not, so with love I might entreat you,"
      - "Be any further moved. What you have said"
      - "I will consider, what you have to say"
      - "I will with patience hear, and find a time"
      - "Both meet to hear and answer such high things."
      - "Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:"
      - "Brutus had rather be a villager"
      - "Than to repute himself a son of Rome"
      - "Under these hard conditions as this time"
      - "Is like to lay upon us."
    m:
      - "I have no doubt that you love me. I’m beginning to understand what you want me to do. What I think about this, and about what’s happening here in Rome, I’ll tell you later. For now, don’t try to persuade me anymore—I ask you as a friend. I’ll think over what you’ve said, I’ll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say, and I’ll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters. Until then, my noble friend, think about this: I’d rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of Rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through."

      - "Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero"
      - "Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes"
      - "As we have seen him in the Capitol"
      - "Being crossed in conference by some senators."
    m:
      - "I’ll do so. But look, Cassius, Caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they’ve been scolded. Calphurnia’s face is pale, and Cicero’s eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the Capitol."

He reads a lot, he’s a keen observer, and he sees the hidden motives in what men do. He doesn’t like plays the way you do, Antony. He doesn’t listen to music. He rarely smiles, and when he does smile, he does so in a self-mocking way, as if he scorns himself for smiling at all. Men like him will never be comfortable while someone ranks higher than themselves, and therefore they’re very dangerous. I’m telling you what should be feared, not what I fear—because after all, I am Caesar. Come over to my right side, because this ear is deaf, and tell me what you really think of Cassius."

Then he offered it to him again, then he put it by again—but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by. And still, as he refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar—for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air."
    m:
      - "I can’t explain it. It was all silly and so I paid no attention. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown—though it wasn’t a real crown, just a small circlet—and, as I told you, he refused it once—though in my opinion he would’ve liked to have it. Then Antony offered it to him again, and he refused it again (though, in my opinion, he was reluctant to take his hand off it). Then Antony offered it the third time. He refused it the third time, and as he refused it the commoners hooted and clapped their chapped hands, and threw up their sweaty hats, and let loose such a great deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it nearly choked Caesar, because he fainted and fell down.

An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed to be taken of them. If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less."

If I’d been a common laborer and hadn’t taken him up on his offer, to hell with me. And so he fainted. When he regained consciousness again, he said that if he’d done or said anything wrong, he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness. Three or four women near me cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But never mind them—if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would’ve forgiven him."
