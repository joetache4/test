<p>Angelo,</p>
<p>There is a kind of character in thy life,</p>
<p>That to the observer doth thy history</p>
<p>Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings</p>
<p>Are not thine own so proper as to waste</p>
<p>Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.</p>
<p>Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,</p>
<p>Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues</p>
<p>Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike</p>
<p>As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch’d</p>
<p>But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends</p>
<p>The smallest scruple of her excellence</p>
<p>But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines</p>
<p>Herself the glory of a creditor,</p>
<p>Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech</p>
<p>To one that can my part in him advertise;</p>
<p>Hold therefore, Angelo:—</p>
<p>In our remove be thou at full ourself;</p>
<p>Mortality and mercy in Vienna</p>
<p>Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,</p>
<p>Though first in question, is thy secondary.</p>
<p>Take thy commission.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b>
<p>Angelo, there is a distinctive pattern to your life that tells people what sort of man you are. But your talents don’t belong to you alone, and you mustn’t waste them by keeping them to yourself. Heaven uses us the way we use a torch—not to shine for itself, but to shed light onto the world. If we don’t use our talents in the world, it would be the same as if we didn’t have those talents at all. People are given certain natures to accomplish certain things. Mother Nature doesn’t lend you even a smidgen of talent without expecting you to pay her back—with interest and gratitude. But here I am talking to someone who could instruct me! So, stand firm, Angelo—in my absence, you’ll stand in for me completely. Vienna’s criminals will be executed or pardoned based on what you feel and say. Although old Escalus is senior to you, he’ll be your second-in-command. Take your written orders.</p>

<p>Too seriously, I’m afraid. Since it was my fault to give the people so much freedom, I’d seem like a real tyrant now to whip them for things I allowed them to do. We essentially tell people to misbehave when we give evil deeds a pass and don’t punish them. So, friar, I’ve given the job to Angelo. He can effectively deal with this, in my name—but since I’m not personally involved, I won’t look bad. To see how he rules, I’d like to visit him and the people disguised as one of your order’s monks. So please furnish me with a robe and teach me how to behave like a real friar. When there’s more time, I’ll give you additional reasons for my actions. For now, I’ll tell you this one: Lord Angelo is a puritanical man, constantly guarding himself against desire, the type who barely admits blood flows in his veins. So if power changes a person’s principles, we’ll see how he really is.</p>

<p>By those that know the very nerves of state,</p>
<p>His givings-out were of an infinite distance</p>
<p>From his true-meant design. Upon his place,</p>

<p>Is very snow-broth; one who never feels</p>
<p>The wanton stings and motions of the sense,</p>
<p>But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge</p>
<p>With profits of the mind, study and fast.</p>
<p>He—to give fear to use and liberty,</p>
<p>Which have for long run by the hideous law,</p>
<p>As mice by lions—hath pick’d out an act,</p>
<p>Under whose heavy sense your brother’s life</p>
<p>Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;</p>
<p>And follows close the rigour of the statute,</p>
<p>To make him an example. All hope is gone,</p>

<p>Here’s the problem. The duke has mysteriously left town. He deluded many men—myself included—with the hope of some military action. But now we hear from government insiders that his publicly announced reasons for leaving were far from his real plans. In his place, and with his full authority, Lord Angelo rules. This is a man whose blood is like melted snow, never warmed by uncontrolled lust, but who represses and dulls his natural appetites with exercises for the mind—studying and fasting. To scare folks who are habitually promiscuous and have evaded the law like mice running past a lion, he’s found a severe act that, if taken literally, would cost your brother his life. He’s arrested him under it and plans to make an example of him by strictly applying this law. All hope is gone, unless you can soften Angelo with your pretty prayers. That’s the essence of this errand between you and your poor brother.</p>

<p>Yes, but we should also be precise. Better to use a scalpel than a hatchet, cutting carefully instead of chopping to death. This gentleman whose life I’d like to save had such a noble father. I know you’re a completely disciplined, virtuous man. But imagine you felt sexual stirrings for a woman, and you were in the right place at the right time, and by acting on that desire you could have her.

<p>It’s one thing to be tempted, Escalus, but another thing to give in. I don’t deny that the twelve members of a jury might include a thief or two who are far guiltier than the prisoner they’re passing sentence on. But justice takes the opportunities it has; who knows what laws thieves pass against other thieves? Obviously, if we stumble across a jewel in the road, we’ll bend down and take it, because we see it. But things we don’t see, we step over and never think about. You can’t excuse his crime on the grounds that I could have done the same thing. Instead, if I—the man who’s condemning him—commit the same offense, let this verdict of mine act as a precedent for my death, and let no allowances be made for me. Sir, he must die.</p>

<p>If men of power could thunder and wield lightning as the god Jove himself does, Jove would never have any peace, for every puny, petty official would use his heaven for thunder, nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven, you use your sharp, sulfur-scented lightning bolts to split the hard gnarled oak tree, rather than the soft myrtle bush. But give a proud man a little bit of temporary authority and he forgets what it means to be made in God’s image. Instead, like an angry ape that mimics people’s behavior, he does such incredibly grotesque things before high heaven that the angels, if they were human, would either weep or die laughing.</p>

<p>From you, and from your virtue, too! What’s happening? Is this her fault or mine? The tempter or the tempted, who sins the most? Ha! It’s not her, she’s not trying to be a tempter. It’s me. It’s like I’m lying in a field of violets, only instead of blossoming and smelling like a flower, I’m rotting and stinking like a corpse from the same sun that makes the flowers grow. Is it possible that a modest woman can arouse desire more than a seductive one? Having destroyed enough land already, should a person want to tear down a holy place and establish evil there as well? Oh, damn, damn, damn! Angelo, what are you doing, who are you? Do you sinfully desire her for the things that make her good? Oh, I should let her brother live! Thieves are justified in robbing when the judges themselves are thieves. Can it be I’m in love with her, when I want to hear her speak again, and gaze into her eyes? What am I dreaming of? Oh, the devil’s a cunning enemy—to catch a saint, he baits the hook with saints! The most dangerous temptation is the one that uses our love of goodness to draw us into sin. A prostitute could never attract me, even with her two powers: her seductive skills and her natural endowments. But this virtuous girl totally overwhelms me. Whenever I saw men who were infatuated like idiots, I smiled and didn’t understand—up until now.</p>

<p>Be ready to die; then either death or life will be all the sweeter. Tell life this: if I lose you, I lose something that only fools would want to keep. You’re just a breath, subject to all the changes of weather that hourly buffet the body you occupy. You’re simply death’s dupe, constantly struggling to run away from him, while all the while you’re running toward him. You’re not noble, because all your civilized comforts come from lowly plants and animals. You’re by no means brave, because the forked tongue of a little snake scares you. Sleep is your best way to rest, and you do that a lot, yet you stupidly fear death, which is basically the same thing. You’re not a single being, because you’re composed of thousands of grains of dust. You’re not happy, because you’re always trying to get what you don’t have, and what you do have, you forget about. You’re unstable, your moods changing as often as the phases of the moon. If you’re rich, you’re actually poor—like an ass staggering under a load of gold bars, you’re just carrying your heavy wealth for a period, and you lose that wealth when you die. You don’t have any friends, for even your children—the offspring of your own loins—curse the gout, skin rashes, and colds for not carrying you off sooner. You’re neither old or young, but always suspended in a sort of mid-afternoon nap, because when young, you’re like an old beggar, wheedling money from your feeble elders. And when you’re old and rich yourself, you have neither the passion, love, agility, or beauty to enjoy your wealth. So, what in all this is worth living for? Life hides more than a thousand deaths. Yet it’s death, which fixes all these problems, that we fear.</p>

<p>This maid still loves Angelo. Logically, his unfair cruelty should have ended her love, but it’s actually intensified it, the way water becomes violent and choppy when it hits a barrier. Go to Angelo. Pretend to yield to his request, and obey his demands to the letter. But set some conditions: that you not spend much time together, that it be in the dark, that there be absolute silence, and that it be in a convenient place. When he agrees—and now here’s the key part—we’ll tell the wronged girl to go in your place. If their encounter later comes to light, it might compel him to compensate her. The result of all this: your brother is saved, your honor is maintained, poor Mariana is helped, and the corrupt deputy is punished. I’ll prepare the girl and make her ready for the encounter. If you think you can manage this, the double benefit outweighs any blame for the deception. What do you think?</p>

<p>This thing I’ve done has totally destroyed me. I’m stupid, can’t concentrate on anything. A girl robbed of her virginity, and by a respected public figure who enforced the law against sex! If she weren’t too ashamed to admit it, she could easily denounce me! But her head tells her not to, because my credibility is so strong that any scandal would ruin the person who spreads it, not me. I would’ve let Claudio live, except that a hotheaded youth like him might have come after me someday, feeling that his life is dishonored because he paid such a shameful price for it. Even so, I wish I’d let him live. Sadly, nothing goes right once we forget virtue. I don’t do the good thing, which I don’t want to do, but the evil I don’t want to commit, that I do.</p>

Even the merciful part of the law cries out, “an Angelo for Claudio, death for death!” Haste always results in hasty decisions, and deliberation comes from slowness. One thing is rewarded by a similar thing, and the measure of justice you use will be the measure used against you. So, Angelo, your crime is clear for all to see, and it denies you the right to any preferential treatment, even if you yourself feel otherwise. I sentence you to be executed on the very block where Claudio knelt to die, and just as quickly. Take him away!</p>
