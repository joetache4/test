<b>CASSIUS</b>
<p>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</p>
<p>As well as I do know your outward favor.</p>
<p>Well, honor is the subject of my story.</p>
<p>I cannot tell what you and other men</p>
<p>Think of this life, but, for my single self,</p>
<p>I had as lief not be as live to be</p>
<p>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</p>
<p>I was born free as Caesar. So were you.</p>
<p>We both have fed as well, and we can both</p>
<p>Endure the winter’s cold as well as he.</p>
<p>For once upon a raw and gusty day,</p>
<p>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</p>
<p>Caesar said to me, “Darest thou, Cassius, now</p>
<p>Leap in with me into this angry flood</p>
<p>And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,</p>
<p>Accoutred as I was, I plungèd in</p>
<p>And bade him follow. So indeed he did.</p>
<p>The torrent roared, and we did buffet it</p>
<p>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</p>
<p>And stemming it with hearts of controversy.</p>
<p>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</p>
<p>Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!”</p>
<p>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</p>
<p>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</p>
<p>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</p>
<p>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</p>
<p>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</p>
<p>A wretched creature and must bend his body</p>
<p>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</p>
<p>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</p>
<p>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</p>
<p>How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake!</p>
<p>His coward lips did from their color fly,</p>
<p>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</p>
<p>Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan,</p>
<p>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</p>
<p>Mark him and write his speeches in their books—</p>
<p>“Alas,” it cried, “give me some drink, Titinius,”</p>
<p>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</p>
<p>A man of such a feeble temper should</p>
<p>So get the start of the majestic world</p>
<p>And bear the palm alone.</p>

<b>CASSIUS</b>
<p>I know this quality in you, Brutus—it’s as familiar to me as your face. Indeed, honor is what I want to talk to you about. I don’t know what you and other men think of this life, but as for me, I’d rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself. I was born as free as Caesar. So were you. We both have eaten as well, and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he. Once, on a cold and windy day, when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks, Caesar said to me, “Cassius, I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there.” As soon as he spoke, though I was fully dressed, I plunged in and called for him to follow. And he did. The water roared, and we fought against it with vigorous arms. And, thanks to our fierce competitiveness, we made progress. But before we reached the end point, Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I will sink!” And just as Aeneas, the hero who founded Rome, emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder, so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar. And this is the man who has now become a god, and I’m a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way. In Spain, Caesar had a fever, and it made him shake. It’s true, this so-called “god”—he shook. His cowardly lips turned white, and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam. I heard him groan—yes, I did—and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried, “Give me some water, Titinius,” like a sick girl. It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone.</p>

<p>“Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.”</p>
<p>Now in the names of all the gods at once,</p>

<p>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</p>

<p>That her wide walks encompassed but one man?</p>
<p>Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,</p>

<b>CASSIUS</b>
<p>Why, Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant, and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably, as slaves. Men can be masters of their fate. It is not destiny’s fault, but our own faults, that we’re slaves. “Brutus” and “Caesar.” What’s so special about “Caesar”? Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours? Write them together—yours is just as good a name. Pronounce them—it is just as nice to say. Weigh them—it’s just as heavy. Cast spells with them, and “Brutus” will call up a ghost as well as “Caesar.” Now, in the name of all the gods, I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great? Our era should be ashamed! Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men! When was there ever an age, since the beginning of time, that didn’t feature more than one famous man? Until now, no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome. Now, though, in all of Rome, there’s room for only one man. You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus—your ancestor—who would’ve let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule.</p>

Also—I’ve kept my sword unsheathed since I saw this—in front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me. And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets. And yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon. When all these extraordinary things happen at once, we shouldn’t say, “These happenings can be explained rationally.

<p>It must be by his death, and for my part</p>
<p>I know no personal cause to spurn at him</p>
<p>But for the general. He would be crowned.</p>
<p>How that might change his nature, there’s the question.</p>
<p>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder</p>
<p>And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,</p>
<p>And then I grant we put a sting in him</p>
<p>That at his will he may do danger with.</p>
<p>Th’ abuse of greatness is when it disjoins</p>
<p>Remorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar,</p>
<p>I have not known when his affections swayed</p>
<p>More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof</p>
<p>That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,</p>
<p>Whereto the climber upward turns his face.</p>
<p>But when he once attains the upmost round,</p>
<p>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</p>
<p>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</p>
<p>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</p>
<p>Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel</p>
<p>Will bear no color for the thing he is,</p>
<p>Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,</p>
<p>Would run to these and these extremities.</p>
<p>And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg—</p>
<p>Which, hatched, would as his kind grow mischievous—</p>
<p>And kill him in the shell.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>BRUTUS</b>
<p>The only way is to kill Caesar. I have no personal reason to strike at him—only the best interest of the people. He wants to be crowned. The question is, how would being king change him? Evil can come from good, just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days—which means we have to walk carefully. If we crown him, I have to admit we’d be giving him the power to do damage. Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion. To be honest, I’ve never known Caesar to let his emotions get the better of his reason. But everyone knows that an ambitious young man uses humility to advance himself, but when he reaches the top, he turns his back on his supporters and reaches for the skies while scorning those who helped him get where he is. Caesar might act like that. Therefore, in case he does, we must hold him back. And since our quarrel is with his future behavior, not what he does now, I must frame the argument like this: if his position is furthered, his character will fulfill these predictions. And therefore we should liken him to a serpent’s egg—once it has hatched, it becomes dangerous, like all serpents. Thus we must kill him while he’s still in the shell.</p>

Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim. But if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave—and I think we do—then, countrymen, what else could we possibly need to spur us to action? What bond do we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what they’re going to do and won’t back down? And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying? Swearing is for priests, cowards, overly cautious men, feeble old people, and those long-suffering weaklings who welcome abuse. Only men whom you wouldn’t trust anyway would swear oaths, and for the worst reasons. Don’t spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath, when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastard’s blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made.</p>

Noble friends, let’s kill him boldly but not with anger. Let’s carve him up like a dish fit for the gods, not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs. Let’s be angry only long enough to do the deed, and then let’s act like we’re disgusted by what we had to do. This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful. If we appear calm to the people, they’ll call us surgeons rather than murderers. As for Mark Antony—forget him. He’ll be as useless as Caesar’s arm after Caesar’s head is cut off.</p>

I asked you again, and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently. I still insisted on knowing what the matter was, but you wouldn’t answer me, instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone. So I left, afraid of further provoking anger that was already inflamed but still hoping this was merely moodiness, which everyone is affected by once in awhile. Your strange mood won’t let you eat or talk or sleep. If it had changed your outward appearance as much as it has affected you on the inside, I wouldn’t even be able to recognize you, Brutus.

<p>Caesar, I never believed in omens, but now they frighten me. A servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too, but different ones from what we heard and saw. A lioness gave birth in the streets, and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead. Fierce, fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war—ranks and squadrons—until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol. The noise of battle filled the air, and horses neighed, and dying men groaned, and ghosts shrieked and squealed in the streets. Oh, Caesar! These things are beyond anything we’ve seen before, and I’m afraid.</p>

Yet out of all of them, I know only one who is unassailable, who never moves from his position. To show you that that’s me, let me prove it a little even in this case.

If Brutus will swear that Antony may come to him safely and be convinced that Caesar deserved to be killed, Mark Antony will love dead Caesar not nearly as much as living Brutus, and with true faith he’ll follow the destiny and affairs of noble Brutus through the difficulties of this unprecedented state of affairs.” That’s what my master, Antony, says.</p>

<p>You all did love him once, not without cause.</p>
<p>What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?</p>
<p>O judgment! Thou art fled to brutish beasts,</p>

<b>ANTONY</b>
<p>Friends, Romans, countrymen, give me your attention. I have come here to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do is remembered after their deaths, but the good is often buried with them. It might as well be the same with Caesar. The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious. If that’s true, it’s a serious fault, and Caesar has paid seriously for it. With the permission of Brutus and the others—for Brutus is an honorable man; they are all honorable men—I have come here to speak at Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, he was faithful and just to me. But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. He brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city. Is this the work of an ambitious man? When the poor cried, Caesar cried too. Ambition shouldn’t be so soft. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. You all saw that on the Lupercal feast day I offered him a king’s crown three times, and he refused it three times. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious. And, no question, Brutus is an honorable man. I am not here to disprove what Brutus has said, but to say what <em>I</em> know. You all loved him once, and not without reason. Then what reason holds you back from mourning him now? Men have become brutish beasts and lost their reason! Bear with me. My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, and I must pause until it returns to me. <em>(he weeps)</em></p>

It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors. Look, here’s where Cassius’ dagger pierced it. See the wound that Casca made. Through this hole beloved Brutus stabbed. And when he pulled out his cursed dagger, see how Caesar’s blood came with it, as if rushing out a door to see if it was really Brutus who was knocking so rudely. For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. The gods know how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkind cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, he understood his beloved Brutus’ ingratitude; it was stronger than the violence of traitors, and it defeated him, bursting his mighty heart. And at the base of Pompey’s statue, with his cloak covering his face, which was dripping with blood the whole time, great Caesar fell. Oh, what a fall it was, my countrymen! Then you and I and all of us fell down, while bloody treason triumphed. Oh, now you weep, and I sense that you feel pity. These are gracious tears. But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar’s wounded cloak, how will you feel, kind men, now?

<p>That gave me public leave to speak of him.</p>
<p>For I have neither wit nor words nor worth,</p>
<p>Action nor utterance nor the power of speech,</p>
<p>To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on.</p>
<p>I tell you that which you yourselves do know,</p>
<p>Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,</p>
<p>And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,</p>
<p>And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony</p>
<p>Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue</p>
<p>In every wound of Caesar that should move</p>
<p>The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.</p>

<b>ANTONY</b>
<p>Good friends, sweet friends, don’t let me stir you up to such a sudden mutiny. Those who have done this deed are honorable. I don’t know what private grudges they had that made them do it. They’re wise and honorable, and will no doubt give you reasons for it. I haven’t come to steal your loyalty, friends. I’m no orator, as Brutus is. I’m only, as you know, a plain, blunt man who loved his friend, and the men who let me speak know this well. I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up. I just speak directly. I tell you what you already know. I show you sweet Caesar’s wounds—poor, speechless mouths!—and make them speak for me. But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me, then I’d stir you up, and install in each of Caesar’s wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny.</p>

<b>CASSIUS</b>
<p>Messala, today is my birthday—I was born on this very day. Give me your hand, Messala. You’ll be my witness that I’ve been forced, as Pompey was, to wager all of our freedoms on one battle. You know that I used to believe in Epicurus and his disregard for omens. I’ve changed my mind now and partly believe in omens. Traveling from Sardis, two mighty eagles fell on our front flag and perched there, eating from the hands of the soldiers who’d accompanied us to Philippi. This morning, they’ve flown away and in their place are ravens, crows, and kites, flying over our heads and looking down on us, as though we were sickly prey. Their shadows are like a deadly canopy, under which our army lies, ready to die.</p>
