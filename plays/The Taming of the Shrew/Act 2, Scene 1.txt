    o:
      - "Good sister, wrong me not nor wrong yourself,"
      - "To make a bondmaid and a slave of me."
      - "That I disdain. But for these other goods—"
      - "Unbind my hands, I’ll pull them off myself,"
      - "Yea, all my raiment to my petticoat,"
      - "Or what you will command me will I do,"
      - "So well I know my duty to my elders."
    m:
      - "Dear sister, it’s unfair to me—and unfair to yourself—to turn me into a slave. That I won’t stand for. But if you want my *things*—untie my hands and I’ll give them to you myself, everything, even down to my slip. Or anything else you order me to do. I know I should obey my elders."

  - sp: KATHERINE
    o:
      - "Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell"
      - "Whom thou lovest best. See thou dissemble not."
    m:
      - "What I want is for you to tell me which of your suitors you like best. And don’t lie."

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "Believe me, sister, of all the men alive"
      - "I never yet beheld that special face"
      - "Which I could fancy more than any other."
    m:
      - "I swear, dear sister, I have not yet encountered that special face I might prefer to any other."

  - sp: KATHERINE
    o:
      - "Minion, thou liest. Is ’t not Hortensio?"
    m:
      - "You lying brat. It’s Hortensio, isn’t it?"

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "If you affect him, sister, here I swear"
      - "I’ll plead for you myself, but you shall have him."
    m:

    o:
      - "Oh, then belike you fancy riches more."
      - "You will have Gremio to keep you fair."
    m:
      - "Oh, I see. You’re more interested in money. You’ll live in luxury with Gremio."

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "Is it for him you do envy me so?"
      - "Nay, then you jest, and now I well perceive"
      - "You have but jested with me all this while."
      - "I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands."
    m:
      - "Is it because of *him* that you envy me? You must be kidding! And now I see that you’ve been joking all the while. Please, Kate, untie my hands."

      - "Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?—"
      - "Bianca, stand aside.—Poor girl, she weeps!"
      - "*(to BIANCA)* Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her."
      - "*(to KATHERINE)* For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit!"
      - "Why dost thou wrong her that did ne’er wrong thee?"
      - "When did she cross thee with a bitter word?"
    m:
      - "What in the world is going on! *(to KATHERINE)* Young lady, where do you get the nerve!—*(to BIANCA)* Get behind me, Bianca.—Poor girl, she’s hysterical!—Go do some sewing. Don’t even talk to her. *(to KATHERINE)* You monstrous, good-for-nothing fiend! Why would you want to hurt your sister? She never did you any harm! When has she spoken even one cross word to you?"

  - sp: KATHERINE
    o:
      - "Her silence flouts me, and I’ll be revenged."

      - "I must dance barefoot on her wedding day"
      - "And, for your love to her, lead apes in hell."
      - "Talk not to me. I will go sit and weep"
      - "Till I can find occasion of revenge."
    m:
      - "You mean you don’t even want to hear my side? Of course! She’s your treasure. She must have a husband and I must dance barefoot on her wedding day. You like her best and so I’ll die an old maid. Don’t talk to me. I’ll just go cry myself sick and think of some way to get back at all of you."

  - os: "Exit"

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "And you, good sir. Pray, have you not a daughter"
      - "Called Katherina, fair and virtuous?"
    m:
      - "And to you, good sir. Tell me, don’t you have a virtuous and lovely daughter named Katherina?"

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "I have a daughter, sir, called Katherina."

    o:
      - "*(to PETRUCHIO)* You are too blunt. Go to it orderly."
    m:
      - "*(to PETRUCHIO)* You are too blunt. You’re supposed to work up to it."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "You wrong me, Signior Gremio. Give me leave.—"
      - "I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,"
      - "That hearing of her beauty and her wit,"
      - "Her affability and bashful modesty,"
      - "Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,"
      - "Am bold to show myself a forward guest"
      - "Within your house, to make mine eye the witness"
      - "Of that report which I so oft have heard."

      - "*(presenting HORTENSIO, disguised as LITIO)*"
      - "Cunning in music and the mathematics,"
      - "To instruct her fully in those sciences,"
      - "Whereof I know she is not ignorant."
      - "Accept of him, or else you do me wrong."
      - "His name is Litio, born in Mantua."
    m:
      - "Please, Signior Gremio. Allow me to continue.—I am a gentleman of Verona, sir, who, hearing of your daughter’s beauty and wit, her friendly disposition and bashful modesty, her uncommon virtues and her mild behavior, have taken the liberty of presenting myself as a guest at your house in the hope of seeing for myself if what I’ve heard is true. And, as the price of admission for being received by you, I here present you with a servant of mine. *(he presents* HORTENSIO*, disguised as* LITIO)*. He is expert in the fields of music and mathematics. I thought he might instruct her in those branches of knowledge—of which she is, I gather, no beginner. Be good enough to accept this gift—I’ll be offended if you don’t. His name is Litio, and he comes from Mantua."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "You’re welcome, sir, and he for your good sake."
      - "But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,"
      - "She is not for your turn, the more my grief."
    m:
      - "You and he are both welcome, sir. As for my daughter Katherine, this much I know: she’s not for you—more’s the pity."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "I see you do not mean to part with her,"
      - "Or else you like not of my company."
    m:
      - "I see you don’t intend to part with her—or perhaps you don’t like my company."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "Mistake me not. I speak but as I find."
      - "Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?"
    m:
      - "Don’t misunderstand me, sir. I’m just stating the facts as I see them. Where are you from? What’s your name?"

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Petruchio is my name, Antonio’s son,"
      - "A man well known throughout all Italy."
    m:
      - "My name is Petruchio, son of Antonio, a man well known throughout Italy."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "I know him well. You are welcome for his sake."
    m:
      - "I know him well. You are welcome for his sake."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray"
      - "Let us that are poor petitioners speak too."
      - "*Bacare,* you are marvelous forward."
    m:
      - "With all due respect, Petruchio, give someone else a chance to speak. You’re *so* aggressive!"

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Oh, pardon me, Signior Gremio, I would fain be doing."
    m:
      - "Forgive me, Signior Gremio, but I’m anxious to get things moving."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "I doubt it not, sir, but you will curse your wooing.—"
      - "Neighbor, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar *(presenting LUCENTIO, disguised as CAMBIO)* that hath been long studying at Rheims, as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages as the other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio. Pray accept his service."
    m:
      - "No doubt, but you may be going about it the wrong way—Neighbor, this gift is very gracious, I’m sure. I myself, who am more indebted to you than anyone, have brought you this young scholar *(presenting LUCENTIO, disguised as CAMBIO)* who has long studied at Rheims. He is as expert in Greek, Latin, and other languages as that other man is in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio. Please accept his services."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. Welcome, good Cambio. *(to TRANIO as LUCENTIO)* But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger. May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?"
    m:
      - "Many thanks, Signior Gremio. Welcome, good Cambio. *(to TRANIO as LUCENTIO)* As for you, sir, you would appear to be a stranger. May I be so bold as to ask your reason for coming?"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,"
      - "That being a stranger in this city here"
      - "Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,"
      - "Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous."
      - "Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,"
      - "In the preferment of the eldest sister."
      - "This liberty is all that I request,"
      - "That, upon knowledge of my parentage,"
      - "I may have welcome ’mongst the rest that woo"
      - "And free access and favor as the rest."
      - "And toward the education of your daughters,"
      - "I here bestow a simple instrument"
      - "And this small packet of Greek and Latin books."
      - "BIONDELLO *brings the gifts forward*"
      - "If you accept them, then their worth is great."
    m:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Pardon me, sir, the boldness is all mine in seeking to court your fair and virtuous daughter, Bianca. I am indeed a stranger in this city. I’m aware of your firm decision regarding her older sister. I only ask that when you know who my parents are, I may be made as welcome as her other suitors and given the same freedom and favor. My contribution toward the education of your daughters is a lute and this small package of Greek and Latin books. *(BIONDELLO brings the gifts forward)* You would add to their value by accepting them."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "Lucentio is your name. Of whence, I pray?"
    m:
      - "Your name is Lucentio, you say. Of what city, may I ask?"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Of Pisa, sir, son to Vincentio."
    m:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Of Pisa, sir, son of Vincentio."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "A mighty man of Pisa. By report"
      - "I know him well. You are very welcome, sir."
      - "*(to HORTENSIO as LITIO)* Take you the lute,"
      - "*(to LUCENTIO as CAMBIO)* and you the set of books."
      - "You shall go see your pupils presently."
      - "Holla, within!"
    m:
      - "A man of great influence. I know him well by reputation. You are very welcome here, sir. *(to HORTENSIO as LITIO)* You take the lute *(to LUCENTIO as CAMBIO)*, and you, the set of books. I’ll send you to your pupils right away. You there in the house!"

  - os: "Enter a Servant"
    ms: "A servant enters."

  - o:
      - "  Sirrah, lead these gentlemen"
      - "To my daughters, and tell them both"
      - "These are their tutors. Bid them use them well."
    m:
      - "Boy, take these gentlemen to my daughters, and tell them both they are to be their teachers and to be courteous to them."

  - os: "Exit Servant with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO, BIONDELLO following"
    ms: "The servant exits with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO, followed by BIONDELLO."

  - o:
      - "We will go walk a little in the orchard,"
      - "And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,"
      - "And so I pray you all to think yourselves."
    m:
      - "Let’s take a little walk in the orchard before dinner. You are all most welcome here; please make yourselves at home."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,"
      - "And every day I cannot come to woo."
      - "You knew my father well, and in him me,"
      - "Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,"
      - "Which I have bettered rather than decreased."
      - "Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love,"
      - "What dowry shall I have with her to wife?"
    m:
      - "Signior Baptista, I’m actually in a bit of a hurry. I can’t make this wooing into a daily thing. You knew my father well; therefore, you know me, the sole heir to all his property and possessions, which I have added to rather than depleted. So, tell me, assuming I win your daughter’s love, what dowry would she bring to the marriage?"

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "After my death, the one half of my lands,"
      - "And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns."
    m:
      - "Twenty thousand crowns now, and half my lands after my death."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "And, for that dowry, I’ll assure her of"
      - "Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,"
      - "In all my lands and leases whatsoever."
      - "Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,"
      - "That covenants may be kept on either hand."
    m:
      - "Fair enough. And on my side, I’ll guarantee that if I die before she does, she shall inherit all my land and the rent from any property I own. Let’s have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "Ay, when the special thing is well obtained,"
      - "That is, her love, for that is all in all."
    m:
      - "Certainly, as soon as you’ve gotten the most important thing—her love. That counts for everything."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Why, that is nothing. For I tell you, father,"
      - "I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;"
      - "And where two raging fires meet together,"
      - "They do consume the thing that feeds their fury."
      - "Though little fire grows great with little wind,"
      - "Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all."
      - "So I to her and so she yields to me,"
      - "For I am rough and woo not like a babe."
    m:
      - "Oh, that’s nothing, believe me, sir. I’m as commanding as she is proud, and when two raging fires meet, they end up consuming the very thing that kindled them. Blow on a fire and all you do is fan the flames. But a great gust of wind will blow the fire out completely. I’m that great gust to her fire. I’m rough, and I don’t woo like a little boy."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed."
      - "But be thou armed for some unhappy words."
    m:
      - "Well, good luck! I hope you’re successful. But prepare yourself for some unpleasantness."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,"
      - "That shakes not, though they blow perpetually."
    m:
      - "I’ll be completely prepared. Mountains don’t tremble, however much the wind may blow!"

  - os: "Enter HORTENSIO as LITIO, with his head broke"
    ms: "Enter HORTENSIO as LITIO, with his head cut and bleeding"

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "How now, my friend, why dost thou look so pale?"
    m:
      - "Gracious! Why so pale, my friend?"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "*(as LITIO)* For fear, I promise you, if I look pale."
    m:
      - "*(as LITIO)* I would have to say from fear."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "What, will my daughter prove a good musician?"
    m:
      - "Will my daughter be a good musician, do you think?"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier."
      - "Iron may hold with her, but never lutes."
    m:
      - "I think she’ll be a better soldier. She may be good with firearms. Never lutes."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?"
    m:
      - "You don’t think you can teach her?"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Why, no, for she hath broke the lute to me."
      - "I did but tell her she mistook her frets,"
      - "And bowed her hand to teach her fingering,"
      - "When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,"
      - "“’Frets’ call you these?” quoth she. “I’ll fume with them!”"
      - "And with that word she struck me on the head,"
      - "And through the instrument my pate made way,"
      - "And there I stood amazèd for a while"
      - "As on a pillory, looking through the lute,"
      - "While she did call me “rascal fiddler”"
      - "And “twangling Jack”; with twenty such vile terms,"
      - "As had she studied to misuse me so."
    m:
      - "No, but she’s taught me a thing or two! All I said was that she was using the wrong frets and tried to adjust her fingering. And she jumps up and says, “Frets? I’ll give you frets!” With that, she clobbers me with the lute so that my head goes right through, and there I am, dazed, strings around my neck, looking through the sound hole like I was in the stocks, while she calls me “worthless fiddler,” “twanging twerp,” and twenty more hateful names, as though she’d prepared for me by composing a long list of insults to use on my behalf."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench."
      - "I love her ten times more than e’er I did."
      - "Oh, how I long to have some chat with her!"
    m:
      - "I like this girl! She has real character! Now I want her more than ever. I can’t wait to meet her!"

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "*(to HORTENSIO as LITIO)*"
      - "Well, go with me and be not so discomfited."
      - "Proceed in practice with my younger daughter."
      - "She’s apt to learn and thankful for good turns."
      - "Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,"
      - "Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?"
    m:
      - "*(to HORTENSIO, disguised as LITIO)* All right, come with me. Don’t be discouraged. Continue your lessons with my younger daughter. She’s quick to learn and responsive. Signior Petruchio, will you come with us, or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?"

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "I pray you do."
    m:
      - "Please do."

  - os: "Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO"
    ms: "Everyone but PETRUCHIO exits."

  - o:
      - "    I’ll attend her here"
      - "And woo her with some spirit when she comes."
      - "Say that she rail; why then I’ll tell her plain"
      - "She sings as sweetly as a nightingale."
      - "Say that she frown; I’ll say she looks as clear"
      - "As morning roses newly washed with dew."
      - "Say she be mute and will not speak a word;"
      - "Then I’ll commend her volubility,"
      - "And say she uttereth piercing eloquence."
      - "If she do bid me pack, I’ll give her thanks,"
      - "As though she bid me stay by her a week."
      - "If she deny to wed, I’ll crave the day"
      - "When I shall ask the banns and when be marrièd."
      - "But here she comes—and now, Petruchio, speak."
    m:
      - "I’ll wait for her here and when she comes I’ll take a novel approach with her. If she rants, I’ll tell her that she sings as sweetly as a nightingale. If she glares, I’ll say her brow is as clear as roses newly washed with morning dew. If she is silent and won’t speak at all, I’ll praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence. If she orders me to go, I’ll thank her warmly as if she’d just offered to put me up for a week. If she refuses my proposal, I’ll tell her how much I’m looking forward to the announcement and the wedding. But here she comes. Here goes!"

  - os: "Enter KATHERINE"
    ms: "KATHERINE enters."

  - o:
      - "Good morrow, Kate—for that’s your name, I hear."
    m:
      - "Good morning, Kate, for I hear that’s what you’re called."

  - sp: KATHERINE
    o:
      - "Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing."
      - "They call me Katherine that do talk of me."
    m:
      - "Is that what you’ve heard? Then you’d better get your ears checked. I am called Katherine by those who have any business using my name."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "You lie, in faith, for you are called plain Kate,"
      - "And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst,"
      - "But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,"
      - "Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate—"
      - "For dainties are all Kates—and therefore, Kate,"
      - "Take this of me, Kate of my consolation:"
      - "Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,"

You haven’t got it in you to frown or look displeased or bite your lip as angry women do. You don’t take pleasure in bitter conversation. No, you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation, quiet and pleasant. Why does the world report that Kate is lame? The world’s a liar. Kate is as straight and slender as a hazel-twig, her hair as brown as hazelnut shells, and she herself sweeter than the kernels. Take a few steps—I want to see you walk. You don’t limp at all!"

I swear by this light, which shows me your beauty—the beauty that makes me love you—that you must be married to no man but me.

    m:
      - "*(speaking as LUCENTIO)* That “solely” is very much to the point. *(to BAPTISTA)* Sir, hear me out: I am my father’s only son and, as such, his *sole* heir. If you give me your daughter’s hand in marriage, she will end up with three or four houses in Pisa as good as any one that Gremio has in Padua—not to mention the two thousand ducats a year that my land earns me. All of which I’ll leave her in my will. Did I see you flinch, Signior Gremio?"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(as LUCENTIO)* Gremio, ’tis known my father hath no less"
      - "Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,"

    m:
      - "*(speaking as LUCENTIO)* Please, Gremio! Everyone knows that my father has no less than three, huge merchant ships and fourteen galleys—two large and twelve small. These also I promise to Bianca—and whatever your next offer is, I’ll double it."

    o:

As you know, next Sunday my daughter Katherina is to be married. *(to TRANIO as LUCENTIO)* Therefore, the Sunday after, Bianca shall be married to you—if you obtain that guarantee. If not, she’ll be married to Signior Gremio. And so I thank you both and bid you goodbye."

    m:

      - "Sneaky, dried-up old coot! We’ll see who gets the upper hand! I’ve already bluffed pretty well—and without even a face card. I have a mind to help my master. Clearly, the fake Lucentio will have to produce a father—call him “fake Vincentio”—and it will be a miracle. Usually fathers produce children, not the other way around. But in this case of wooing, a child shall father his own father—if my wits don’t fail me."
