<p>Well thought upon. I have it here about me.</p>
<p><em>He gives a paper</em></p>
<p>When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.</p>
<p>But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,</p>
<p>Withal obdurate; do not hear him plead,</p>
<p>For Clarence is well-spoken and perhaps</p>
<p>May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.</p>

<p>Good thinking. I have it on me here. <em>(he hands over the warrant)</em> When you’re done, go to Crosby Place. But, sirs, do the job fast. And stick to your mission. Don’t let him plead for his life, because Clarence is a good talker and may make you pity him if you let him get started.</p>
