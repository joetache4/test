<p>Yes, a dozen, and as many to th’ vantage as would store the world they played for.</p>
<p>But I do think it is their husbands’ faults</p>
<p>If wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties</p>
<p>And pour our treasures into foreign laps,</p>
<p>Or else break out in peevish jealousies,</p>
<p>Throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,</p>
<p>Or scant our former having in despite.</p>
<p>Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,</p>
<p>Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know</p>
<p>Their wives have sense like them. They see and smell</p>
<p>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</p>
<p>As husbands have. What is it that they do</p>
<p>When they change us for others? Is it sport?</p>
<p>I think it is. And doth affection breed it?</p>
<p>I think it doth. Is ’t frailty that thus errs?</p>
<p>It is so too. And have not we affections,</p>
<p>Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?</p>
<p>Then let them use us well, else let them know,</p>
<p>The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>EMILIA</b>
<p>Yes, a dozen of them—as many as there are women in the world, in fact. But I do think it’s the husband’s fault if we wives cheat on them. For instance, our husbands may stop sleeping with us, and give it out to other women instead. Or they may get insanely jealous, and keep us from going anywhere. Or let’s say they hit us, or cut back on the money they give us out of spite. We have feelings. We may be able to forgive them, but we want to get back at them too. Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too. They see, smell, and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands. Why do they replace us with other women? Do they do it for fun? I think they do. Is it out of lust? I think so. Is it a weakness? It is. And don’t we have passions, and a taste for fun, and weaknesses, just like men? Then tell them to treat us well. Or let them figure out that the bad things we do are just what we learned from them.</p>
