<p>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.</p>
<p>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</p>
<p>The evil that men do lives after them;</p>
<p>The good is oft interrèd with their bones.</p>
<p>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</p>
<p>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.</p>
<p>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</p>

<p>But Brutus says he was ambitious,</p>
<p>And Brutus is an honorable man.</p>
<p>He hath brought many captives home to Rome</p>
<p>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.</p>
<p>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</p>
<p>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept.</p>
<p>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.</p>
<p>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,</p>
<p>And Brutus is an honorable man.</p>
<p>You all did see that on the Lupercal</p>
<p>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</p>
<p>Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?</p>
<p>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,</p>
<p>And, sure, he is an honorable man.</p>
<p>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</p>
<p>But here I am to speak what I do know.</p>
<p>You all did love him once, not without cause.</p>
<p>What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?</p>
<p>O judgment! Thou art fled to brutish beasts,</p>
<p>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me.</p>

<b>ANTONY</b>
<p>Friends, Romans, countrymen, give me your attention. I have come here to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do is remembered after their deaths, but the good is often buried with them. It might as well be the same with Caesar. The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious. If that’s true, it’s a serious fault, and Caesar has paid seriously for it. With the permission of Brutus and the others—for Brutus is an honorable man; they are all honorable men—I have come here to speak at Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, he was faithful and just to me. But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. He brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city. Is this the work of an ambitious man? When the poor cried, Caesar cried too. Ambition shouldn’t be so soft. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. You all saw that on the Lupercal feast day I offered him a king’s crown three times, and he refused it three times. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious. And, no question, Brutus is an honorable man. I am not here to disprove what Brutus has said, but to say what <em>I</em> know. You all loved him once, and not without reason. Then what reason holds you back from mourning him now? Men have become brutish beasts and lost their reason! Bear with me. My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, and I must pause until it returns to me. <em>(he weeps)</em></p>

<p>If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.</p>
<p>You all do know this mantle. I remember</p>
<p>The first time ever Caesar put it on.</p>
<p>’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent,</p>
<p>That day he overcame the Nervii.</p>
<p>Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through.</p>
<p>See what a rent the envious Casca made.</p>
<p>Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed.</p>
<p>And as he plucked his cursèd steel away,</p>
<p>Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,</p>
<p>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</p>
<p>If Brutus so unkindly knocked, or no.</p>
<p>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.</p>
<p>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</p>
<p>This was the most unkindest cut of all.</p>
<p>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</p>
<p>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,</p>
<p>Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart,</p>
<p>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</p>
<p>Even at the base of Pompey’s statue,</p>
<p>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</p>
<p>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</p>
<p>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</p>
<p>Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.</p>
<p>Oh, now you weep, and, I perceive, you feel</p>
<p>The dint of pity. These are gracious drops.</p>
<p>Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold</p>
<p>Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here,</p>
<p>Here is himself, marred, as you see, with traitors.</p>

<p>If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all know this cloak. I remember the first time Caesar ever put it on. It was a summer’s evening; he was in his tent. It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors. Look, here’s where Cassius’ dagger pierced it. See the wound that Casca made. Through this hole beloved Brutus stabbed. And when he pulled out his cursed dagger, see how Caesar’s blood came with it, as if rushing out a door to see if it was really Brutus who was knocking so rudely. For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. The gods know how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkind cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, he understood his beloved Brutus’ ingratitude; it was stronger than the violence of traitors, and it defeated him, bursting his mighty heart. And at the base of Pompey’s statue, with his cloak covering his face, which was dripping with blood the whole time, great Caesar fell. Oh, what a fall it was, my countrymen! Then you and I and all of us fell down, while bloody treason triumphed. Oh, now you weep, and I sense that you feel pity. These are gracious tears. But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar’s wounded cloak, how will you feel, kind men, now? Look at this, here is the man—scarred, as you can see, by traitors. <em>(he lifts up CAESAR’s cloak)</em></p>

<p>Good friends, sweet friends! Let me not stir you up</p>
<p>To such a sudden flood of mutiny.</p>
<p>They that have done this deed are honorable.</p>
<p>What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,</p>
<p>That made them do it. They are wise and honorable,</p>
<p>And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.</p>
<p>I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.</p>

<p>That love my friend. And that they know full well</p>
<p>That gave me public leave to speak of him.</p>
<p>For I have neither wit nor words nor worth,</p>
<p>Action nor utterance nor the power of speech,</p>
<p>To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on.</p>
<p>I tell you that which you yourselves do know,</p>
<p>Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,</p>
<p>And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,</p>
<p>And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony</p>
<p>Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue</p>
<p>In every wound of Caesar that should move</p>
<p>The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.</p>

<p>Good friends, sweet friends, don’t let me stir you up to such a sudden mutiny. Those who have done this deed are honorable. I don’t know what private grudges they had that made them do it. They’re wise and honorable, and will no doubt give you reasons for it. I haven’t come to steal your loyalty, friends. I’m no orator, as Brutus is. I’m only, as you know, a plain, blunt man who loved his friend, and the men who let me speak know this well. I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up. I just speak directly. I tell you what you already know. I show you sweet Caesar’s wounds—poor, speechless mouths!—and make them speak for me. But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me, then I’d stir you up, and install in each of Caesar’s wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny.</p>
