<p>We’re poor. The nobles are rich. The nobles have so much to eat that they overindulge and get sick, but if they’d only give us their excess food, we wouldn’t be starving any longer. We’d think they were compassionate if they helped us, but they think we’re too expensive to feed and don’t deserve to eat. They look at our thin, starving bodies and see them as a measure of their own abundance. Our suffering shows them how much they have. Let’s seek revenge with our pitchforks before we become as thin as rakes. The gods know I only say this because I’m hungry for bread, not thirsty for revenge.</p>

<p>Whoever speaks kindly to you flatters you undeservingly. What do you want, you dogs, who are satisfied by neither peace nor war? The one frightens you, and the other makes you self-righteous. Whoever trusts you sees you as lions, though he should see you as hares, and sees you as foxes, though he should see you as geese. You’re as unstable as a burning coal on ice or a hailstone in the sun. Your nature is to honor those who should be punished for their crimes and then to curse the justice that punishes him. He who deserves greatness deserves your scorn. Your instincts are perverted: you most desire the things that will make you sicker. He who depends on your approval swims with fins of lead and cuts down oaks with blades of grass. You should be hanged! Trust you? You change your mind every minute. You call the man you hated a moment ago “noble,” and you call the one you used to praise “vile.” Why do you cry against the noble Senate all around the city? Second only to the gods, they take care of you, you who would otherwise eat each other. What do the people want?</p>

<p>no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if</p>
<p>renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek</p>
<p>danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel</p>
<p>war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows</p>
<p>bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not</p>
<p>more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child</p>

<p>Please, my daughter-in-law, sing or express yourself more cheerfully. If my son were my husband, I would be happier with him away winning honors than lovingly embracing me in bed. Before he was full grown, when he was still my only child, when he was boyishly handsome and attracting much attention, when even if the king begged me I shouldn’t have let him out of my sight for an hour, I considered how honored he would become, and that unless he were inspired to make a name for himself, he would be no better than a picture hanging on the wall, so I happily let him face danger, because that’s how he was likely to find fame. I sent him to a cruel war from which he returned crowned with garlands of oak. I tell you, daughter-in-law, I jumped for joy more to see that he had proven himself as a man than I did when I first heard he was a boy child.</p>

You look like men, but you have the souls of geese. Why did you run from slaves that even apes could beat? Pluto, god of the dead and the underworld! You ran away and didn’t fight back; your backs are red with blood and your faces pale with fear! Pull yourselves together and charge again, or, by the fires of heaven, I’ll stop fighting the Volsces and attack you instead. Listen, if you can hold steady, we’ll beat them and take their wives.

<p>I’m known as a moody aristocrat, and one that loves a cup of hot wine not diluted by even a drop of water from the Tiber River. I’m said to be somewhat flawed as a judge because I’m hastily swayed by the first argument I hear. I’m quick to anger at the slightest disturbance. I stay up late at night and don’t rise early in the morning. I say whatever I think and express my anger when I speak. Meeting two statesmen such as yourselves—I cannot call you lawmakers—if I don’t like the drink you give me, I make a crooked face at it. I don’t think you deserve the respectful titles of your profession, when I find most of what you say to be asinine. And though I can tolerate those that say you are respectable, serious men, the ones who say you are honest are deadly liars. If you see these same qualities in me, doesn’t it make sense that I’m known for my bad qualities? What harm can your misperceptions do to my character, if I already have a bad reputation?</p>

<b>COMINIUS</b>
<p>I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus</p>
<p>Should not be utter’d feebly. It is held</p>
<p>That valour is the chiefest virtue, and</p>
<p>Most dignifies the haver: if it be,</p>
<p>The man I speak of cannot in the world</p>
<p>Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,</p>
<p>When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought</p>
<p>Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,</p>
<p>Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,</p>
<p>When with his Amazonian chin he drove</p>
<p>The bristled lips before him: be bestrid</p>
<p>An o’er-press’d Roman and i’ the consul’s view</p>
<p>Slew three opposers: Tarquin’s self he met,</p>
<p>And struck him on his knee: in that day’s feats,</p>
<p>When he might act the woman in the scene,</p>
<p>He proved best man i’ the field, and for his meed</p>
<p>Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age</p>
<p>Man-enter’d thus, he waxed like a sea,</p>
<p>And in the brunt of seventeen battles since</p>
<p>He lurch’d all swords of the garland. For this last,</p>
<p>Before and in Corioli, let me say,</p>
<p>I cannot speak him home: he stopp’d the fliers;</p>
<p>And by his rare example made the coward</p>
<p>Turn terror into sport: as weeds before</p>
<p>A vessel under sail, so men obey’d</p>
<p>And fell below his stem: his sword, death’s stamp,</p>
<p>Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot</p>
<p>He was a thing of blood, whose every motion</p>
<p>Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter’d</p>
<p>The mortal gate of the city, which he painted</p>
<p>With shunless destiny; aidless came off,</p>
<p>And with a sudden reinforcement struck</p>
<p>Corioli like a planet: now all’s his:</p>
<p>When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce</p>
<p>His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit</p>
<p>Re-quicken’d what in flesh was fatigate,</p>
<p>And to the battle came he; where he did</p>
<p>Run reeking o’er the lives of men, as if ’Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call’d</p>
<p>Both field and city ours, he never stood</p>
<p>To ease his breast with panting.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>COMINIUS</b>
<p>I won’t say much. The deeds of Coriolanus shouldn’t be spoken of lightly. It’s well known that courage is the highest virtue and brings the highest dignity to whoever has it. And if that’s true, there’s no one in the world who is more dignified than the man I speak of. At age sixteen, when Tarquin attacked Rome, his fighting exceeded everyone else’s. Our former leader, whom I reference with all praise, saw him fight victoriously against adults when he was still young and had a beardless chin. He protected the overwhelmed Romans and as the consul watched, he defeated three enemies. He fought Tarquin himself and brought him to his knees.  In that day of fighting, when he was young enough to play a woman on stage, he proved to be the best man in the field, and he was rewarded with a garland of oak. He entered into manhood, though he was still a boy, with the force of a rising tide. He has led the attack in seventeen battles since then, and he has won the garland over his fellow soldiers every time. As for this last battle, outside of and within Corioles, I have no words to describe what he did. He stopped the Roman deserters and by his rare example made these cowards overcome their fear and become warriors. The men obeyed and fell beneath his prow like waves beneath a sailboat. Wherever he swung his sword, he marked the sign of death. From head to toe he was covered in blood, and his every motion was followed by dying cries. He entered the deadly gate of the city alone, and he painted it with the blood of their inevitable destiny. Without help, he retreated, but with a sudden burst of energy he attacked Corioles with the force of a planet. Then the city was all his. After a while, as the noise of war began to wear him down, his spirit reinvigorated his tired body, and he came back to the battle and ran furiously at the enemy, as if it were an endless slaughter. He never stopped to catch his breath until both the field and city were ours.</p>

<p>We are the greater poll, and in true fear</p>
<p>They gave us our demands.” Thus we debase</p>

<p>I’ll give my reasons, which are worthier than their wishes. They know they didn’t earn the corn, as they certainly never did any service for it. Even when they were drafted to fight the war when the center of the state was threatened, they wouldn’t leave the city gates. This kind of service doesn’t deserve free corn. When they were in the war, their mutinies and revolts, which were the only times they showed any courage, didn’t speak well for them. Their frequent accusation that the Senate was hoarding corn had no basis, so it could never be the reason for our generous gift. Well, what then? How will this many-headed monster repay the Senate’s kindness? Let their actions express what their words should be: “We asked for it, we are the majority of the population, and out of fear they gave in to our demands.” In doing this we degrade the nature of our position and make the rabble think that our sympathy is fear. In time this will break open the locks of the Senate, and the scavengers will devour us.</p>

<b>CORIOLANUS</b>
<p>No, there’s more! I swear there’s both divine and human confirmation of what I have to say. A divided government—in which one part rightfully despises the other and the other part makes insulting accusations without any reason, and in which people of class, title, and wisdom are reduced to deciding things just by voting yes or no—will be unable to focus on important matters and so instead will deal only with trivial concerns. When governing becomes so difficult, it makes sense that nothing will get done well. So I beg you, you who won’t be afraid to take action because you care more about preserving our government than you fear the consequences of doing so, you who prefer a noble life over a long one and are willing to use a dangerous medicine to help someone who would otherwise surely die, you must immediately remove the representatives of the common people. Don’t let the tribunes use their poisonous flattery. When they dishonor you, it’s an impediment to justice. It robs the state of your much-needed integrity and leaves the state without the power to do the good it would because evil forces are controlling it.</p>

<p>My name is Caius Martius. I’ve done great hurt and mischief to you particularly and to all the Volsces, proof of which is my surname: Coriolanus. I worked very hard, faced extreme dangers, and shed drops of blood for my ungrateful country. My only compensation is that name. It’s a reminder and signifier of the hatred you should feel for me. That name is all that is left. With envious cruelty, the Roman people, enabled by the cowardly nobles, have turned on me and taken away all that I had. These slaves have voted me out of Rome.  These extreme circumstances are what have brought me to your home. Make no mistake: I have no wish to save my life. If I feared death, I would have avoided you more than any other man in the world. Instead I stand here before you with only my hatred and desire for revenge against my banishers. If you’re inclined to seek vengeance of your own and end the shame that’s seen throughout your country, see now how you can use my suffering to serve your purpose. Helping me get revenge will be beneficial to you. I’ll fight my own cursed country with the fury of all the hell beings. But if you choose not to do this, if you’re too tired to take this chance, then since I am also too tired to keep living, I present my throat to you and your longstanding hatred. You’d be a fool not to cut it.  I’ve always pursued you with hatred, I’ve spilled barrels of your country’s blood, so to let me live would only bring you shame unless I can work on your behalf.</p>

<p>Should from yond cloud speak divine things,</p>
<p>And say “’Tis true,” I’ld not believe them more</p>

<p>Mine arms about that body, where against</p>
<p>My grained ash an hundred times hath broke</p>
<p>And scarr’d the moon with splinters: here I clip</p>
<p>The anvil of my sword, and do contest</p>
<p>As hotly and as nobly with thy love</p>
<p>As ever in ambitious strength I did</p>
<p>Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,</p>
<p>I loved the maid I married; never man</p>
<p>Sigh’d truer breath; but that I see thee here,</p>
<p>Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart</p>
<p>Than when I first my wedded mistress saw</p>
<p>Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,</p>
<p>We have a power on foot; and I had purpose</p>
<p>Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,</p>
<p>Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out</p>
<p>Twelve several times, and I have nightly since</p>
<p>Dreamt of encounters ’twixt thyself and me;</p>
<p>We have been down together in my sleep,</p>
<p>Unbuckling helms, fisting each other’s throat,</p>
<p>And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Martius,</p>
<p>Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that</p>
<p>Thou art thence banish’d, we would muster all</p>
<p>From twelve to seventy, and pouring war</p>
<p>Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,</p>
<p>Like a bold flood o’er-bear. O, come, go in,</p>
<p>And take our friendly senators by the hands;</p>
<p>Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,</p>
<p>Who am prepared against your territories,</p>
<p>Though not for Rome itself.</p>

<p>Oh, Martius, Martius! Each word that you’ve spoken has weeded from my heart a root of longstanding hatred. If from that far cloud Jupiter should speak divine things and say, “It’s true,” I would believe him no less than I believe you, noble Martius. Let me wrap my arms around this body of yours, which my wooden lance has beaten and been splintered against a hundred times. You are the anvil that my sword used to strike, and now I embrace you. Now I strive to gain your comradeship with as much ferocity and honor as I used to fight you. You should know: I loved the woman I married, that’s the truth, but seeing you here, you noble thing, makes my heart  more enraptured than when I first saw my new bride walk across my threshold. You are the god of war! I tell you, our army is ready to deploy, and now I have reason again to force your shield off of your strong arm, or lose my own arm instead. You’ve defeated me twelve different times, and every night since I have dreamed of encounters between us. We’d fight down on the ground, taking off our helmets, forcing our fists into each other’s throats. Then I wake up, half dead, and it was all a dream. Worthy Martius, even if we had no reason to attack Rome other than the fact that you’ve been banished, we would assemble every man from ages twelve to seventy and flood ungrateful Rome with our fury. Come inside now and shake hands with our senators. They are just now saying goodbye to me, as I was about to attack Roman territories, though not Rome itself.</p>

<p>As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it</p>
<p>By sovereignty of nature. First he was</p>
<p>A noble servant to them; but he could not</p>
<p>Carry his honours even: whether ’twas pride,</p>
<p>Which out of daily fortune ever taints</p>
<p>The happy man; whether defect of judgment,</p>
<p>To fail in the disposing of those chances</p>
<p>Which he was lord of; or whether nature,</p>
<p>Not to be other than one thing, not moving</p>
<p>From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace</p>
<p>Even with the same austerity and garb</p>
<p>As he controll’d the war; but one of these—</p>
<p>As he hath spices of them all, not all,</p>
<p>For I dare so far free him—made him fear’d,</p>
<p>So hated, and so banish’d: but he has a merit,</p>

<p>Lie in the interpretation of the time:</p>
<p>And power, unto itself most commendable,</p>
<p>Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair</p>
<p>To extol what it hath done.</p>
<p>One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;</p>
<p>Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.</p>
<p>Come, let’s away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,</p>
<p>Thou art poor’st of all; then shortly art thou mine.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>AUFIDIUS</b>
<p>Wherever he goes, they yield to him before he begins to attack. The young nobles of Rome, the senators, and the patricians all support him. The tribunes aren’t soldiers, and their people will be as quick to reverse their judgment of him as they were to throw him out. I think he’ll be to Rome like the fish hawk is to the fish: the fish will submit by its nature. At first he was a noble servant to them, but he couldn’t handle the honors bestowed upon him. Whether it was pride—winning in battle all the time always makes men prideful—or whether it was a failure of judgment that he was unable to take advantage of the opportunities he had, or whether it was just his nature not to evolve from wearing the helmet of a soldier to the sitting on the cushion of a senator, to command peace in the same austere way that he commanded the wars. One of these—he has some of each but none in their entirety—caused him to be feared and so despised that he was banished. But all his merits should stop us from listing his faults. Time will tell whether one is judged as virtuous. Powerful men think their power is praiseworthy, but nothing destroys power faster than publicly proclaiming it. One fire burns out another, one nail hammers out another nail, and righteousness and strength crumble under their own weight. Come, let’s go. Caius, when Rome is yours, you will be the poorest of them all. And then you’ll be mine.</p>

Your hatred will kill us poor people. You deny our prayers to the gods, which is the only comfort we have, and if we can’t pray—and pray for our country—where will we go if you succeed, where will we go? Alas, either we must lose the country, our dear mother, or else we must lose you, our comfort in the country. We will inevitably face tragedy, but we do have a wish for one side to win. Either you must, as a traitor, be led with handcuffs thorough our streets, or else triumphantly march on your ruined country and wear the medal for having bravely shed your wife and children’s blood. For myself, son, I don’t intend to rely on fortune until these wars end. If I can’t persuade you to reach a noble compromise with both sides rather than seek total destruction, when you march to assault your country you’ll be treading—and believe me about this—on your mother’s womb, which brought you into this world.</p>

<p>Nay, go not from us thus.</p>
<p>If it were so that our request did tend</p>
<p>To save the Romans, thereby to destroy</p>
<p>The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,</p>
<p>As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit</p>
<p>Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces</p>
<p>May say “This mercy we have show’d;” the Romans,</p>
<p>“This we received;” and each in either side</p>
<p>Give the all-hail to thee and cry “Be blest</p>
<p>For making up this peace!” Thou know’st, great son,</p>
<p>The end of war’s uncertain, but this certain,</p>
<p>That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit</p>
<p>Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,</p>
<p>Whose repetition will be dogg’d with curses;</p>
<p>Whose chronicle thus writ: “The man was noble,</p>
<p>But with his last attempt he wiped it out;</p>
<p>Destroy’d his country, and his name remains</p>
<p>To the ensuing age abhorr’d.” Speak to me, son:</p>
<p>Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,</p>
<p>To imitate the graces of the gods;</p>
<p>To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o’ the air,</p>
<p>And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt</p>
<p>That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?</p>
<p>Think’st thou it honourable for a noble man</p>
<p>Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:</p>
<p>He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:</p>
<p>Perhaps thy childishness will move him more</p>
<p>Than can our reasons. There’s no man in the world</p>
<p>More bound to ’s mother; yet here he lets me prate</p>
<p>Like one i’ the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life</p>
<p>Show’d thy dear mother any courtesy,</p>
<p>When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,</p>
<p>Has cluck’d thee to the wars and safely home,</p>

<p>Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,</p>
<p>That thou restrain’st from me the duty which</p>
<p>To a mother’s part belongs. He turns away:</p>
<p>Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.</p>
<p>To his surname Coriolanus ’longs more pride</p>
<p>Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;</p>
<p>This is the last: so we will home to Rome,</p>
<p>And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold ’s:</p>
<p>This boy, that cannot tell what he would have</p>
<p>But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,</p>
<p>Does reason our petition with more strength</p>
<p>Than thou hast to deny ’t. Come, let us go:</p>
<p>This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;</p>
<p>His wife is in Corioli and his child</p>
<p>Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:</p>

<b>VOLUMNIA</b>
<p>No, don’t leave us now. If it were the case that our request was to save the Romans and thereby destroy the Volsces, whom you serve, you might condemn us for poisoning your honor. But no, our appeal is for you to reconcile with them so that the Volsces may say, “We have shown mercy,” and the Romans may say, “We received mercy,” and both sides will salute you and cry, “May you be blessed for making this peace!” You know, great son, that the outcome of war is uncertain. But it’s certain that if you conquer Rome, the benefit you’ll reap in so doing is a name whose repetition will be plagued with curses. You’ll be remembered with these words: “The man was noble, but with his last attack he gave up his nobility, destroyed his country, and his name remains forever hated.” Speak to me, son. You’ve aspired to great honor, to behave like a god, to tear apart the sky with thunder and yet throw your lightning bolt so that it would only split an oak. Why don’t you speak? Do you think it’s honorable for a noble man to always remember how he has been wronged? Daughter, speak—he doesn’t like your weeping. Speak, boy—perhaps your childishness will move him more than our reasons can. There’s no man in the world more tied to his mother, and yet here he lets me prattle on like a common criminal. Never in your life have you done your dear mother any favors, while she, poor woman, who didn’t want to have another child, has cared for you while you were at war and safely home, heaped with honors. If you think my request is unfair, then turn me down. But if it’s not, then you’re a liar and the gods will punish you for failing to give me what you owe me as a son. He turns away. Down, ladies. Let’s shame him by getting on our knees. His surname, Coriolanus, has more pride than pity for our prayers. Down! This is the end. <em>(The women and young Martius kneel)</em> We’ll go home to Rome and die among our neighbors. Wait, look. This boy, who doesn’t know what’s going to happen to him but kneels and holds up his hands for fellowship, lends more strength to our petition than you have strength to deny. Come, let’s go. This fellow has a Volscian mother, his wife is in Corioles, and his child looks just like him by chance. Send us away. I’ll be silent until our city is on fire, and then I’ll speak a little.</p>
