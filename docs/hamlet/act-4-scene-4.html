<p>To tell the truth, we’re fighting to win a little patch of ground that’s not worth anything. I myself wouldn’t pay five ducats for it, if someone offered it to me to farm. And it won’t provide any more profits than that to either the Norwegian or the Pole.</p>

<p>How all occasions do inform against me,</p>
<p>And spur my dull revenge! What is a man</p>
<p>If his chief good and market of his time</p>
<p>Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.</p>
<p>Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,</p>
<p>Looking before and after, gave us not</p>
<p>That capability and godlike reason</p>
<p>To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be</p>
<p>Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple</p>
<p>Of thinking too precisely on th’ event—</p>
<p>A thought which, quartered, hath but one part wisdom</p>
<p>And ever three parts coward—I do not know</p>
<p>Why yet I live to say “This thing’s to do,”</p>
<p>Sith I have cause and will and strength and means</p>
<p>To do ’t. Examples gross as earth exhort me.</p>
<p>Witness this army of such mass and charge</p>
<p>Led by a delicate and tender prince,</p>
<p>Whose spirit with divine ambition puffed</p>
<p>Makes mouths at the invisible event,</p>
<p>Exposing what is mortal and unsure</p>
<p>To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,</p>
<p>Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great</p>
<p>Is not to stir without great argument,</p>
<p>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw</p>
<p>When honor’s at the stake. How stand I then,</p>
<p>That have a father killed, a mother stained,</p>
<p>Excitements of my reason and my blood,</p>
<p>And let all sleep—while, to my shame, I see</p>
<p>The imminent death of twenty thousand men,</p>
<p>That for a fantasy and trick of fame</p>
<p>Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot</p>
<p>Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,</p>
<p>Which is not tomb enough and continent</p>
<p>To hide the slain? Oh, from this time forth,</p>
<p>My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<p>My God! Everything I see shows me how wrong I am and tells me to hurry up and get on with my revenge. What is a human being if he just eats and sleeps? Nothing more than a beast. God didn’t create us with such a huge power of thought and a divine capacity for reason in order for us not to use them. Now, whether it’s animal-like mindlessness, or the cowardly hesitation that comes from thinking too much (thinking thoughts that are one part wisdom, three parts cowardice), I don’t know why I’m still alive to say “I have to do this deed” rather than having done it already. I have the motivation, the willpower, the ability, and the means to do it. It’s as plain as the ground beneath my feet that I must do it. Look at this massive army led by a delicate and tender prince who’s so puffed up with divine ambition that he puts his fragile life at risk, exposing it to danger and death, for a reason as thin as an eggshell. To be truly great doesn’t mean you’d only fight for a good reason. It means you’d fight over nothing if your honor was at stake. So where does that leave me, whose father has been murdered and mother defiled, ignoring these mental and emotional provocations and letting well enough alone? Meanwhile, to my shame, I watch twenty thousand men go marching to their deaths for an illusion and a little bit of fame, fighting for a tiny piece of land not even big enough to bury them all. From now on, if my thoughts aren’t violent I’ll consider them worthless.</p>
