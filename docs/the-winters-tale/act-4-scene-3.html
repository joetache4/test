<p>When daffodils begin to peer,</p>
<p>With heigh! the doxy over the dale,</p>
<p>Why, then comes in the sweet o’ the year;</p>
<p>For the red blood reigns in the winter’s pale.</p>
<p>The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,</p>
<p>With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!</p>
<p>Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;</p>
<p>For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.</p>
<p>The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,</p>
<p>With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,</p>
<p>Are summer songs for me and my aunts,</p>
<p>While we lie tumbling in the hay.</p>
<p>I have served Prince Florizel and in my time</p>
<p>wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:</p>
<p>But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?</p>
<p>The pale moon shines by night:</p>
<p>And when I wander here and there,</p>
<p>I then do most go right.</p>
<p>If tinkers may have leave to live,</p>
<p>And bear the sow-skin budget,</p>
<p>Then my account I well may, give,</p>
<p>And in the stocks avouch it.</p>
<p>My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to</p>
<p>lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who</p>
<p>being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise</p>
<p>a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and</p>
<p>drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is</p>
<p>the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful</p>
<p>on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to</p>
<p>me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought</p>
<p>of it. A prize! a prize!</p>

<b>AUTOLYCUS</b>
<p>When daffodils begin to sprout, with the poor wench over the hills, why then it’s the sweetest part of the year as red blood reigns in flesh made pale by winter. The white sheet airing out on the hedge, and oh, the sweet birds singing, makes my thieving fingers itch, and a quart of beer is a drink for a king! The lark chants “tirra-lyra,” and the thrush and the jay sing, while my mistress and I tumble about in the hay. I have served Prince Florizel and worn three-piled velvet, but now I’m unemployed. But should I mourn for that, my dear? The pale moon shines at night, and in wandering here and there, I take the right course through life. If menders of metal pots have the right to live and bear the burden of their tool bag, then I can tell my own story and in the stocks. I deal in sheets, and when the thieving bird builds his nest, he takes up poorer linen. My father named me Autolycus. Like me he was born under Mercury, and like me he would steal those little things left unsecured. By gambling and pimping I bought this outfit, and my income is from little deceptions. Being a highwayman might get me hanged or beat, which are terrors to me, and as for the afterlife, I try not to think about it. Oh, look—a prize!</p>

<b>CLOWN</b>
<p>I can’t do it without something to add it up. Let’s see, what do I need to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pounds of sugar, five pounds of currants, rice. What does my sister need rice for? But my father has put her in charge of the feast, and she is doing a good job with it. She’s made twenty-four small bouquets for the shearers, who can all sing three-part songs, and very well. But they are mostly tenors and basses, and one is so saintly he sings psalms for dances. I have to get saffron to color the pear pies. Do I need mace and dates? No, that’s not on my list. Seven nutmegs, some ginger root—though I might be able to get that for free—and four pounds each of prunes and raisins.</p>
