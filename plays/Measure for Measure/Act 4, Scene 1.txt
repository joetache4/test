      - "Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit"
      - "Make thee the father of their idle dreams"
      - "And rack thee in their fancies."
    m:
      - "Oh, you people of high rank! Millions of treacherous eyes are fixed on you, accompanied by a mass of hostile rumors that follow everything you do. A thousand imaginations make you the source of their silly fantasies and torture you with their delusions."

  - os: "Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA"
    ms: "MARIANA and ISABELLA re-enter."

  - o:
      - "Welcome, how agreed?"
    m:

  - sp: ISABELLA
    o:
      - "She’ll take the enterprise upon her, father,"
      - "If you advise it."

      - "When you depart from him, but, soft and low,"
      - "“Remember now my brother.”"
    m:
      - "When you leave him, all you have to do is say softly, “Now remember my brother.”"

  - sp: MARIANA
    o:
      - "Fear me not."
    m:
      - "Don’t worry about me."

  - sp: DUKE VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all."
      - "He is your husband on a pre-contract:"
      - "To bring you thus together, ’tis no sin,"
      - "Sith that the justice of your title to him"
      - "Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:"
      - "Our corn’s to reap, for yet our tithe’s to sow."
    m:
      - "And, gentle daughter, don’t worry for yourself. He is your husband-to-be, so it’s no sin for you two to sleep together—your valid claim as his wife allows the deception. Come on, let’s go. We have to sow the seeds before we can reap the harvest."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
