<p>Is this a dagger which I see before me,</p>
<p>The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.</p>
<p>I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.</p>
<p>Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible</p>
<p>To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but</p>
<p>A dagger of the mind, a false creation,</p>
<p>Proceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain?</p>
<p>I see thee yet, in form as palpable</p>
<p>As this which now I draw.</p>
<p>Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going,</p>
<p>And such an instrument I was to use.</p>
<p>Mine eyes are made the fools o’ th’ other senses,</p>
<p>Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still,</p>
<p>And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,</p>
<p>Which was not so before. There’s no such thing.</p>
<p>It is the bloody business which informs</p>
<p>Thus to mine eyes. Now o’er the one half-world</p>
<p>Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse</p>
<p>The curtained sleep. Witchcraft celebrates</p>
<p>Pale Hecate’s offerings, and withered murder,</p>
<p>Alarumed by his sentinel, the wolf,</p>
<p>Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,</p>
<p>With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design</p>
<p>Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,</p>
<p>Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear</p>
<p>Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,</p>
<p>And take the present horror from the time,</p>
<p>Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives.</p>
<p>Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.</p>

<p>Is this a dagger I see in front of me, with its handle pointing toward my hand? <em>(to the dagger)</em> Come, let me hold you. <em>(he grabs at the air in front of him without touching anything)</em> I don’t have you but I can still see you. Fateful apparition, isn’t it possible to touch you as well as see you? Or are you nothing more than a dagger created by the mind, a hallucination from my fevered brain? I can still see you, and you look as real as this other dagger that I’m pulling out now.<em>(he draws a dagger)</em> You’re leading me toward the place I was going already, and I was planning to use a weapon just like you. My eyesight must either be the one sense that’s not working, or else it’s the only one that’s working right. I can still see you, and I see blood splotches on your blade and handle that weren’t there before. <em>(to himself)</em> There’s no dagger here. It’s the murder I’m about to do that’s making me think I see one. Now half the world is asleep and being deceived by evil nightmares. Witches are offering sacrifices to their goddess Hecate. Old man murder, having been roused by the howls of his wolf, walks silently to his destination, moving like Tarquin, as quiet as a ghost. <em>(speaking to the ground)</em> Hard ground, don’t listen to the direction of my steps. I don’t want you to echo back where I am and break the terrible stillness of this moment, a silence that is so appropriate for what I’m about to do. While I stay here talking, Duncan lives. The more I talk, the more my courage cools.</p>
