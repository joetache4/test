<p>My lord, when at their home</p>

<p>My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,</p>
<p>Stewed in his haste, half breathless, panting forth</p>
<p>From Goneril his mistress salutations,</p>
<p>Delivered letters spite of intermission,</p>
<p>Which presently they read, on whose contents</p>
<p>They summoned up their meiny, straight took horse,</p>

<p>Being the very fellow which of late</p>
<p>Displayed so saucily against your highness—</p>

<p>The shame which here it suffers.</p>

<b>KENT</b>
<p>My lord, when I arrived at their home I gave them your letter. Before I had a chance to get up from my respectful kneeling position, Goneril’s messenger arrived, stinky, sweaty, and out of breath. He interrupted me, spouted out greetings from her, and delivered her letter, which they opened immediately. After reading it, they gathered their entourage together and got on their horses to go. They glared at me and ordered me to follow them and wait for their answer. After we arrived here, I ran into that other messenger who made them give me the cold shoulder—the very same guy who was so rude to you, King. I admit it was foolish to draw my sword on him, but I had to act like a man. He woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams. That’s why your daughter and son-in-law are punishing me shamefully.</p>

<p>You need to learn what ants know well about winter—there’s no point in slaving away if there’s no hope for profit. Serving the king will get you nowhere. Everyone can see that, and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now. When you see a huge wheel rolling down a hill, you shouldn’t try to hold on to it or it’ll break your neck. But if you see a wheel going uphill, latch on for the ride. And when a wise man gives you better advice than I just did, give me my advice back again. I only want idiots following my advice, the advice of a fool.</p>

<p>And is only superficially loyal to you</p>

When our bodies are out of order, our minds can’t function properly. I’ll hold off, and subdue my impulsive temper, which makes me judge a sick man as if he were well. <em>(he notices KENT again)</em> A curse on my royal power! Why should he sit here like this? The fact that they punished him convinces me that Regan and the duke are avoiding me on purpose. I want my servant released. Go tell the duke and his wife I’ll speak to them right now, at once.
