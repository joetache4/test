<p>I would not be thy executioner.</p>

<p>Should be called tyrants, butchers, murderers.</p>

<b>PHOEBE</b>
<p>I don’t want to be your executioner: I’m trying to avoid you so that I won’t hurt you. You tell me my eyes are murderous—that’s a very pretty sentiment, and oh-so-probable, that my frail, soft eyes (which are so cowardly that they close their gates against dust) are tyrants, butchers, and murderers. I’m frowning at you with all my might right now. If my eyes can injure, let them kill you now. Go ahead. Faint, fall down—if you don’t, then you’re lying about my eyes being murderers. Come on, show me the wound that my eyes have caused. If you get scratched with a pin, it leaves a scar; even if you lean on a rush, it leaves an impression on your palm. But my eyes, which I’ve darted at you, haven’t even left a mark. Now I am sure that eyes can’t hurt a person.</p>

<p>As, by my faith, I see no more in you</p>

<p>Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?</p>
<p>Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?</p>

<p>Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?</p>

<p>Than she a woman. ’Tis such fools as you</p>
<p>That makes the world full of ill-favored children.</p>
<p>’Tis not her glass but you that flatters her,</p>
<p>And out of you she sees herself more proper</p>
<p>Than any of her lineaments can show her.</p>
<p>—But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees</p>
<p>And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love,</p>
<p>For I must tell you friendly in your ear,</p>

<b>ROSALIND</b>
<p><em>(coming forward, speaking as Ganymede)</em> And why, please tell me? Is your mother a goddess that you would insult a wretched man, and exult over the injury you’ve caused him, all at the same time? You’re not beautiful—really, you’re not so pretty that you could go to bed with the lights on—so why must you act so proud and pitiless? Wait a minute, what’s going on? Why are you looking at me like that? I don’t see anything in you but nature’s usual handiwork.—Oh, for God’s sake, I think she also wants me to fall in love with her. No, proud woman, don’t hope for that. Not even your black eyebrows, your silky black hair, your beady black eyeballs, or your yellowish-white complexion can make me worship you. You foolish shepherd: why are you following her, raining tears and puffing hot air like a foggy south wind? You are a thousand times better than she. It’s fools like you who, marrying badly, fill the world with ugly children. It’s not her mirror but you who insists she’s beautiful. The image of herself that she gets from you is better than her actual features. But mistress, know yourself. Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man. I’m telling you, as a friend, that you should sell while the market’s good—you’re not going to have many more buyers. Ask this man’s forgiveness, love him, and accept his offer. You’re already ugly, don’t make matters worse by being scornful, too. So take her, shepherd, and God bless you.</p>

<p>Think not I love him, though I ask for him.</p>
<p>’Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well—</p>
<p>But what care I for words? Yet words do well</p>
<p>When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.</p>
<p>It is a pretty youth—not very pretty—</p>
<p>But sure he’s proud—and yet his pride becomes him.</p>
<p>He’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him</p>
<p>Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue</p>
<p>Did make offense, his eye did heal it up.</p>
<p>He is not very tall—yet for his years he’s tall.</p>
<p>His leg is but so-so—and yet ’tis well.</p>
<p>There was a pretty redness in his lip,</p>
<p>A little riper and more lusty red</p>
<p>Than that mixed in his cheek: ’twas just the difference</p>
<p>Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.</p>
<p>There be some women, Silvius, had they marked him</p>
<p>In parcels as I did, would have gone near</p>
<p>To fall in love with him; but for my part</p>
<p>I love him not nor hate him not; and yet</p>
<p>I have more cause to hate him than to love him.</p>
<p>For what had he to do to chide at me?</p>
<p>He said mine eyes were black and my hair black</p>

<p>And thou shalt bear it. Wilt thou, Silvius?</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>PHOEBE</b>
<p>Don’t think I’m in love with him just because I’m asking about him. He’s an irritable boy, though he speaks well. But what do I care about words? And yet, words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to. He’s good-looking, but not too good-looking. He’s awfully proud, but his pride suits him. He’ll grow up to be a proper man. The best thing about him is his complexion: as fast as he offends me with words, his pretty face heals the wound. He’s not very tall, but he’s tall enough for his age. His legs aren’t great, but they’re alright. His lips were nice and red, a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks—one was pure red and the other more pink. There are women out there, Silvius, who would have nearly fallen in love with him after inspecting him as closely as I have. But I don’t love him or hate him—though I suppose I have more reason to hate him than love him. What right did he have to scold me like that? He said my eyes and my hair were black and, now that I think of it, he scorned me. I’m surprised I didn’t bite back. But no matter—I’ll get back at him soon enough. I’ll write him a taunting letter, and you can deliver it. Will you do that for me, Silvius?</p>
