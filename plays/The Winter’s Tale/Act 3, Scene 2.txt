      - "*(reads)* Hermione, queen of the worthy Leontes, king of Sicilia, you are accused and arraigned for high treason, for committing adultery with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring with Camillo to kill our sovereign king, your royal husband. Then, when the plot was accidentally discovered, you, Hermione, against the duty and faith of a loyal subject, advised them to flee by night for safety, and helped them to leave."

  - sp: HERMIONE
    o:
      - "Since what I am to say must be but that"
      - "Which contradicts my accusation and"
      - "The testimony on my part no other"
      - "But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me"
      - "To say “not guilty:” mine integrity"
      - "Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,"

      - "Behold our human actions, as they do,"
      - "I doubt not then but innocence shall make"
      - "False accusation blush and tyranny"
      - "Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,"
      - "Who least will seem to do so, my past life"
      - "Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,"
      - "As I am now unhappy; which is more"
      - "Than history can pattern, though devised"
      - "And play’d to take spectators. For behold me"

      - "A moiety of the throne a great king’s daughter,"
      - "The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing"
      - "To prate and talk for life and honour ’fore"
      - "Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it"
      - "As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,"
      - "’Tis a derivative from me to mine,"
      - "And only that I stand for. I appeal"
      - "To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes"
      - "Came to your court, how I was in your grace,"
      - "How merited to be so; since he came,"

      - "Of all that hear me, and my near’st of kin"
      - "Cry fie upon my grave!"
    m:
      - "Since what I’m going to say must contradict this accusation and the only testimony in my favor comes from me, it hardly helps to say “not guilty.” I’m believed to be a liar, so whatever I say will be considered false. But if the gods watch what we humans do, I don’t doubt that innocence will win out against false accusation and tyranny. You, my lord, know that my past life has been faithful, pure, and true, though you seem to know this least of anyone. Those qualities are now matched by my unhappiness, which is greater than history has ever seen, even if it were created and performed to enthrall an audience. Look at me, who has slept in the royal bed, who owns part of the throne as the daughter of a great king, the mother of the prince who will one day take the throne, forced to defend my life and my honor in front of anyone who cares to come and hear. I care as much for life as I do for grief, which I could do without. Honor, though, is passed down from me to my children, so I will make a stand for that. I appeal to your conscience to remember how you held me in good graces before Polixenes came to court, and how I deserved to be regarded so. Since he came to court, think of what was so unacceptable about my behavior that I now appear on trial. If I have acted in any way dishonorably, or even seemed inclined to do so, may all that hear me harden their hearts, and may even my closest relatives curse my grave!"

      - "For me to try how: all I know of it"

      - "And why he left your court, the gods themselves,"
      - "Wotting no more than I, are ignorant."
    m:
      - "I take full ownership of my faults, but I won’t acknowledge any faults that aren’t mine. I confess that I loved Polixenes in the manner his honor required, and with a love that was befitting a lady like me—with such a love, even, as you yourself commanded. If I hadn’t love him in this way, I would have been disobeying you and showing ingratitude to both you and your friend, who has loved you since childhood. Now, as for conspiracy, I don’t even know what it is like, even if it is being aimed at me. All I know is that Camillo was an honest man, and the gods know as little as I do about why he left your court."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "You knew of his departure, as you know"
      - "What you have underta’en to do in’s absence."

      - "My life stands in the level of your dreams,"
      - "Which I’ll lay down."
    m:
      - "Sir, I don’t understand what you are saying. I’ll give up my life, which is the target of your delusions."

  - sp: LEONTES
    o:
      - "Your actions are my dreams;"
      - "You had a bastard by Polixenes,"
      - "And I but dream’d it. As you were past all shame,—"
      - "Those of your fact are so—so past all truth:"
      - "Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as"
      - "Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,"
      - "No father owning it,—which is, indeed,"
      - "More criminal in thee than it,—so thou"
      - "Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage"
      - "Look for no less than death."
    m:
      - "My “delusions” are made of your actions. You had a bastard child with Polixenes—maybe I just dreamed it! You are past any shame, as women like you are, or any truth. Just as I’ve cast out your brat, whose lack of a father is more your fault than the child’s, I’ll devise a punishment for you, the least of which will be death."

  - sp: HERMIONE

      - "I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,"
      - "But know not how it went. My second joy"
      - "And first-fruits of my body, from his presence"
      - "I am barr’d, like one infectious. My third comfort"
      - "Starr’d most unluckily, is from my breast,"

      - "Haled out to murder: myself on every post"

      - "I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,"
      - "Tell me what blessings I have here alive,"
      - "That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed."
      - "But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,"
      - "I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,"
      - "Which I would free, if I shall be condemn’d"
      - "Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else"
      - "But what your jealousies awake, I tell you"
      - "’Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,"
      - "I do refer me to the oracle:"
      - "Apollo be my judge!"
    m:
      - "Sir, save your threats. I’d seek out the terrible punishment you threaten me with. Life has no value for me now. Having your favor was my highest goal and my comfort, and I give it up as lost now, though I don’t know how. My second joy in life, my first son, is kept from me as though I have a disease. My third comfort, that unlucky child with the innocent milk still in its innocent mouth, has been taken from my breast and dragged out to be murdered. I’ve been publicly declared a whore, with outrageous hatred denied the rest after childbirth that all women of my rank deserve, and hurried here into the open air before I’ve regained my strength. Now, my lord, tell me what I have to live for, and why I should fear death. Go ahead. But listen to what I say, which I say not for the sake of my life but for my honor: if I am condemned on mere guesses and your jealousy without any proof, it is merely severity and not justice. Your honors, I commend myself to the oracle, and let Apollo be my judge!"

When I was made mad by my jealousies and plotted bloody revenge, I asked Camillo to poison my friend Polixenes. It would have been done if Camillo hadn’t delayed doing it, even though I threatened to kill him if he didn’t and to reward him if he did. Even so, he was so humane and honorable that he revealed my plot, left his great fortunes here, and giving himself over to uncertainty, departed with only his honor. How much finer he appears next to me! And how his good deeds make my actions seem even worse!"

      - "How have you decided to torment me, tyrant? With wheels, racks, fires, or flaying? With lead or oil? What old or new torture must I receive, since my every word deserves the worst you could give me? Think of what your jealousy—which is too silly even for boys, and too immature and foolish for a nine-year-old girl—together with your tyranny has done, and then you’ll go mad! All of your earlier insanities were just a foretaste of this. Your betrayal of Polixenes was nothing—it just showed you to be a fickle and ungrateful fool. Neither was it much that you tried to tarnish Camillo’s honor by commissioning him to assassinate a king. These are just small misdeeds, with a more monstrous one waiting. I suppose the fact that you threw your baby daughter to the crows is little or nothing beside this, even though a devil would have shed tears from his fiery eyes before he did that. And the death of the young prince isn’t directly your fault. His heart tore in two at the thought that his gracious mother had been so disgraced by his vulgar and foolish father. This is not the worst act you’ll have to answer for. But this last deed—Oh, lords, when I have told you to grieve, it is because the queen, that dearest, sweetest creature, is dead, and she has not yet been avenged."

If you can bring any color or life to her lip or her eye, warm her body or cause her to breathe again, I’ll serve you as I would serve the gods. But, oh, you tyrant! Don’t try to repent now, because all your sorrow won’t change it. All you can do now is despair. If you had ten thousand years to spend naked, on your knees, fasting on a barren, wintry mountain in perpetual storms, the gods wouldn’t take pity on you."

    o:
      - "I am sorry for’t:"
      - "All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,"
      - "I do repent. Alas! I have show’d too much"
      - "The rashness of a woman: he is touch’d"
      - "To the noble heart. What’s gone and what’s past help"
      - "Should be past grief: do not receive affliction"
      - "At my petition; I beseech you, rather"
      - "Let me be punish’d, that have minded you"
      - "Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege"
      - "Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:"
      - "The love I bore your queen—lo, fool again!—"
      - "I’ll speak of her no more, nor of your children;"
      - "I’ll not remember you of my own lord,"
      - "Who is lost too: take your patience to you,"
      - "And I’ll say nothing."
    m:
      - "I’m sorry for it. I always repent for my faults once I am aware of them. Alas! I have been too rash, and he feels it in his heart. What has happened and can’t be fixed should be past grieving over. Don’t let my words make you feel bad. I beg you, instead, to punish me for reminding you of what you should forget. Now, my good and royal sir, forgive a foolish woman. The love I had for your queen—ah, I’m behaving like a fool again!—I won’t speak about her anymore, or of your children, and I won’t remind you of my husband, who is gone, too. Be patient, and I’ll be quiet."

    m:
      - "You spoke best when you told the truth, and I prefer it to being pitied. Please, take me to the dead bodies of my queen and son. I’ll bury them in one grave, and I’ll inscribe their gravestone with the cause of their death, to memorialize my shame. I’ll visit the chapel where they lie daily, and my pastime will be to shed tears. I’ll do it daily, as long as I am able to. Come, take me to this sorrowful sight."
