      - "O from what pow’r hast thou this pow’rful might,"
      - "With insufficiency my heart to sway,"
      - "To make me give the lie to my true sight,"
      - "And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?"
      - "Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,"
      - "That in the very refuse of thy deeds"
      - "There is such strength and warrantise of skill"
      - "That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?"
      - "Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,"
      - "The more I hear and see just cause of hate?"
      - "O, though I love what others do abhor,"
      - "With others thou shouldst not abhor my state."
      - "  If thy unworthiness raised love in me,"
      - "  More worthy I to be beloved of thee."

      - "Oh, what is the source of this mighty power you have, which controls my affections despite your inadequacies, making me disbelieve what my eyes truly see until I’m so turned around I swear that daylight isn’t bright? Where did you get this capacity to make bad things look good in you, to perform the most worthless actions so skillfully that I think your worst is better than anyone else’s best? Who taught you how to make me love you more, the more I hear and see good reasons to hate you? Oh, even though I love what other people despise, you shouldn’t despise my love the way other people do. Since your unworthiness made me love you, I’m the person who deserves your love."
