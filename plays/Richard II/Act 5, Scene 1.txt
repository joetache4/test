    ms: "London. A street leading to the Tower of London."

  - os: "Enter QUEEN and Ladies."
    ms: "The QUEEN and ladies enter."

  - sp: QUEEN
    o:
      - "This way the king will come; this is the way"
      - "To Julius Caesar’s ill-erected tower,"
      - "To whose flint bosom my condemned lord"
      - "Is doom’d a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:"
      - "Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth"
      - "Have any resting for her true king’s queen."
    m:
      - "The king will come this way as he is taken to the tower, where proud Bolingbroke condemned him to be held a prisoner. Let’s rest here, if there is anywhere on this rebellious earth where I can rest."

  - os: "Enter KING RICHARD II and Guard"
    ms: "KING RICHARD II and guards enter."

  - o:
      - "But soft, but see, or rather do not see,"
      - "My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,"
      - "That you in pity may dissolve to dew,"
      - "And wash him fresh again with true-love tears."
      - "Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,"
      - "Thou map of honour, thou King Richard’s tomb,"
      - "And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,"
      - "Why should hard-favour’d grief be lodged in thee,"
      - "When triumph is become an alehouse guest?"
    m:
      - "But wait, but look, or rather don’t look or you will wither. No, but look up, and let pity wash over you and your tears of love bathe him. Ah, you, fallen in greatness like Troy, the epitome of honor. You look like a shell of King Richard and not King Richard himself. Oh, why should grief live in you, who are so honorable and royal, while triumph lives within Bolingbroke, a commoner?"

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,"
      - "To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,"
      - "To think our former state a happy dream;"
      - "From which awaked, the truth of what we are"
      - "Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,"
      - "To grim Necessity, and he and I"
      - "Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France"
      - "And cloister thee in some religious house:"
      - "Our holy lives must win a new world’s crown,"
      - "Which our profane hours here have stricken down."
    m:
      - "Fair lady, don’t grieve as if I were already dead. Think of our past as a happy dream and that we have simply awoken to reality. I’ve had to bow to necessity, and I’ll stay that way until I die. Go quickly to France and join a convent. Our only hope is to become holy and be crowned in heaven, since our lives here have ended in such ruin."

  - sp: QUEEN
    o:
      - "What, is my Richard both in shape and mind"
      - "Transform’d and weaken’d? hath Bolingbroke deposed"
      - "Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?"
      - "The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,"
      - "And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage"
      - "To be o’erpower’d; and wilt thou, pupil-like,"
      - "Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,"
      - "And fawn on rage with base humility,"
      - "Which art a lion and a king of beasts?"
    m:
      - "What, has my Richard been changed and weakened in both body and mind? Has Bolingbroke overthrown your mind? Has he turned your heart? The dying lion claws at the earth, if nothing else, in his rage at being defeated. Will you act like a rebuked student and take your punishment meekly, kiss the cane that beats you, and return rage with humility, when you are a lion and king of beasts?"

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,"
      - "I had been still a happy king of men."
      - "Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:"
      - "Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,"
      - "As from my death-bed, thy last living leave."
      - "In winter’s tedious nights sit by the fire"
      - "With good old folks and let them tell thee tales"
      - "Of woeful ages long ago betid;"
      - "And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,"
      - "Tell thou the lamentable tale of me"
      - "And send the hearers weeping to their beds:"
      - "For why, the senseless brands will sympathize"
      - "The heavy accent of thy moving tongue"
      - "And in compassion weep the fire out;"
      - "And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,"
      - "For the deposing of a rightful king."
    m:
      - "A king of beasts, indeed. If only they weren’t beasts, I would still be a happy king of men. Good former queen, get ready to go to France. Think of me as dead, and say goodbye to me now as if I were on my deathbed. Through long winter nights sit by the fire with good people and let them tell you stories of sad times long ago. And before you say good night, tell them my sadder story and send them weeping to their beds. Even the firewood will sympathize and cry out their fires. And some will be so unhappy at the story of the overthrow of a rightful king that they will cover themselves in ashes."

  - os: "Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others"
    ms: "NORTHUMBERLAND and others enter."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:"
      - "You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower."
      - "And, madam, there is order ta’en for you;"
      - "With all swift speed you must away to France."
    m:
      - "My lord, Bolingbroke has changed his mind. You must go to Pomfret instead of the tower. And madam, he’s made arrangements for you to go to France as quickly as possible."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal"
      - "The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,"
      - "The time shall not be many hours of age"
      - "More than it is ere foul sin gathering head"
      - "Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,"
      - "Though he divide the realm and give thee half,"
      - "It is too little, helping him to all;"
      - "And he shall think that thou, which know’st the way"
      - "To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,"
      - "Being ne’er so little urged, another way"
      - "To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne."
      - "The love of wicked men converts to fear;"
      - "That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both"
      - "To worthy danger and deserved death."
    m:
      - "Northumberland, Bolingbroke is mounting my throne on your ladder, but it won’t take very long until you turn against each other. You’ll think that even though he gives you half the kingdom, it’s not enough, since you helped him get it all. And he’ll think that you, who knows how to put undeserving kings in the throne, will know how to remove him from the stolen throne. Wicked men’s love soon turns to fear, then to hate, and from there one or both of them will become dangerous and die a violent death."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "My guilt be on my head, and there an end."
      - "Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith."
    m:
      - "My guilt is on my own head, and that’s an end to it. Say goodbye and separate, for you must depart shortly."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate"
      - "A twofold marriage, ’twixt my crown and me,"
      - "And then betwixt me and my married wife."
      - "Let me unkiss the oath ’twixt thee and me;"
      - "And yet not so, for with a kiss ’twas made."
      - "Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,"
      - "Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;"
      - "My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,"
      - "She came adorned hither like sweet May,"
      - "Sent back like Hallowmas or short’st of day."
    m:
      - "Twice divorced! You force me to divorce my crown and now my wife. I can’t undo with a kiss the vows that bound us together, because they were sealed with a kiss. Separate us, Northumberland. I’ll go to the north, where cold and sickness afflict the region. And my wife goes to France, from where she came with celebration like the spring, and now is sent back like the dead of winter."

  - sp: QUEEN
    o:
      - "And must we be divided? must we part?"
    m:
      - "And do we have to be separated?"

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart."
    m:
      - "Yes, my love, our hands and our hearts must be divided."

  - sp: QUEEN
    o:
      - "Banish us both and send the king with me."
    m:
      - "Banish us both, and send the king with me."

  - sp: NORTHUMBERLAND
    o:
      - "That were some love but little policy."
    m:
      - "That might be an act of love, but it’s not a smart policy."

  - sp: QUEEN
    o:
      - "Then whither he goes, thither let me go."
    m:
      - "Then wherever he goes, let me follow him."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "So two, together weeping, make one woe."
      - "Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;"
      - "Better far off than near, be ne’er the near."
      - "Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans."
    m:
      - "So the two of us together will make one big sorrow. Weep for me in France, and I’ll weep for you here. It’s better for us to be far away than near, and never near each other again. Go measure the distance in sighs, and I’ll do the same with groans."

  - sp: QUEEN
    o:
      - "So longest way shall have the longest moans."
    m:
      - "So the farther I go, the longer I will moan."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "Twice for one step I’ll groan, the way being short,"
      - "And piece the way out with a heavy heart."
      - "Come, come, in wooing sorrow let’s be brief,"
      - "Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;"
      - "One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;"
      - "Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart."
    m:
      - "Since my way is shorter, I’ll groan twice for every step I take and make the way longer with a sad heart. Come, let’s cut short this talk of grief, because we’ll have long enough to live with it. Let’s kiss once and quiet our mouths and part without any more words. I give you my heart and take yours with me."

  - sp: QUEEN
    o:
      - "Give me mine own again; ’twere no good part"
      - "To take on me to keep and kill thy heart."
      - "So, now I have mine own again, be gone,"
      - "That I might strive to kill it with a groan."
    m:
      - "Give me my heart back. It will only kill your heart if I take it. So now that I have my own heart back, go, so I can try to kill my own with mourning."

  - sp: KING RICHARD II
    o:
      - "We make woe wanton with this fond delay:"
      - "Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say."
    m:
      - "We’re only encouraging sorrow with this delay. Once more, goodbye. My grief will say the rest."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
