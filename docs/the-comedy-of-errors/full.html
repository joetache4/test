<b>DUKE</b>
<p>Merchant of Syracuse, stop your begging: I’m not inclined to bend our laws. The hatred and discord between our two cities is the result of the bitter offenses your duke has perpetrated against the merchants of Ephesus, our well-behaved countrymen. Lacking the money to ransom themselves, these merchants were executed under your duke’s harsh laws, and this has erased all looks of pity from my face. Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours, both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns. No-the law goes further: if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse’s marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus, that man dies, and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke, unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself. Your possessions, even if we calculate their worth very generously, don’t even add up to a hundred marks. Therefore, by law, you are condemned to die.</p>

<b>EGEON</b>
<p>A heavier task could not have been imposed</p>
<p>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;</p>
<p>Yet, that the world may witness that my end</p>
<p>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,</p>
<p>I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.</p>
<p>In Syracusa was I born, and wed</p>
<p>Unto a woman happy but for me,</p>
<p>And by me, had not our hap been bad.</p>
<p>With her I lived in joy. Our wealth increased</p>
<p>By prosperous voyages I often made</p>
<p>To Epidamnum, till my factor’s death</p>
<p>And the great care of goods at random left</p>
<p>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;</p>
<p>From whom my absence was not six months old</p>
<p>Before herself-almost at fainting under</p>
<p>The pleasing punishment that women bear-</p>
<p>Had made provision for her following me</p>
<p>And soon and safe arrivèd where I was.</p>
<p>There had she not been long but she became</p>
<p>A joyful mother of two goodly sons,</p>
<p>And, which was strange, the one so like the other</p>
<p>As could not be distinguished but by names.</p>
<p>That very hour, and in the selfsame inn,</p>
<p>A meaner woman was deliverèd</p>
<p>Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.</p>
<p>Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,</p>
<p>I bought and brought up to attend my sons.</p>
<p>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</p>
<p>Made daily motions for our home return.</p>
<p>Unwilling, I agreed. Alas, too soon</p>
<p>We came aboard.</p>
<p>A league from Epidamnum had we sailed</p>
<p>Before the always-wind-obeying deep</p>
<p>Gave any tragic instance of our harm;</p>
<p>But longer did we not retain much hope;</p>
<p>For what obscured light the heavens did grant</p>
<p>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</p>
<p>A doubtful warrant of immediate death,</p>
<p>Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</p>
<p>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</p>
<p>Weeping before for what she saw must come,</p>
<p>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</p>
<p>That mourned for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</p>
<p>Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</p>
<p>And this it was, for other means was none:</p>
<p>The sailors sought for safety by our boat</p>
<p>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.</p>
<p>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</p>
<p>Had fastened him unto a small spare mast,</p>
<p>Such as seafaring men provide for storms.</p>
<p>To him one of the other twins was bound,</p>
<p>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.</p>
<p>The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</p>
<p>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed,</p>
<p>Fastened ourselves at either end the mast</p>
<p>And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,</p>
<p>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</p>
<p>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</p>
<p>Dispersed those vapors that offended us,</p>
<p>And by the benefit of his wished light</p>
<p>The seas waxed calm, and we discoverèd</p>
<p>Two ships from far, making amain to us,</p>
<p>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.</p>
<p>But ere they came,-O, let me say no more!</p>
<p>Gather the sequel by that went before.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>EGEON</b>
<p>Asking me to speak of my unspeakable griefs-that’s the hardest task you could impose on me. But I’ll do it so that the world can see that it was natural emotion, and not a desire to break the law, that brought me to this fate. I’ll tell you whatever my sorrow permits me to say. I was born in Syracuse, and I married a woman-a fortunate woman, except for having been married to me. And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad. I lived with her in joy, and our wealth increased from the prosperous journeys I frequently made to Epidamnum. Then my agent died and, obligated to care for my now untended goods abroad, I was drawn away from my wife’s fond embraces. I hadn’t been gone for six months when my wife, almost fainting with the pains of pregnancy, made arrangements to follow me, and she soon arrived safely where I was. She hadn’t been there very long before she became the joyful mother of twin boys. It was strange: they looked so much alike that the only way to tell them apart was by their names. In the same hour, and in the same inn, a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys. Their parents had very little, so I bought the boys and raised them as companions and servants for our twin sons. My wife was more than a little proud of our two boys, and every day she would press me to return home. Reluctantly, I agreed-alas! Too quickly, we boarded a ship. We had sailed a league away from Epidamnum before the sea, which always obeys the winds’ commands, gave any indication of danger. We didn’t stay hopeful much longer: soon, the sky grew so dark that we were convinced we were going to die immediately. I could have accepted that, but I was forced by my wife’s incessant weeping-she wept in advance for the things that she saw ahead-and the piteous complaints of the sweet infants-who cried in imitation of the adults, without understanding why-to find a way to save us. Here’s the best I could do: the crew of our ship had fled for safety in the lifeboats and left us to sink with the ship. My wife, who was very concerned about the younger of our twins, tied him to a spare mast-the kind that sailors use for just such a purpose. She tied one of the other twins to him. I did the same with the remaining two boys. With the children taken care of, my wife and I tied ourselves to opposite ends of the mast and floated off, obedient to the current. It carried us toward Corinth-or so we thought. Eventually the sun, looking down upon the earth, burned off the threatening storm clouds. By the power of the sun’s wished-for light, the seas became calm. We saw two ships sailing toward us, one from Corinth, the other from Epidaurus. But before they reached us-let me say no more! You’ll have to imagine what came next, based on what had already happened.</p>

<b>EGEON</b>
<p>O, had the gods done so, I had not now</p>
<p>Worthily termed them merciless to us.</p>
<p>For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</p>
<p>We were encounterd by a mighty rock,</p>
<p>Which being violently borne upon,</p>
<p>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</p>
<p>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</p>
<p>Fortune had left to both of us alike</p>
<p>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</p>
<p>Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdenèd</p>
<p>With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,</p>
<p>Was carried with more speed before the wind,</p>
<p>And in our sight they three were taken up</p>
<p>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</p>
<p>At length, another ship had seized on us</p>
<p>And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,</p>
<p>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwracked guests,</p>
<p>And would have reft the fishers of their prey</p>
<p>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</p>
<p>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</p>
<p>Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss;</p>
<p>That by misfortunes was my life prolonged</p>
<p>To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>EGEON</b>
<p>Had the gods taken pity on us, I wouldn’t be here calling them merciless. The two ships hadn’t come within ten leagues of us when our ship hit a huge rock and split down the middle. As we were unjustly separated from each other, both my wife and I were left with something to delight in and something to sorrow over. For her part-the poor soul! Her half of the mast weighed less, but she was no luckier than I was: the wind carried her away more quickly. I saw them rescued by fishermen from Corinth-or so I thought. After a while, another ship rescued me and the two boys who were with me. The sailors knew me, so they took good care of us. Our ship would have caught up with the other ship and taken back my wife and the children, but we sailed too slowly and their ship sped toward their home. So now you’ve heard how I was separated from everything I love. It’s been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes.</p>

<p>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</p>

<b>EGEON</b>
<p>My youngest son, whom I care about the most, turned eighteen and started to wonder about his twin brother. He asked me to let him take his attendant-who had also lost a brother, though he had kept his brother’s name for himself-and go in search of him. I wanted to see my lost son as well, so I risked losing the one I loved in order to find the other. I’ve spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia. On my way home, I came to Ephesus. I have no hope of finding my boys here, but I will check every place that is inhabited by men. But that is where the story of my life must end. I’d be happy to die if, in all my travels, I could prove that they are alive.</p>

Men, who are nearest to God, are the masters of all these creatures.

<p>Yes, yes, Antipholus: look bewildered and frown at me. You’ve given away all your sweet looks to some other woman—I am not Adriana nor your wife. There was a time when you’d freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them, that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you, that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches, and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it. How is it, my husband—oh, how is it—that you have become a stranger to yourself? I say yourself because you are a stranger to me now, but when we are indivisible and united in one body, I am better than the best part of you. Ah, don’t tear yourself away from me! For you should know, my love, that it would be as easy to let a drop of water fall into the churning sea and then fish it out again, unmingled and undiminished, as it would be to take yourself from me without taking me out of myself as well. How deeply would it cut you if you heard that I had been cheating on you and that my body—which is sworn for you only—had been contaminated by vile lust? Wouldn’t you spit at me, and spurn me, and throw our marriage vows in my face? Wouldn’t you tear the mark off my whorish forehead, cut the wedding ring off my finger, and swear to divorce me? I know you would, so go ahead. For I have, in fact, committed adultery, and my blood has been contaminated by lust. Because if marriage has made us one, then when you cheat, you poison my flesh as well—your contagion makes me a prostitute. So stay faithful to me and return to your marriage bed.That way, my reputation will be protected and your honor will be intact.</p>

<p>How distasteful! That a man of your stature would scheme with his servant to upset me like this. It may be my fault that you’ve been avoiding me, but don’t make things worse by treating me with contempt as well. I’ll hang on your sleeve: you’re an elm tree, my husband, and I’m a vine. My weakness is enhanced by your strength, which gives me the strength to say this: the things that take you away from me are worthless—just overgrown weeds in need of a trimming. They get into your system and infect you, feeding off your confusion.</p>

All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you. Let’s assume that she has a reason, which you don’t know yet: have faith that she’ll eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today. Listen to me. Be patient and leave, and we’ll all go to the Tiger for lunch. In the evening, come back alone and figure out this strange resistance. If you get violent and break in now, in broad daylight, people will talk about it. The common mob will presume things, and your untarnished reputation will be damaged—and that damage will last long after you’re dead.

<p>Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?</p>

<p>Be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator;</p>
<p>Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;</p>
<p>Apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger.</p>
<p>Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted.</p>
<p>Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint.</p>

<b>LUCIANA</b>
<p>Have you completely forgotten your duty as a husband? Antipholus, your marriage is still fresh and new, like the springtime—have the young shoots of your love already started to wither? Is the building of your love already in ruins? If you married my sister for her wealth, then for her wealth’s sake, treat her with more kindness. Or if your affection has already strayed to another woman, at least be stealthy about it. Hide your false love, blindfold yourself so my sister cannot read your faithlessness in your eyes. Watch what you say, and don’t let your own words give away your shame. Look sweet and act kindly—be attractive in your disloyalty. Disguise your misbehavior as integrity, and behave properly even if your heart is tainted. Though you are sinful, carry yourself like a holy saint. Be false in secret: why does she need to know? What foolish thief brags about his crimes? It’s doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes. When you do something shameful, it’s possible to put a good spin on it, but bad deeds are made worse by speaking of them. Alas, poor women! We’re so gullible, we believe it when you say you love us. Even if you love someone else in your heart, make it appear as if you love us. We follow in your orbit, and you have the power to move us. So, my sweet brother-in-law, go inside. Comfort my sister, cheer her up, call her “wife.” It’s a holy thing to lie a little when sweet flattery can smooth over trouble.</p>

<p>Nor to her bed no homage do I owe.</p>

<p>Sweet mistress—I don’t know what other name to give you, or how you’ve figured out mine—you seem as wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine. Teach me how I should think and speak. My understanding is clumsy and human, riddled with errors—it is feeble, shallow, and weak. Reveal to me the hidden meaning of your words. Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction? Are you a god? Are you trying to remake me? Go ahead, I’ll yield to your power. But if I am myself, then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife. I don’t owe her any duty—it’s you that I submit to. Oh, sweet mermaid, don’t command me to drown myself in the flood of your sister’s tears. Siren, use your song to make me love you instead, and I will obey. Spread your golden hair over the silver waves, and I will lie down in it like a bed. If a man could die in that glorious fantasy, then I think he would benefit by dying. Love is light and therefore floats—if my love is false, let me sink!</p>

<p>Antipholus has gone insane, no question about it. If not, he’d never behave like this. He has a ring of mine, worth forty ducats, and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it. Now he won’t give me either. The reason I think he’s insane, besides the way he just acted, is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house. His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he’s having. I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring. It’s my best option: I can’t afford to lose forty ducats.</p>

<p>And that’s why he went crazy. A jealous woman’s poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog. You disturbed his sleep with your complaining, which is why he’s disoriented. You seasoned his food with screams. Stress during mealtime ruins the digestion, and that gave him a raging fever. Fever, as we know, is a kind of madness. You spoiled his fun by fighting with him, and when people can’t enjoy themselves, they grow moody and dull with melancholy—they come very close to being grim and cheerlessly depressed. Next thing you know, all kinds of terrible illnesses break out. Ruining his meals, his enjoyment, and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad. What I’m saying is, your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity.</p>

He angered all the citizens by rushing into their houses and taking rings, jewels, and anything else he felt like. At one point I managed to get him tied up and sent home so that I could make some order out of all the trouble he caused. But somehow, he broke free from his guards. Then he and his crazy servant found us and chased us away with swords. We got more help and came back to capture them, but then they fled into this abbey.

He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine, where I was dining with Balthasar. He hadn’t arrived by the time we finished eating, so I went out looking for him. I met him in the street—he was there with that man. <em>(points to the SECOND MERCHANT)</em> That’s when this lying jeweler swore that he had already given me the necklace, which, God knows, he hadn’t. He had me arrested for it, and I went with the officer, sending my servant home to get money for the bail. When my servant returned empty-handed, I politely asked the officer to accompany me to my house. On the way, we came across my wife, her sister, and their gang of vile associates. One of them was a man named Pinch: a hungry, narrow-faced villain; a skeleton; a fraud; a raggedy magician and fortune-teller; a needy, hollow-eyed, emaciated wretch; a walking corpse. He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer, and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse. Then, with his thin face leering down at mine, he cried out that I was possessed. Then they all pounced on me, tied me up, carried me away, and left me in a dark, dank cellar in my house. They left me and my servant there, tied together. Eventually I chewed through the ropes and freed myself, and I immediately ran to find you, Your Grace.
