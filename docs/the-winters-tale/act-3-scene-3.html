<p>Come, poor babe:</p>
<p>I have heard, but not believed,</p>
<p>the spirits o’ the dead</p>
<p>May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother</p>
<p>Appear’d to me last night, for ne’er was dream</p>
<p>So like a waking. To me comes a creature,</p>
<p>Sometimes her head on one side, some another;</p>
<p>I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,</p>
<p>So fill’d and so becoming: in pure white robes,</p>
<p>Like very sanctity, she did approach</p>
<p>My cabin where I lay; thrice bow’d before me,</p>
<p>And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes</p>
<p>Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon</p>
<p>Did this break-from her: “Good Antigonus,</p>
<p>Since fate, against thy better disposition,</p>
<p>Hath made thy person for the thrower-out</p>
<p>Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,</p>
<p>Places remote enough are in Bohemia,</p>
<p>There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe</p>
<p>Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,</p>
<p>I prithee, call’t. For this ungentle business</p>
<p>Put on thee by my lord, thou ne’er shalt see</p>
<p>Thy wife Paulina more.” And so, with shrieks</p>
<p>She melted into air. Affrighted much,</p>
<p>I did in time collect myself and thought</p>
<p>This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:</p>
<p>Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,</p>
<p>I will be squared by this. I do believe</p>
<p>Hermione hath suffer’d death, and that</p>
<p>Apollo would, this being indeed the issue</p>
<p>Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,</p>
<p>Either for life or death, upon the earth</p>
<p>Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!</p>
<p>There lie, and there thy character: there these;</p>
<p>Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,</p>
<p>And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,</p>
<p>That for thy mother’s fault art thus exposed</p>
<p>To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,</p>
<p>But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I</p>
<p>To be by oath enjoin’d to this. Farewell!</p>
<p>The day frowns more and more: thou’rt like to have</p>
<p>A lullaby too rough: I never saw</p>
<p>The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!</p>
<p>Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:</p>
<p>I am gone for ever.</p>

<b>ANTIGONUS</b>
<p>Come, poor child. I’ve heard but never believed that the spirits of the dead might walk the earth. But perhaps it is true, because last night your mother appeared to me, and no dream ever seemed so real. She comes to me with her head to one side or the other, and I’ve never seen anyone so filled with sorrow and so beautiful. Dressed in pure white robes, she came to my room where I was resting. She bowed three times to me, and struggling to speak, she broke into tears. Once her fury was spent, these words came out: “Good Antigonus, since fate, against your good nature, has chosen you to cast out my child according to your oath, leave her in the remote places of Bohemia. There you weep, and leave the child crying. Since she is lost forever, I ask you to call her Perdita. Because of this terrible business forced upon you, you will never see your wife Paulina again.” And then she disappeared, shrieking. Very frightened, I finally got myself together and decided it had truly happened and wasn’t a dream. Dreams are just trifles, but for this once, even if it’s superstition, I’ll be ruled by one. I believe that Hermione has died, and that this child is truly the child of King Polixenes, so Apollo would want her to be left, whether to life or death, on the land of her real father. Blossom, fare you well! <em>(he lays down the child and a scroll)</em> Lie there, and I’ll put an account of your parentage with you. <em>(he puts down a box)</em> These jewels and gold will help pay for your upbringing, and if fortune pleases, leave some left over for you. * (thunder)* The storm is beginning. Poor child, because of your mother’s transgressions you are left out to die! I can’t weep, but my heart bleeds, and I’m cursed for having to do this deed. Farewell! The day gets worse and worse. You are likely to be lulled to sleep with a rough lullaby. I’ve never seen the sky look so dark during the day. What a savage noise! I’ll be lucky to get on board! This is the hunt! I’m gone forever.</p>

<p>I would there were no age between sixteen and</p>

<p>these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty</p>

<b>SHEPHERD</b>
<p>I wish that the ages between sixteen and twenty-three didn’t exist, or that young men would spend them asleep. Otherwise there is nothing between those ages but getting girls pregnant, acting dishonestly toward their elders, stealing, fighting—look at this! Would anyone but an addlebrained nineteen or twenty-two-year-old hunt in this weather? They’ve scared away two of my best sheep, which I’m afraid the wolf will find before I do. If I find them anywhere it’ll be by the shore, eating ivy. What is this here? Mercy, it’s a baby, a pretty baby! A boy or a girl, I wonder? A pretty one, a very pretty one. Here is the product of some forbidden affair. I’m not a scholar, but I can read the signs of a lady-in-waiting behind this. It must have been some secret sexual relationship carried out in back stairs, in large chests, or behind closed doors. The man and woman who conceived this child were more hot-blooded than the poor baby is. Out of pity I’ll take it, but I’ll wait here until my son comes. I heard him shout just a moment ago. Hallo!</p>

<p>I wish you could see how it rages and rushes up the shore! But that’s not the point. Oh, the pitiful cries of the men, coming in and out of sight. Then the ship would rise up so its mast looked like it hit the moon, and the next moment it was swallowed by the frothing waves. And then on land, I saw how the bear tore out his shoulder, and he cried to me for help. He said his name was Antigonus, and he was a nobleman. But to finish telling you about the ship, you should have seen how the sea swallowed it up. But first the poor men roared, and the sea mocked them, and then the poor gentleman roared, and the bear mocked him, and they both roared louder than either the sea or the storm.</p>
