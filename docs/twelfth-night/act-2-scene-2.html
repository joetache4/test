<p>She returns this ring to you, sir. You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself.

<p>I left no ring with her. What means this lady?</p>
<p>Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her!</p>
<p>She made good view of me, indeed so much</p>
<p>That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,</p>
<p>For she did speak in starts distractedly.</p>
<p>She loves me, sure! The cunning of her passion</p>
<p>Invites me in this churlish messenger.</p>
<p>None of my lord’s ring? Why, he sent her none.</p>
<p>I am the man. If it be so, as ’tis,</p>
<p>Poor lady, she were better love a dream.</p>
<p>Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness,</p>
<p>Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.</p>
<p>How easy is it for the proper false</p>
<p>In women’s waxen hearts to set their forms!</p>
<p>Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we,</p>
<p>For such as we are made of, such we be.</p>
<p>How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,</p>
<p>And I, poor monster, fond as much on him,</p>
<p>And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.</p>
<p>What will become of this? As I am man,</p>
<p>My state is desperate for my master’s love.</p>
<p>As I am woman, now, alas the day,</p>
<p>What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!</p>
<p>O time, thou must untangle this, not I.</p>
<p>It is too hard a knot for me to untie!</p>
</td>

<b>VIOLA</b>
<p>I didn’t give her any ring. What’s she trying to say? I hope she doesn’t have a crush on me! It’s true she looked at me a lot, in fact, she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted, and couldn’t really finish her sentences very well. Oh, I really think she loves me! She sent this rude messenger to tell me to come back, instead of coming herself, which would be indis- creet. She doesn’t want Orsino’s ring! Orsino never sent her a ring. I’m the man she wants. If that’s true, which it is, she might as well be in love with a dream, the poor lady. Now I understand why it’s bad to wear disguises. Disguises help the devil do his work. It’s so easy for a good-looking but deceitful man to make women fall in love with him. It’s not our fault—we women are weak. We can’t help what we’re made of. Ah, how will this all turn out? My lord loves her, and. poor me, I love him just as much. And she’s deluded enough to be in love with me. What can possibly fix this situation? I’m pretending to be a man, so my love for the Duke is hopeless. And since I’m a woman—too bad I’m a woman—Olivia’s love for me is hopeless as well! Oh, only time can sort out this mess. I can’t figure it out by myself!</p>
