  - os: "Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door, with drum and trumpet; at another CAESAR, LEPIDUS, ANTONY, ENOBARBUS, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA, with soldiers marching"
    ms: "A trumpet fanfare sounds. POMPEY and MENAS enter through one stage door to the music of a drum and a trumpet. CAESAR, LEPIDUS, ANTONY, ENOBARBUS, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA enter through another door, followed by soldiers."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "Your hostages I have, so have you mine,"
      - "And we shall talk before we fight."
    m:
      - "I have your hostages and you have mine. Let’s talk before we fight."

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "    Most meet"
      - "That first we come to words, and therefore have we"
      - "Our written purposes before us sent,"
      - "Which, if thou hast considered, let us know"
      - "If ’twill tie up thy discontented sword"
      - "And carry back to Sicily much tall youth"
      - "That else must perish here."
    m:
      - "It’s proper that we speak first, which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration. If you’ve had time to think over these points, let us know whether they will relieve your frustration. If yes, then a lot of brave young men can return to Sicily who would otherwise die here."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "    To you all three,"
      - "The senators alone of this great world,"
      - "Chief factors for the gods: I do not know"
      - "Wherefore my father should revengers want,"
      - "Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,"
      - "Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,"
      - "There saw you laboring for him. What was ’t"
      - "That moved pale Cassius to conspire? And what"
      - "Made the all-honored, honest Roman Brutus,"
      - "With the armed rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,"
      - "To drench the Capitol, but that they would"
      - "Have one man but a man? And that is it"
      - "Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden"
      - "The angered ocean foams, with which I meant"
      - "To scourge th’ ingratitude that despiteful Rome"
      - "Cast on my noble father."
    m:
      - "I address the three of you, the sole rulers of this world and the main arbiters of the gods’ will. I don’t know why my father’s death shouldn’t be avenged, since he has a son and friends to do it. You avenged Julius Caesar’s death at Philippi, where his ghost haunted his killer, Brutus. Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar? And why did the honorable, well-intentioned Brutus and the others, men devoted to the ideal of freedom, assassinate Caesar? They didn’t want one man to be king in Rome. And that’s why I’ve built my navy, which is so huge that the weight of the ships makes the sea foam with anger. I will punish Rome for her ingratitude toward my noble father."

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "    Take your time."
    m:
      - "Take your time."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails."
      - "We’ll speak with thee at sea. At land, thou know’st"
      - "How much we do o’ercount thee."
    m:
      - "Pompey, you cannot frighten us with your navy. We’ll meet you at sea. You know that on land our army is far greater than yours."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "    At land indeed"
      - "Thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house,"
      - "But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,"
      - "Remain in ’t as thou mayst."
    m:
      - "Yes, on land you do outnumber me. Even more since you annexed my father’s house and lands. But since, like the cuckoo, you don’t build anything for yourself, live in those lands as long as you can."

  - sp: LEPIDUS
    o:
      - "    Be pleased to tell us—"
      - "For this is from the present—how you take"
      - "The offers we have sent you."
    m:
      - "To get back to the matter at hand, what do you think of our proposal?"

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "    There’s the point."
    m:
      - "That’s the point."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "Which do not be entreated to, but weigh"
      - "What it is worth embraced."
    m:
      - "Don’t let us talk you into anything, but consider carefully the value of our offers."

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "    And what may follow, To try a larger fortune."
    m:
      - "And consider the possible consequences of fighting against us, in the hopes of gaining a greater fortune."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "    You have made me offer"
      - "Of Sicily, Sardinia. And I must"
      - "Rid all the sea of pirates, then, to send"
      - "Measures of wheat to Rome. This ’greed upon"
      - "To part with unhacked edges and bear back"
      - "Our targes undinted."
    m:
      - "You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia. In return, I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome. If I agree to this, we may leave unharmed, with our shields undented."

  - sp: CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS
    o:
      - "    That’s our offer."
    m:
      - "That’s our offer."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "    Know then"
      - "I came before you here a man prepared"
      - "To take this offer, but Mark Antony"
      - "Put me to some impatience. *(to ANTONY)*—Though I lose"
      - "The praise of it by telling, you must know,"
      - "When Caesar and your brother were at blows,"
      - "Your mother came to Sicily and did find"
      - "Her welcome friendly."
    m:
      - "You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer. But Mark Antony made me somewhat angry. *(to ANTONY)* Though it would be nobler to for me not to speak of this good act myself, you should know that when Caesar and your brother were fighting, your mother came to Sicily for refuge. I welcomed her gladly."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "*(to POMPEY)* I have heard it, Pompey,"
      - "And am well studied for a liberal thanks"
      - "Which I do owe you."
    m:
      - "*(to POMPEY)* I heard what you did for her, Pompey, and want to give you the many thanks I owe you."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "    Let me have your hand."
    m:
      - "Let me shake your hand."

  - os: "They clasp hands"
    ms: "They shake hands."

  - o:
      - "I did not think, sir, to have met you here."
    m:
      - "I didn’t think I would see you here."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "The beds i’ th’ East are soft, and thanks to you,"
      - "That called me timelier than my purpose hither,"
      - "For I have gained by ’t."
    m:
      - "The East is very seductive. I have you to thank for my trip here; I wouldn’t have left Egypt otherwise, and I have benefited from it."

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "*(to POMPEY)* Since I saw you last"
      - "There’s a change upon you."
    m:
      - "*(to POMPEY)* You’ve changed since the last time I saw you."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "    Well, I know not"
      - "What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face,"
      - "But in my bosom shall she never come"
      - "To make my heart her vassal."
    m:
      - "Well, I cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face, but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage."

  - sp: LEPIDUS
    o:
      - "    Well met here."
    m:
      - "It’s good we had this meeting."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed."
      - "I crave our composition may be written"
      - "And sealed between us."
    m:
      - "I hope it works out for the best, Lepidus. So we are in agreement. Please have the contract written up so we can all sign it."

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "    That’s the next to do."
    m:
      - "That’s the next thing on the agenda."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "We’ll feast each other ere we part, and let’s"
      - "Draw lots who shall begin."
    m:
      - "We’ll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways. Let’s draw lots to see who will host the first one."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "    That will I, Pompey."
    m:
      - "I’ll give the first one, Pompey."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "No, Antony, take the lot. But, first or last,"
      - "Your fine Egyptian cookery shall have"
      - "The fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar"
      - "Grew fat with feasting there."
    m:
      - "No, Antony. Pick one of these lots. Whether your banquet is first or last, your Egyptian cooking will make it the best. I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "You have heard much."
    m:
      - "You’ve heard a lot."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "I have fair meanings, sir."
    m:
      - "I mean well, sir."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "And fair words to them."
    m:
      - "I’m sure you do."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "Then so much have I heard."
      - "And I have heard Apollodorus carried—"
    m:
      - "I’ve heard a lot more. I heard that Apollodorus carried—"

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "*(interrupting POMPEY)* No more of that. He did so."
    m:
      - "*(interrupting POMPEY)* That’s enough of that. Yes, it’s true."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "    What, I pray you?"
    m:
      - "What did he carry, please?"

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress."
    m:
      - "A certain queen to Caesar, rolled up in a mattress."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "I know thee now. How far’st thou, soldier?"
    m:
      - "Now I know who you are. How are you, soldier?"

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "    Well,"
      - "And well am like to do, for I perceive,"
      - "Four feasts are toward."
    m:
      - "I’m well, and probably will be for a while, as I hear that four feasts are being prepared."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "    Let me shake thy hand."
      - "I never hated thee. I have seen thee fight"
      - "When I have envied thy behavior."
    m:
      - "Let me shake your hand. I’ve never been your enemy. I’ve seen you fight and envied your skill."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "    Sir,"
      - "I never loved you much, but I ha’ praised ye"
      - "When you have well deserved ten times as much"
      - "As I have said you did."
    m:
      - "Sir, I wouldn’t say I was your friend, but I’ve praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "    Enjoy thy plainness."
      - "It nothing ill becomes thee.—"
      - "Aboard my galley I invite you all."
      - "Will you lead, lords?"
    m:
      - "Enjoy your frankness; it suits you. I invite you all aboard my ship. After you, my lords?"

  - sp: CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS
    o:
      - "    Show ’s the way, sir."
    m:
      - "Show us the way, sir."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "    Come."
    m:
      - "Come with me."

  - os: "Exeunt all butENOBARBUS and MENAS"
    ms: "Everyone exits except for ENOBARBUS and MENAS."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "*(aside)* Thy father, Pompey, would ne’er have made this"
      - "treaty. *(to ENOBARBUS)* You and I have known, sir."
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* Your father would never have agreed to this treaty, Pompey. *(to ENOBARBUS)* You and I have met, sir."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "At sea, I think."
    m:
      - "I think it was at sea."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "We have, sir."
    m:
      - "That it was, sir."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "You have done well by water."
    m:
      - "You’ve done well at sea."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "And you by land."
    m:
      - "And you’ve done well on land."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "I will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot be denied what I have done by land."
    m:
      - "I’ll flatter anyone who flatters me—though what I’ve accomplished on land cannot be denied."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "Nor what I have done by water."
    m:
      - "Neither can my accomplishments at sea."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a great thief by sea."
    m:
      - "Yes, for your own safety, you should deny one thing: you have been a great thief at sea."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "And you by land."
    m:
      - "As you were on land."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "There I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas."
    m:
      - "That’s the one part of my service on land I do deny. But let’s shake hands, Menas."

  - os: "They clasp hands"
    ms: "They shake."

  - o:
      - "  If our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing."
    m:
      - "If our eyes were policemen, they might capture two thieves at once while we’re embracing."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "All men’s faces are true, whatsome’er their hands are."
    m:
      - "Men’s faces are truthful, whatever their hands do."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "But there is never a fair woman has a true face."
    m:
      - "But no beautiful woman has an honest face."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "No slander. They steal hearts."
    m:
      - "That’s no lie. They steal hearts."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "We came hither to fight with you."
    m:
      - "We came here to fight against you."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune."
    m:
      - "For my part, I’m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match. Today Pompey laughs away his fortune."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "If he do, sure he cannot weep ’t back again."
    m:
      - "If that’s true, he won’t get it back by crying."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "You’ve said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony here. Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?"
    m:
      - "That’s the truth, sir. We didn’t expect Mark Antony to be here. Is he married to Cleopatra?"

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "Caesar’s sister is called Octavia."
    m:
      - "Caesar’s sister is named Octavia."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "True, sir. She was the wife of Caius Marcellus."
    m:
      - "That’s true, sir. She was previously Caius Marcellus’ wife."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius."
    m:
      - "But she is now Mark Antony’s wife."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "Pray ye, sir?"
    m:
      - "Excuse me, sir?"

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "’Tis true."
    m:
      - "It’s true."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "Then is Caesar and he forever knit together."
    m:
      - "Then Caesar and he will always be united."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so."
    m:
      - "If I were to make a prediction regarding this union, I wouldn’t say that."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties."
    m:
      - "I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation."
    m:
      - "I think so too. But you’ll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them. Octavia has a pious, chaste, meek disposition."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "Who would not have his wife so?"
    m:
      - "Doesn’t everyone want a wife like that?"

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again. Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is. He married but his occasion here."
    m:
      - "Not someone who doesn’t share that disposition, meaning Mark Antony. He’ll go back to his Egyptian dish. Then Octavia’s complaints will rouse Caesar, and as I said before, the thing that brought them together will part them. Antony will go where his passion is. He only married out of political necessity."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you."
    m:
      - "Then that’s the way it may turn out. Come on, sir, will you come aboard? I want to drink your health."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "I shall take it, sir. We have used our throats in Egypt."
    m:
      - "I’ll join you, sir. We did a lot of drinking in Egypt."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "Come, let’s away."
    m:
      - "Let’s go."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
