<p>Caesar. So you’d better not stay with him, Antony. Your guardian angel is noble, courageous, significant, and unmatched when Caesar’s not around. But when you are with him, your angel is weakened and easily frightened. That’s why there must be space between you.</p>

<p>To none but you, only to you. You will surely lose any game you play with Caesar. With his natural luck, he will beat you even against the odds. Your light dulls when he is near. I repeat: your angel is afraid to inspire you when you’re around him, but when he goes away it becomes brilliant again.</p>

<p><em>(to himself)</em> I’ll send him to Parthia. Whether he’s truly gifted or just lucky, what the Fortuneteller said is true. Even the dice obey Caesar. When we compete in sports, my skill is defeated by his luck. If we pick numbers in a lottery, he wins. His roosters always beat mine at the cockfights. His quails beat mine, even against the odds, when mine have the advantage. I’ll return to Egypt. Though I’ve made this marriage to keep peace with Caesar, my pleasure remains in the East, with Cleopatra.</p>
