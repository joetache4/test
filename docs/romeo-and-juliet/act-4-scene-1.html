<p>Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,</p>

<p>That she do give her sorrow so much sway,</p>

<p>To stop the inundation of her tears—</p>

<p>She’s grieving too much over the death of Tybalt. So I haven’t had the chance to talk to her about love. Romantic love doesn’t happen when people are in mourning. Now, sir, her father thinks it’s dangerous that she allows herself to become so sad. He’s being smart by rushing our marriage to stop her from crying. She cries too much by herself. If she had someone to be with her, she would stop crying. Now you know the reason for the rush.</p>

You joined our hands. And before I—who was married to Romeo by you—am married to another man, I’ll kill myself. You are wise and you have so much experience. Give me some advice about the current situation. Or watch. Caught between these two difficulties, I’ll act like a judge with my bloody knife. I will truly and honorably resolve the situation that you can’t fix, despite your experience and education. Don’t wait long to speak. I want to die if what you say isn’t another solution.</p>

<p>If, rather than to marry County Paris,</p>
<p>Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,</p>

<p>Hold on, daughter, I see some hope. But we must act boldly because the situation is so desperate. If you’ve made up your mind to kill yourself instead of marrying Count Paris, then you’ll probably be willing to try something like death to solve this shameful problem. You can wrestle with death to escape from shame. And if you dare to do it, I’ll give you the solution.</p>

Or tell me to climb down into a freshly dug grave, and hide me with a dead man in his tomb. All those ideas make me tremble when I hear them named.

<p>Hold, then. Go home, be merry. Give consent</p>

<p>Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.</p>
<p><em>(shows her a vial)</em></p>
<p>Take thou this vial, being then in bed,</p>
<p>And this distillèd liquor drink thou off,</p>
<p>When presently through all thy veins shall run</p>
<p>A cold and drowsy humor, for no pulse</p>
<p>Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.</p>
<p>No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.</p>
<p>The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade</p>
<p>To paly ashes, thy eyes’ windows fall</p>
<p>Like death when he shuts up the day of life.</p>
<p>Each part, deprived of supple government,</p>
<p>Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death.</p>
<p>And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death</p>
<p>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,</p>
<p>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.</p>
<p>Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes</p>
<p>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.</p>
<p>Then, as the manner of our country is,</p>
<p>In thy best robes uncovered on the bier</p>
<p>Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault</p>
<p>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.</p>
<p>In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,</p>
<p>Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,</p>
<p>And hither shall he come, and he and I</p>
<p>Will watch thy waking, and that very night</p>
<p>Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.</p>
<p>And this shall free thee from this present shame,</p>
<p>If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,</p>
<p>Abate thy valor in the acting it.</p>

<b>FRIAR LAWRENCE</b>
<p>Hold on, then. Go home, be cheerful, and tell them you agree to marry Paris. Tomorrow is Wednesday. Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone. Don’t let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom. <em>(showing her a vial)</em> When you’re in bed, take this vial, mix its contents with liquor, and drink. Then a cold, sleep-inducing drug will run through your veins, and your pulse will stop. Your flesh will be cold, and you’ll stop breathing. The red in your lips and your cheeks will turn pale, and your eyes will shut. It will seem like you’re dead. You won’t be able to move, and your body will be stiff like a corpse. You’ll remain in this deathlike state for forty-two hours, and then you’ll wake up as if from a pleasant sleep. Now, when the bridegroom comes to get you out of bed on Thursday morning, you’ll seem dead. Then, as tradition demands, you’ll be dressed up in your best clothes, put in an open coffin, and carried to the Capulet family tomb. Meanwhile, I’ll send Romeo word of our plan. He’ll come here, and we’ll keep a watch for when you wake up. That night, Romeo will take you away to Mantua. This plan will free you from the shameful situation that troubles you now as long as you don’t change your mind, or become scared like a silly woman and ruin your brave effort.</p>
