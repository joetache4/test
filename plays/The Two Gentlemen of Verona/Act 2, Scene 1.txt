      - "Sir, your glove."

  - os: "He offers a glove."
    ms: "He offers a glove."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Not mine. My gloves are on."
    m:
      - "That isn’t mine. I’m already wearing my gloves."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one."
    m:
      - "Well, then, this may be your glove, because it’s all by itself."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Ha! let me see. Ay, give it me, it’s mine."
      - "Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!"
      - "Ah, Sylvia, Sylvia!"
    m:
      - "Ha! Let me see it. Yes, give it to me. It’s mine. Sweet accessory that Sylvia’s divine hand wears. Ah Sylvia, Sylvia!"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "*(Calling)* Madam Sylvia! Madam Sylvia!"
    m:
      - "*(calling)* Madame Sylvia! Madama Sylvia!"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "How now, sirrah?"
    m:
      - "What are you doing, pal?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "She is not within hearing, sir."
    m:
      - "She’s too far away to hear me, sir."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Why, sir, who bade you call her?"
    m:
      - "But, sir, who asked you to call out for her?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Your worship, sir, or else I mistook."
    m:
      - "You did, sir, or else I misunderstood you."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Well, you’ll still be too forward."
    m:
      - "Well, you’re always too presumptuous."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "And yet I was last chidden for being too slow."
    m:
      - "Even though last time I was scolded for being too slow."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Go to, sir. Tell me, do you know Madam Sylvia?"
    m:
      - "Enough, sir. Tell me, do you know Madame Sylvia?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "She that your worship loves?"
    m:
      - "The Madame Sylvia you love, your worship?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Why, how know you that I am in love?"
    m:
      - "Why, how do you know that I am in love?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreath your arms, like a malcontent; to relish a love-song, like a robin redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had the pestilence; to sigh, like a schoolboy that had lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes diet; to watch, like one that fears robbing; to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you looked sadly, it was for want of money. And now you are metamorphosed with a mistress, that when I look on you, I can hardly think you my master."
    m:
      - "Because of all the right signs, of course: First, like Sir Proteus, you have started to fold your arms like you’re unhappy about something. You go around singing love songs like a redbreasted robin. You walk alone, like one who has the plague. You sigh like a schoolboy who has lost his textbook. You weep, like a young girl who has just buried her grandmother. You don’t eat, like one who’s on a diet. You can’t sleep, like one who fears being robbed. You whine, like a beggar on Hallowmas It used to be that when you laughed, you crowed like a rooster. When you walked, you walked like a lion. When you didn’t eat, it was because you’d just finished lunch. When you looked sad, it was because you were out of money. And now a mistress has changed you. When I look at you, I can hardly recognize you as my master."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Are all these things perceived in me?"
    m:
      - "Can you see all these things in me?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "They are all perceived without ye."
    m:
      - "They are all outside of you, in your outward appearance."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Without me? They cannot."
    m:
      - "Outside of me? They cannot be outside of me."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Without you? Nay, that’s certain, for, without you were so simple, none else would. But you are so without these follies that these follies are within you, and shine through you"
      - "like the water in an urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady."
    m:
      - "Outside of you? No, I’m sure, because if you weren’t so obvious no one would see them. But your appearance is so marked by these foolish traits that they must be inside you, and they shine through you as if you were water in a jar. Everyone that sees you is like a physician who knows why you’re sick."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "But tell me, dost thou know my lady Sylvia?"
    m:
      - "But tell me, do you know my lady Sylvia?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?"
    m:
      - "The woman you stare at while she sits at the dinner table?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Hast thou observed that? Even she I mean."
    m:
      - "Have you noticed me doing that? Yes, that’s the woman I mean."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Why, sir, I know her not."
    m:
      - "Well, sir, I don’t know her at all."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know’st her not?"
    m:
      - "Do you know her only by my staring at her and not otherwise?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Is she not hard-favored, sir?"
    m:
      - "Isn’t she ugly, sir?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Not so fair, boy, as well-favored."
    m:
      - "She’s not as beautiful, boy, as she is gracious."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Sir, I know that well enough."
    m:
      - "Sir, I know that very well."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "What dost thou know?"
    m:
      - "What do you know?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favored."
    m:
      - "The she isn’t as pretty as she is looked on favorably by you."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "I mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favor infinite."
    m:
      - "I mean that her beauty is exquisite but her graciousness is infinite."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "That’s because the one is painted and the other out of all count."
    m:
      - "That’s because the first one is done with makeup and the other can’t be counted."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "How painted? And how out of count?"
    m:
      - "What do you mean, done with makeup? And why can’t you count the other?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts of her beauty."
    m:
      - "I mean, sir, she’s so painted with makeup to look beautiful that no man values her beauty."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "How esteem’st thou me? I account of her beauty."
    m:
      - "So what do you think of me, then? I think she’s very beautiful."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "You never saw her since she was deformed."
    m:
      - "You haven’t seen her since she was deformed."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "How long hath she been deformed?"
    m:
      - "How long has she been deformed?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Ever since you loved her."
    m:
      - "Ever since you fell in love with her."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "I have loved her ever since I saw her, and still I see her beautiful."
    m:
      - "I have loved her ever since I first saw her, and I still think she’s beautiful."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "If you love her, you cannot see her."
    m:
      - "If you love her then you cannot see her."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Why?"
    m:
      - "Why not?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes, or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered!"
    m:
      - "Because Love is blind. Oh, if you had my eyes, or if you could see as clearly as you did when you scolded Sir Proteus for not wearing a garter!"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "What should I see then?"
    m:
      - "What would I see then?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Your own present folly and her passing deformity; for he, being in love, could not see to garter his hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose."
    m:
      - "Your own current foolishness and her enormous deformity. Proteus, because he was in love, forgot to put on a garter to keep his stockings up, and you, also being in love, can’t see well enough to even put on your stockings."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Belike, boy, then you are in love, for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes."
    m:
      - "Then maybe, boy, you’re in love, because this morning you couldn’t see well enough to polish my shoes."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "True, sir. I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you swinged me for my love, which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours."
    m:
      - "True, sir. I was in love with my bed. I thank you—you hit me because I was so in love, which has made me bold enough to scold you for your love."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "In conclusion, I stand affected to her."
    m:
      - "In conclusion, I’m in love with her."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "I would you were set; so your affection would cease."
    m:
      - "I wish you weren’t standing erect. Maybe then your love would go away."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves."
    m:
      - "Last night she asked me to write some lines of poetry to the one she loves."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "And have you?"
    m:
      - "And did you?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "I have."
    m:
      - "I did."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Are they not lamely writ?"
    m:
      - "They’re badly written, aren’t they?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace, here she comes."
    m:
      - "No, boy, I wrote them as well as I could. Be quiet now—here she comes."

  - os: "Enter SYLVIA"
    ms: "SYLVIA enters."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "*(aside)* O, excellent motion! O, exceeding puppet! Now will he interpret to her."
    m:
      - "*(aside)* Oh, what a puppet show! Such a wonderful puppet she makes. Now he’ll give his commentary on the show."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows."
    m:
      - "Madame and mistress, I wish you a thousand good mornings."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "*(aside)* O, give ye good even! Here’s a million of manners."
    m:
      - "*(aside)* And God give you a good evening! What manners!"

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand."
    m:
      - "Sir Valentine and servant, to you I wish two thousand good mornings."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "*(aside)* He should give her interest, and she gives it him."
    m:
      - "*(aside)* He should outdo her in compliments, but she outdoes him."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "As you enjoined me, I have writ your letter"
      - "Unto the secret, nameless friend of yours,"
      - "Which I was much unwilling to proceed in"
      - "But for my duty to your ladyship."
    m:
      - "As you asked, I have written your letter to that secret, anonymous friend of yours. Though I didn’t want to do it, I wrote it out of duty to your ladyship."

  - os: "He gives Sylvia a letter."
    ms: "He gives Sylvia a letter."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "I thank you, gentle servant. ’Tis very clerkly done."
    m:
      - "I thank you, gentle servant. It’s very smartly written."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;"
      - "For, being ignorant to whom it goes,"
      - "I writ at random, very doubtfully."
    m:
      - "Now trust me, madame, it wasn’t easy to write this, because I had to be somewhat vague since I didn’t know to whom it would go."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "Perchance you think too much of so much pains?"
    m:
      - "Perhaps you think it was too much trouble?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "No, madam. So it stead you, I will write—"
      - "Please you command—a thousand times as much."
      - "And yet—"
    m:
      - "No, madame. If it helps you, I will write a thousand times as many lines if you like. And yet . . ."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;"
      - "And yet I will not name it—and yet I care not—"
      - "And yet take this again—and yet I thank you,"
      - "Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more."
    m:
      - "A fine pause! I can guess what you’re going to say next. And yet I will not say it. And yet I don’t care. And yet you can take this back. And yet thanks anyway, meaning I won’t bother you again."

  - os: "She offers him the letter."
    ms: "She offers him the letter."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "*(aside)* And yet you will, and yet another “yet.”"
    m:
      - "*(aside)* And yet you will, and yet say another “yet.”"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "What means your ladyship? Do you not like it?"
    m:
      - "What do you mean, your ladyship? Don’t you like it?"

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "Yes, yes. The lines are very quaintly writ,"
      - "But, since unwillingly, take them again."
      - "Nay, take them."
    m:
      - "Yes, yes. The lines are very nicely written, but since you wrote them so unwillingly, take them back. No, take them."

  - os: "She gives back the letter."
    ms: "She gives back the letter."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Madam, they are for you."
    m:
      - "Madame, they are for you."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "Ay, ay. You writ them, sir, at my request,"
      - "But I will none of them. They are for you."
      - "I would have had them writ more movingly."
    m:
      - "Yes, yes. You wrote them, sir, at my request, but I don’t want them. They are for you. I wish they had been more movingly written."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Please you, I’ll write your ladyship another."
    m:
      - "If it pleases you, I’ll write another for your ladyship."

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "And when it’s writ, for my sake read it over."
      - "And if it please you, so; if not, why, so."
    m:
      - "And when it’s written, read it over for my sake. And if it pleases you, fine. And if it doesn’t, well, that’s also fine."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "If it please me, madam, what then?"
    m:
      - "If it pleases me, madame, what then?"

  - sp: SYLVIA
    o:
      - "Why, if it please you, take it for your labor."
      - "And so good morrow, servant."
    m:
      - "Why, if it pleases you, then take it as payment for your hard work. And so good morning and goodbye to you, servant."

  - os: "Exit SYLVIA"
    ms: "SYLVIA exits."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "*(aside)* O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible"
      - "As a nose on a man’s face or a weathercock on a steeple!"
      - "My master sues to her, and she hath taught her suitor,"
      - "He being her pupil, to become her tutor."
      - "O excellent device! Was there ever heard a better,"
      - "That my master, being scribe, to himself should write the letter?"
    m:
      - "*(aside)* Oh, that joke is as hard to see as a nose on a man’s face or a weathercock on a steeple! My master pleads with her, and she has taught him, her student, to become her teacher. What an excellent trick! Has anyone ever heard anything better than my master, the scribe, writing the letter to himself?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "How now, sir? What, are you reasoning with yourself?"
    m:
      - "What’s that, sir? What are you reasoning to yourself over there?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Nay, I was rhyming. ’Tis you that have the reason."
    m:
      - "No, I was rhyming. It’s you who’s been doing the reasoning."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "To do what?"
    m:
      - "Reasoning what?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "To be a spokesman from Madam Sylvia."
    m:
      - "To be a spokesman for Madame Sylvia."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "To whom?"
    m:
      - "To whom?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "To yourself. Why, she woos you by a figure."
    m:
      - "To yourself. Why, she’s wooing you indirectly with this trick."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "What figure?"
    m:
      - "What trick?"

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "By a letter, I should say."
    m:
      - "By a letter, I should say."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "Why, she hath not writ to me."
    m:
      - "But, she hasn’t written to me."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?"
    m:
      - "Why would she need to when she’s made you write to yourself? Why, don’t you get the joke?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "No, believe me."
    m:
      - "No, believe me."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive her earnest?"
    m:
      - "No believing you, indeed, sir. Did you think she was being serious?"

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "She gave me none, except an angry word."
    m:
      - "She gave me nothing except an angry word."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Why, she hath given you a letter."
    m:
      - "Why, she’s given you a letter."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "That’s the letter I writ to her friend."
    m:
      - "That’s the letter I wrote to her friend."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end."
    m:
      - "And she’s delivered that letter, and that’s the end of it."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "I would it were no worse."
    m:
      - "I wish it were that good."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "I’ll warrant you, ’tis as well."
      - "For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,"
      - "Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;"
      - "Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,"
      - "Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover."
      - "All this I speak in print, for in print I found it. Why muse you, sir? ’Tis dinner time."
    m:
      - "I promise you, it is that good. Because you’ve often written to her, and she, whether out of modesty or because she didn’t have the time, or out of fear that the messenger carrying the letter would discover her feelings, couldn’t reply. So she taught the man she loves to write to himself. I say all this very carefully, because I read it in her as if it were printed on a page. Why do you look so pensive, sir? It’s lunchtime."

  - sp: VALENTINE
    o:
      - "I have dined."
    m:
      - "I’ve already eaten."

  - sp: SPEED
    o:
      - "Ay, but hearken, sir: though the chameleon Love can feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like your mistress; be moved, be moved!"
    m:
      - "Yes, but listen, sir: even though the chameleon Love can feed off the air, I need real food for nourishment, and I’m eager to have meat. Oh, don’t be like your mistress—have a heart!"

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
