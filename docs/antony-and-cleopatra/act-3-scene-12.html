<p>It’s Antony’s schoolmaster. By sending such an insignificant emissary, Antony shows us how low he has sunk. Not so long ago, he had so many royal supporters that he sent along extra kings as messengers.</p>

<p>He acknowledges that you are the master of his fate, and he requests to be allowed to live in Egypt. If that is not granted, he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens. That’s all he asks for himself. Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority. She only asks that the crown of Egypt pass to her heirs, who are now at your mercy.</p>

<p>As for Antony, I’m not interested in his requests. I’ll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him. Then I’ll listen to her. Give my answer to them both.</p>
