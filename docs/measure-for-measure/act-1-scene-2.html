<p>Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract</p>
<p>I got possession of Julietta’s bed:</p>
<p>You know the lady; she is fast my wife,</p>
<p>Save that we do the denunciation lack</p>
<p>Of outward order: this we came not to,</p>
<p>Only for propagation of a dower</p>
<p>Remaining in the coffer of her friends,</p>
<p>From whom we thought it meet to hide our love</p>
<p>Till time had made them for us. But it chances</p>
<p>The stealth of our most mutual entertainment</p>
<p>With character too gross is writ on Juliet.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened: I slept with Julietta after we got engaged. You know her—she’s practically my wife, except that we haven’t had an official ceremony. The only reason we didn’t was to increase the amount of the dowry she might receive from her friends and relatives. We thought we’d hide our love until we had a chance to win them over. But it turned out our secret intimacy had an all-too-obvious effect on Juliet.</p>

<p>Unhappily, even so.</p>
<p>And the new deputy now for the duke—</p>
<p>Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,</p>
<p>Or whether that the body public be</p>
<p>A horse whereon the governor doth ride,</p>
<p>Who, newly in the seat, that it may know</p>
<p>He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;</p>
<p>Whether the tyranny be in his place,</p>
<p>Or in his emmence that fills it up,</p>
<p>I stagger in:—but this new governor</p>
<p>Awakes me all the enrolled penalties</p>
<p>Which have, like unscour’d armour, hung by the wall</p>
<p>So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round</p>
<p>And none of them been worn; and, for a name,</p>
<p>Now puts the drowsy and neglected act</p>
<p>Freshly on me: ’tis surely for a name.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, yes. And this new deputy of the duke’s—I can’t say whether he’s been blinded by his new power or if he sees the public like a horse to be broken in, so he digs his spurs in right away to show it who’s boss; or if he’s just a bully; or if being a bully is part of the job. But this new governor is taking all these old penalties that, like rusty armor hanging on the wall, haven’t been used in years and is applying them to me. He’s imposing all these unenforced, long-ignored laws on me to make a name for himself. That has to be it, to make his name.</p>

<p>I have done so, but he’s not to be found.</p>
<p>I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:</p>
<p>This day my sister should the cloister enter</p>
<p>And there receive her approbation:</p>
<p>Acquaint her with the danger of my state:</p>
<p>Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends</p>
<p>To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:</p>
<p>I have great hope in that; for in her youth</p>
<p>There is a prone and speechless dialect,</p>
<p>Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art</p>
<p>When she will play with reason and discourse,</p>
<p>And well she can persuade.</p>

<p>I tried, but he can’t be found. Please, Lucio, do this favor for me: My sister’s entering a nunnery and starting her training period today. Tell her the danger I’m in, and implore her, in my name, to befriend this strict deputy and try to change his mind. I’ve got a lot of hope in her. Her youthful sweetness alone would move a man. Besides, she has a gift for rhetoric, and she can really persuade people.</p>
