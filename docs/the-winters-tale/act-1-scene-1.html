<p>Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.</p>
<p>They were trained together in their childhoods; and</p>
<p>there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,</p>
<p>which cannot choose but branch now. Since their</p>
<p>more mature dignities and royal necessities made</p>
<p>separation of their society, their encounters,</p>
<p>though not personal, have been royally attorneyed</p>
<p>with interchange of gifts, letters, loving</p>
<p>embassies; that they have seemed to be together,</p>
<p>though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and</p>
<p>embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed</p>
<p>winds. The heavens continue their loves!</p>

<b>CAMILLO</b>
<p>The King of Sicily could never be anything but kind to the King of Bohemia. They were brought up together as children, and so they have a deep-rooted affection for one another that can only grow. Because of their adult responsibilities and their duties as kings, they have not been able to meet personally. Instead their meetings have taken place via royal deputies and through the exchange of presents, letters, and fond words. Through these means they’ve stayed in touch despite the great distance between them. May the heavens keep their friendship strong!</p>

<p>I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it</p>
<p>is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the</p>

<p>see him a man.</p>

<p>I agree with you regarding his potential. He is a noble child, and he is like a medicine for his subjects. The old feel young, and those who were crippled even before he was born now hope to live long enough to see him grow into a man.</p>
