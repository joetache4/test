  - os: "Enter REGAN and the steward OSWALD"
    ms: "REGAN enters with OSWALD."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "But are my brother’s powers set forth?"
    m:
      - "Have my brother-in-law’s troops been mobilized?"

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "    Ay, madam."
    m:
      - "Yes, ma’am."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "Himself in person there?"
    m:
      - "Is he there in person?"

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "Madam, with much ado."
      - "Your sister is the better soldier."
    m:
      - "Yes, making a big fuss. Your sister’s the better soldier of the two."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?"
    m:
      - "Lord Edmund didn’t speak to your master at home?"

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "No, madam."
    m:
      - "No, ma’am."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "What might import my sister’s letter to him?"
    m:
      - "What could my sister’s letter to him say?"

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "I know not, lady."
    m:
      - "I don’t know, ma’am."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter."
      - "It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out,"
      - "To let him live. Where he arrives he moves"
      - "All hearts against us. Edmund I think is gone"
      - "In pity of his misery to dispatch"
      - "His nighted life; moreover to descry"
      - "The strength o’ th’ enemy."
    m:
      - "He rushed away on serious business. It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him. Wherever he goes, he inspires compassion and people turn against us. I think Edmund went off to kill him, to put him out of his blind misery. And also to find out the size of the enemy army."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "I must needs after him, madam, with my letter."
    m:
      - "I have to follow him and give him the letter."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "Our troops set forth tomorrow. Stay with us."
      - "The ways are dangerous."
    m:
      - "Our troops are deployed tomorrow. Stay with us tonight. It’s dangerous out there."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "  I may not, madam."
      - "My lady charged my duty in this business."
    m:
      - "I can’t, ma’am. My lady ordered me to deliver her letter."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you"
      - "Transport her purposes by word? Belike"
      - "Some things—I know not what. I’ll love thee much."
      - "Let me unseal the letter."
    m:
      - "Why would she write to Edmund? Couldn’t you just deliver the message orally? It probably has something to do with… I don’t know. I’ll be so grateful to you if you let me open that letter."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "  Madam, I had rather—"
    m:
      - "Ma’am, I’d rather—"

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "I know your lady does not love her husband."
      - "I am sure of that. And at her late being here"
      - "She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks"
      - "To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom."
    m:
      - "I know your lady Goneril doesn’t love her husband. I’m sure of that. And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances. I know she trusts you and tells you everything."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "I, madam?"
    m:
      - "Me, ma’am?"

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "I speak in understanding. Y’ are. I know ’t."
      - "Therefore I do advise you, take this note."
      - "My lord is dead. Edmund and I have talked,"
      - "And more convenient is he for my hand"
      - "Than for your lady’s. You may gather more."
      - "If you do find him, pray you give him this."
      - "And when your mistress hears thus much from you,"
      - "I pray desire her call her wisdom to her."
      - "So fare you well."
      - "If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,"
      - "Preferment falls on him that cuts him off."
    m:
      - "I know what I’m talking about. You’re close to her, I know it. So I recommend you take note of what I’m about to say. My husband is dead. Edmund and I have talked, and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril. You can figure out the rest. If you find him, please give him this. And when your mistress hears about all this, please tell her to use her head next time. So goodbye. If you happen to hear anything about that blind traitor Gloucester, I’ll reward anyone who snuffs him out."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "Would I could meet him, madam, I should show"
      - "What party I do follow."
    m:
      - "If I could run into him, ma’am, I’d prove which side I’m on."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "  Fare thee well."
    m:
      - "Goodbye."

  - os: "Exeunt severally"
    ms: "They exit in opposite directions."
