      - "*(reads aloud)*"
      - "“Caesar, beware of Brutus. Take heed of Cassius. Come not near Casca. Have an eye to Cinna. Trust not Trebonius. Mark well Metellus Cimber. Decius Brutus loves thee not. Thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal, look about you. Security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods defend thee!"
      - "    Thy lover,"
      - "    Artemidorus”"
      - "Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,"
      - "And as a suitor will I give him this."
      - "My heart laments that virtue cannot live"
      - "Out of the teeth of emulation."
      - "If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live."
      - "If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive."

      - "*(reading aloud from the letter)*"
      - "“Caesar, beware of Brutus. Watch Cassius. Don’t go near Casca. Keep an eye on Cinna. Don’t trust Trebonius. Pay attention to Metellus Cimber. Decius Brutus doesn’t love you. You’ve wronged Caius Ligarius. These men all have one intention, and it’s directed against Caesar. If you aren’t immortal, watch those around you. A sense of security opens the door to conspiracy. I pray that the mighty gods defend you!"
      - "    Your friend,"
      - "    Artemidorus.”"
      - "I’ll stand here until Caesar passes by, and I’ll give him this as though it’s a petition. My heart regrets that good men aren’t safe from the bite of jealous rivals. If you read this, Caesar, you might live. If not, the Fates are on the side of the traitors."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."
