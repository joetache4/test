<p>Oh, for two special reasons,</p>

<p>Lives almost by his looks, and for myself—</p>
<p>My virtue or my plague, be it either which—</p>
<p>She’s so conjunctive to my life and soul,</p>
<p>That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,</p>
<p>I could not but by her. The other motive</p>
<p>Why to a public count I might not go,</p>
<p>Is the great love the general gender bear him,</p>
<p>Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,</p>
<p>Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,</p>
<p>Convert his gyves to graces—so that my arrows,</p>
<p>Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind,</p>
<p>Would have reverted to my bow again,</p>
<p>And not where I had aimed them.</p>

<b>CLAUDIUS</b>
<p>Oh, for two main reasons which may seem weak to you, but strong to me. The queen, his mother, is devoted to him. And (for better or worse, whichever it is) she is such a part of my life and soul that I can’t live apart from her, any more than a planet can leave its orbit. The other reason why I couldn’t prosecute and arrest Hamlet is that the public loves him. In their affection they overlook all his faults. Like magic, they convert them into virtues, so whatever I said against him would end up hurting me, not him.</p>

<p>Not that I suspect you didn’t love your father, but I’ve seen it happen that, as the days go by, time dampens the flame of love. The fire of love always burns itself out, and nothing stays the way it began. Even a good thing can grow too big and die from its own excess. We should do what we intend to do right when we intend it, since our intentions are subject to as many weakenings and delays as there are words in the dictionary and accidents in life. And then all our “woulds” and “shoulds” are nothing but hot air. But back to my point: Hamlet’s coming back. What proof will you offer—in action, not just words—that you’re your father’s son?</p>

<p>There’s a willow that leans over the brook, dangling its white leaves over the glassy water. Ophelia made wild wreaths out of those leaves, braiding in crowflowers, thistles, daisies, and the orchises that vulgar shepherds have an obscene name for, but which pure-minded girls call “dead men’s fingers.” Climbing into the tree to hang the wreath of weeds on the hanging branches, she and her flowers fell into the gurgling brook. Her clothes spread out wide in the water, and buoyed her up for a while as she sang bits of old hymns, acting like someone who doesn’t realize the danger she’s in, or like someone completely accustomed to danger.

<p>Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,</p>
<p>And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet</p>
<p>It is our trick. Nature her custom holds,</p>
<p>Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,</p>
<p>The woman will be out.—Adieu, my lord.</p>
<p>I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze,</p>
<p>But that this folly doubts it.</p>

<p>You’ve had too much water already, poor Ophelia, so I won’t shed watery tears for you. But crying is what humans do. We do what’s in our nature, even if we’re ashamed of it. After I stop crying I’ll be through acting like a woman. Good-bye, my lord. I have some fiery words I could speak now, but my foolish tears are drowning them out.</p>
