<p>I’m sorry, my friend. The duke always gets it his way, and everyone knows you can’t budge him once he’s made up his mind. I’ll try talking to him again.</p>

<p>Pray you do not, sir. I have watched and traveled hard.</p>
<p>Some time I shall sleep out. The rest I’ll whistle.</p>
<p>A good man’s fortune may grow out at heels.</p>
<p>Give you good morrow.</p>

<p>Please don’t, sir. I’ve been up for a long time and have done a lot of traveling recently. This punishment will be a good chance to catch up on my sleep. The rest of the time I’ll whistle to entertain myself. Even good men have bad luck. Have a good morning.</p>

<p>It’s wrong for the duke to do this. The king will be angry with him.</p>

<p>Good King, that must approve the common saw,</p>
<p>Thou out of heaven’s benediction comest</p>
<p>To the warm sun.</p>
<p><em>(takes out a letter)</em></p>
<p>Approach, thou beacon to this underglobe,</p>
<p>That by thy comfortable beams I may</p>
<p>Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles</p>
<p>But misery. I know ’tis from Cordelia,</p>
<p>Who hath most fortunately been informed</p>
<p>Of my obscurèd course and <em>(reads the letter)</em> “shall find time</p>
<p>From this enormous state, seeking to give</p>
<p>Losses their remedies.” All weary and o’erwatched,</p>
<p>Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold</p>
<p>This shameful lodging.</p>
<p>Fortune, good night. Smile once more. Turn thy wheel.</p>
<p><em>(sleeps)</em></p>

<p>Oh, good King Lear, you’re proving that, just as they say, everything goes from good to bad. <em>(he takes out a letter)</em> Rise and shine, sun, so I can read this letter. Only those who are truly miserable see miracles. I know this letter is from Cordelia, who knows that I’m serving the king in disguise. <em>(looking at the letter)</em> She says that she will have time, now that she’s away from the monstrous conditions here, to find a way to fix things. I’m exhausted. I’ve been awake too long. This fatigue gives me an excuse to shut my eyes so I can’t see myself humiliated in the stocks. Good night, Lady Luck. Smile and spin your wheel of fortune again. <em>(he sleeps)</em></p>
