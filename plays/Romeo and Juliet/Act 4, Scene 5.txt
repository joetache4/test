      - "Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment."
    m:
      - "Be quiet, for shame! The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming. You had this child with the help of heaven. Now heaven has her. She is in a better place. You could not prevent her from dying someday, but heaven will give her eternal life. The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder—that was your idea of heaven. And now you cry, even though she has risen up above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? Oh, in this love, you love your child so badly, that you go mad, even though she is in heaven. It is best to marry well and die young, better than to be married for a long time. Dry up your tears, and put your rosemary on this beautiful corpse. And, in accordance with custom, carry her to the church in her best clothes. It’s natural for us to shed tears for her, but the truth is, we should be happy for her."

      - "Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,"
      - "And all things change them to the contrary."
    m:
      - "All the things that we prepared for the wedding party will now be used for the funeral. Our happy music will now be sad. Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast. Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches. Our bridal flowers will cover a buried corpse. And everything will be used for the opposite purpose from what we intended."

    o:
      - "Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him;"
      - "And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare"
      - "To follow this fair corse unto her grave."
      - "The heavens do lour upon you for some ill."
      - "Move them no more by crossing their high will."
    m:
      - "Sir, you go in. And, madam, go with him. And you go too, Sir Paris. Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave. The heavens hang threateningly over you for some past sin. Don’t disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven’s will."
