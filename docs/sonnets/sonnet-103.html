<p>Alack, what poverty my muse brings forth,</p>
<p>That having such a scope to show her pride,</p>
<p>The argument all bare is of more worth</p>
<p>Than when it hath my added praise beside!</p>
<p>O blame me not if I no more can write!</p>
<p>Look in your glass, and there appears a face</p>
<p>That overgoes my blunt invention quite,</p>
<p>Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.</p>
<p>Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,</p>
<p>To mar the subject that before was well?</p>
<p>For to no other pass my verses tend</p>
<p>Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;</p>
<p>And more, much more than in my verse can sit</p>
<p>Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.</p>

<p>Alas, I’m a poor poet, since even with such a great subject to write about (you), the subject is worth more by itself than with my praise added to it. Don’t blame me if I can’t write anymore! Look in the mirror, and you’ll see a face that quite overwhelms my limited poetic skills, making my lines stupid and thereby disgracing me. It would be a sin, wouldn’t it, if in trying to improve my poetry, I messed up their subject, which was perfectly fine before? For the only things I write about are your charms and your wonderful qualities, and your own mirror will show you far, far more of these than I can possibly fit into my poetry.</p>
