  - os: "Enter LADY MACBETH, alone, with a letter"
    ms: "LADY MACBETH enters, reading a letter."

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "*(reading)* “They met me in the day of success, and I have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king, who all-hailed me ’Thane of Cawdor,’ by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time with ’Hail, king that shalt be!’ This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”"
      - "Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be"
      - "What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature;"
      - "It is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness"
      - "To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great,"
      - "Art not without ambition, but without"
      - "The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,"
      - "That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,"
      - "And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou’ld’st have, great Glamis,"
      - "That which cries, “Thus thou must do,” if thou have it,"
      - "And that which rather thou dost fear to do,"
      - "Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,"
      - "That I may pour my spirits in thine ear"
      - "And chastise with the valor of my tongue"
      - "All that impedes thee from the golden round,"
      - "Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem"
      - "To have thee crowned withal."
    m:
      - "“The witches met me on the day of my victory in battle, and I have since learned that they have supernatural knowledge. When I tried desperately to question them further, they vanished into thin air. While I stood spellbound, messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor, which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me ’the future king!’ I thought I should tell you this news, my dearest partner in greatness, so that you could rejoice along with me about the greatness that is promised to us. Keep it secret, and farewell.” *(she looks up from the letter)* You are thane of Glamis and Cawdor, and you’re going to be king, just like you were promised. But I worry about whether or not you have what it takes to seize the crown. You are too full of the milk of human kindness to strike aggressively at your first opportunity. You want to be powerful, and you don’t lack ambition, but you don’t have the mean streak that these things call for. The things you want to do, you want to do like a good man. You don’t want to cheat, yet you want what doesn’t belong to you. There’s something you want, but you’re afraid to do what you need to do to get it. You want it to be done for you. Hurry home so I can persuade you and talk you out of whatever’s keeping you from going after the crown. After all, fate and witchcraft both seem to want you to be king."

  - os: "Enter SERVANT"
    ms: "A SERVANT enters."

  - o:
      - "What is your tidings?"
    m:
      - "What news do you bring?"

  - sp: SERVANT
    o:
      - "The king comes here tonight."
    m:
      - "The king is coming here tonight."

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "    Thou ’rt mad to say it."
      - "Is not thy master with him, who, were ’t so,"
      - "Would have informed for preparation?"
    m:
      - "You must be crazy to say that! Isn’t Macbeth with the king, and wouldn’t Macbeth have told me in advance so I could prepare, if the king were really coming?"

  - sp: SERVANT
    o:
      - "So please you, it is true: our thane is coming."
      - "One of my fellows had the speed of him,"
      - "Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more"
      - "Than would make up his message."
    m:
      - "I’m sorry, but it’s the truth. Macbeth is coming. He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message."

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "Give him tending."
      - "He brings great news."
    m:
      - "Take good care of him. He brings great news."

  - os: "Exit SERVANT"
    ms: "The SERVANT exits."

  - o:
      - "The raven himself is hoarse"
      - "That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan"
      - "Under my battlements. Come, you spirits"
      - "That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,"
      - "And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full"
      - "Of direst cruelty. Make thick my blood."
      - "Stop up the access and passage to remorse,"
      - "That no compunctious visitings of nature"
      - "Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between"
      - "The effect and it! Come to my woman’s breasts,"
      - "And take my milk for gall, you murd’ring ministers,"
      - "Wherever in your sightless substances"
      - "You wait on nature’s mischief. Come, thick night,"
      - "And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,"
      - "That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,"
      - "Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark"
      - "To cry “Hold, hold!”"
    m:
      - "So the messenger is short of breath, like a hoarse raven, as he announces Duncan’s entrance into my fortress, where he will die. Come, you spirits that asist murderous thoughts, make me less like a woman and more like a man, and fill me from head to toe with deadly cruelty! Thicken my blood and clog up my veins so I won’t feel remorse, so that no human compassion can stop my evil plan or prevent me from accomplishing it! Come to my female breast and turn my mother’s milk into poisonous acid, you murdering demons, wherever you hide, invisible and waiting to do evil! Come, thick night, and cover the world in the darkest smoke of hell, so that my sharp knife can’t see the wound it cuts open, and so heaven can’t peep through the darkness and cry, “No! Stop!”"

  - os: "Enter MACBETH"
    ms: "MACBETH enters."

  - o:
      - "Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor,"
      - "Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter,"
      - "Thy letters have transported me beyond"
      - "This ignorant present, and I feel now"
      - "The future in the instant."
    m:
      - "Great thane of Glamis! Worthy thane of Cawdor! You’ll soon be greater than both those titles, once you become king! Your letter has transported me from the present moment, when who knows what will happen, and has made me feel like the future is already here."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "    My dearest love,"
      - "Duncan comes here tonight."
    m:
      - "My dearest love, Duncan is coming here tonight."

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "    And when goes hence?"
    m:
      - "And when is he leaving?"

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "Tomorrow, as he purposes."
    m:
      - "He plans to leave tomorrow."

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "    O, never"
      - "Shall sun that morrow see!"
      - "Your face, my thane, is as a book where men"
      - "May read strange matters. To beguile the time,"
      - "Look like the time. Bear welcome in your eye,"
      - "Your hand, your tongue. Look like th’ innocent flower,"
      - "But be the serpent under ’t. He that’s coming"
      - "Must be provided for; and you shall put"
      - "This night’s great business into my dispatch,"
      - "Which shall to all our nights and days to come"
      - "Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom."
    m:
      - "That day will never come. Your face betrays strange feelings, my lord, and people will be able to read it like a book. In order to deceive them, you must appear the way they expect you to look. Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes, your hands, and your words. You should look like an innocent flower, but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower. The king is coming, and he’s got to be taken care of. Let me handle tonight’s preparations, because tonight will change every night and day for the rest of our lives."

  - sp: MACBETH
    o:
      - "We will speak further."
    m:
      - "We will speak about this further."

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "Only look up clear."
      - "To alter favor ever is to fear."
      - "Leave all the rest to me."
    m:
      - "You should project a peaceful mood, because if you look troubled, you will arouse suspicion. Leave all the rest to me."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
