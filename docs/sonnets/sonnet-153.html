<p>Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.</p>
<p>A maid of Dian’s this advantage found,</p>
<p>And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep</p>
<p>In a cold valley-fountain of that ground,</p>
<p>Which borrowed from this holy fire of love</p>
<p>A dateless lively heat, still to endure,</p>
<p>And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove</p>
<p>Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.</p>
<p>But at my mistress’ eye love’s brand new fired,</p>
<p>The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;</p>
<p>I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,</p>
<p>And thither hied, a sad distempered guest,</p>
<p>But found no cure; the bath for my help lies</p>
<p>Where Cupid got new fire—my mistress’ eye.</p>

<p>Cupid put down his torch and fell asleep. One of the nymphs who serve Diana took advantage of this situation and quickly plunged Cupid’s love-inducing flame in a nearby cold spring, which thus acquired a never-ending heat and became a bubbling hot bath that men still use to cure diseases. But at a glance from my mistress, Cupid’s torch fired up again, and Cupid decided to test whether his torch was working by touching my heart with it. I became sick with love and wanted the bath to ease my discomfort. I went to the spring as a sad, sick guest but found no cure. The only thing that could help me is the thing that gave Cupid his new fire: a glance from my mistress’ eye.</p>
