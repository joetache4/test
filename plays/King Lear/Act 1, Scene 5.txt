  - os: "Enter LEAR, KENT disguised, and FOOL"
    ms: "LEAR enters with KENT in disguise, and the FOOL."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "*(to KENT, giving him letters)* Go you before to Gloucester with these letters. Acquaint my daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you."
    m:
      - "*(to KENT, giving him letters)* Go ahead of us and deliver these letters to the Earl of Gloucester. Answer my daughter’s questions about the letter, but don’t tell her anything else you know. If you’re not quick enough, I’ll get there before you."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter."
    m:
      - "I won’t sleep until I’ve delivered your letter, my lord."

  - os: "Exit KENT"
    ms: "KENT exits."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "If a man’s brains were in ’s heels, were ’t not in danger of kibes?"
    m:
      - "If a man’s brain were in his feet, wouldn’t it be susceptible to frostbite?"

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Ay, boy."
    m:
      - "Yes, boy."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Then, I prithee, be merry. Thy wit shall ne’er go slipshod."
    m:
      - "In that case, cheer up. Your brains won’t need slippers to protect them from frostbite, since your brains aren’t in your feet—if they were you wouldn’t take this useless journey to see Regan."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Ha, ha, ha!"
    m:
      - "Ha, ha, ha!"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly. For though she’s as like this as a crab’s like an apple, yet I can tell what I can tell."
    m:
      - "Your other daughter Regan will treat you kindly, you’ll see. Even though she’s as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another, still… I know what I know."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?"
    m:
      - "And what do you know, boy?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou canst tell why one’s nose stands i’ th’ middle on ’s face?"
    m:
      - "I know that Regan will taste just like Goneril—both of them sour crabapples. Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person’s face?"

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "No."
    m:
      - "No."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Why, to keep one’s eyes of either side ’s nose, that what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into."
    m:
      - "Why, to keep the eyes on the sides, so that you can see anything that you can’t sniff out."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "I did her wrong—"
    m:
      - "I was wrong to her—"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?"
    m:
      - "Do you know how an oyster makes its shell?"

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "No."
    m:
      - "No."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Nor I neither. But I can tell why a snail has a house."
    m:
      - "Me neither. But I know why a snail carries its house on its back."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Why?"
    m:
      - "Why?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Why, to put ’s head in—not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case."
    m:
      - "So that he always has a roof over his head. He can’t give his house away to his daughters, leaving himself without shelter."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "I will forget my nature. So kind a father!—Be my horses ready?"
    m:
      - "I want to forget what I am. Such a kind father!—Are my horses ready?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Thy asses are gone about ’em. The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason."
    m:
      - "Your attendant asses are getting the horses ready. There’s a nice reason why the constellation Pleiades has only seven stars in it."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Because they are not eight?"
    m:
      - "Because it doesn’t have eight?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Yes indeed. Thou wouldst make a good fool."
    m:
      - "That’s right. You’d make a good fool."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "To take ’t again perforce— Monster ingratitude!"
    m:
      - "I could take back my crown by force—What outrageous ingratitude!"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I’d have thee beaten for being old before thy time."
    m:
      - "If you were my fool, uncle, I’d have you beaten for getting old before your time."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "How’s that?"
    m:
      - "How’s that?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise."
    m:
      - "You’re not supposed to get old until you’re wise."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!"
      - "I would not be mad."
      - "Keep me in temper. I would not be mad."
    m:
      - "Oh, dear God, don’t let me go mad! Keep me balanced and sane. I don’t want to go mad."

      - "Ready, my lord."
    m:
      - "They’re ready, my lord."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "She that’s a maid now and laughs at my departure,"
      - "Shall not be a maid long unless things be cut shorter."
    m:
      - "*(speaking to the audience)* Any girl who laughs because I’m going with the king is too foolish to remain a virgin very long."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."
