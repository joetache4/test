  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "If but as well I other accents borrow,"
      - "That can my speech diffuse, my good intent"
      - "May carry through itself to that full issue"
      - "For which I razed my likeness. Now, banished Kent,"
      - "If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned,"
      - "So may it come thy master, whom thou lovest,"
      - "Shall find thee full of labors."
    m:
      - "If I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance, then I’ll be able to carry out my plan perfectly. I was banished, but hopefully I can serve the very king who condemned me. I love my master, and he’ll find me very hard-working."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?"
    m:
      - "What’s your profession? What do you want from me?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "I do profess to be no less than I seem—to serve him truly that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear judgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish."
    m:
      - "I profess that I’m as good as I seem—I’ll faithfully serve a master who trusts me, love those who are honest, talk with those who are wise and don’t talk too much. I’m God-fearing, I fight if I must, and I don’t eat fish."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "What art thou?"
    m:
      - "But who are you?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king."
    m:
      - "An honest guy who’s as poor as the king."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "If thou beest as poor for a subject as he’s for a king, thou’rt poor enough. What wouldst thou?"
    m:
      - "If you’re as poor a subject as he is a king, you definitely are poor. What do you want?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Service."
    m:
      - "To work as a servant."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Who wouldst thou serve?"

      - "You."

    o:
      - "Dost thou know me, fellow?"
    m:
      - "Do you know me?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "No, sir. But you have that in your countenance which I would fain call master."
    m:
      - "No, sir, but there’s something about your face that makes me want to serve you."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "What’s that?"

      - "What work can you do?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in. And the best of me is diligence."
    m:
      - "I can be discreet in honorable matters, ride a horse, run, tell a good story badly, and deliver a plain message bluntly. I’m good at everything that ordinary men can do. The best thing about me is that I’m hardworking."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "How old art thou?"
    m:
      - "How old are you?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on her for anything. I have years on my back forty- eight."
    m:
      - "Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well, but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason. I’m forty-eight."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Follow me. Thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.—Dinner, ho, dinner! Where’s my knave, my fool?—Go you, and call my fool hither."
    m:

    m:
      - "He says your daughter’s not feeling well, my lord."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Why came not the slave back to me when I called him."
    m:
      - "Why didn’t the jerk come back to me when I called him?"

  - sp: FIRST KNIGHT
    o:
      - "Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner he would not."
    m:
      - "Sir, he told me quite bluntly that he didn’t feel like it."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "He would not?"
    m:
      - "Didn’t feel like it?"

  - sp: FIRST KNIGHT
    o:
      - "My lord, I know not what the matter is, but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont. There’s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also, and your daughter."
    m:
      - "My lord, I don’t know what’s going on, but it seems to me that your highness isn’t being treated as politely as before. The servants, the duke, and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Ha! Sayest thou so?"
    m:
      - "Huh! Do you really mean that?"

  - sp: FIRST KNIGHT
    o:
      - "I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken—for my duty cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged."
    m:
      - "Please forgive me if I’m mistaken, my lord—but I can’t keep quiet when I think you’re being insulted."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception. I have perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of unkindness. I will look further into ’t. But where’s my fool? I have not seen him this two days."
    m:
      - "No, you’re just reminding me of something I’ve also noticed. I’ve felt neglected recently, but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind. I’ll look into it further. But where’s my fool? I haven’t seen him for two days."

  - sp: FIRST KNIGHT
    o:
      - "Since my young lady’s going into France, sir, the fool hath much pined away."
    m:
      - "Ever since Cordelia left for France, sir, the fool has been depressed."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "No more of that. I have noted it well. Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her."
    m:
      - "Let’s not talk about it. I’ve noticed it myself. Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her."

  - os: "Exit an attendant"
    ms: "An attendant exits."

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "“My lady’s father”? My lord’s knave, your whoreson dog!"
      - "You slave, you cur!"
    m:
      - "“The father of the lady of the house”? You scoundrel! You lowlife son-of-a-bitch! You dog, you peasant!"

  - sp: OSWALD
    o:
      - "I am none of these, my lord. I beseech your pardon."
    m:
      - "I’m sorry, sir, but I’m not any of those things."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?"
      - "*(he strikes OSWALD)*"

      - "Nor tripped neither, you base football player."
    m:
      - "*(tripping OSWALD)* Or tripped, you lowlife football player?"

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "*(to KENT)* I thank thee, fellow. Thou servest me, and I’ll love thee."
    m:
      - "*(to KENT)* Thank you, sir. You serve me well, and I’ll love you for it."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "*(to OSWALD)* Come, sir, arise, away! I’ll teach you differences. Away, away. If you will measure your lubber’s length again, tarry. But away, go to. Have you wisdom? So."
    m:
      - "*(to OSWALD)* Come on, sir, get up and get out of here! I’ll teach you to respect your betters. If you want me to trip you again, then stick around. If not, get going. Go on. Do you know what’s good for you? There you go."

  - os: "Exit OSWALD"
    ms: "OSWALD exits."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Let me hire him too.—Here’s my coxcomb."
      - "*(offers KENT his cap)*"
    m:
      - "Wait, let me hire him too.—Here’s my fool’s cap, a token of my gratitude. *(he offers KENT his cap)*"

    m:
      - "*(to KENT)* Guy, you’d better take my cap."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Why, Fool?"
    m:
      - "Why, Fool?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Why? For taking one’s part that’s out of favor. Nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou’lt catch cold shortly. There, take my coxcomb. Why, this fellow has banished two on ’s daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.—How now, nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters."
    m:
      - "Why? For standing up for this unpopular king. No, if you can’t adjust to political changes, you’ll suffer for it. There, take my fool’s cap. This guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to. If you work for him, you’re a fool and should wear a fool’s cap.—So how’s it going, uncle? I wish I had two fool’s caps and two daughters."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Why, my boy?"
    m:
      - "Why, my boy?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "If I gave them all my living, I’d keep my coxcombs myself."
      - "There’s mine. Beg another of thy daughters."
    m:
      - "If I gave them all I own, I’d have two fool’s caps for myself. Here’s mine. Ask your daughters for another one."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Take heed, sirrah—the whip."
    m:
      - "Watch out, boy—remember I can whip you."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Truth’s a dog that must to kennel. He must be whipped out, when Lady Brach may stand by th’ fire and stink."
    m:
      - "I get whipped like a dog for telling the truth, while Lady Bitch gets to stand around the fire and stink the place up with her false words."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "A pestilent gall to me!"
    m:
      - "A constant pain to me!"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Sirrah, I’ll teach thee a speech."
    m:
      - "I’ll recite something for you, guy."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Do."

      - "Leave behind your booze and your whore,"
      - "And stay indoors,"
      - "And you’ll end up with more"
      - "Than two tens to a twenty."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "This is nothing, Fool."
    m:
      - "That makes no sense, Fool. It’s nothing."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer. You gave me nothing for ’t.—Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?"
    m:
      - "In that case it’s like the words of an unpaid lawyer. You paid me nothing for it. Can’t you make any use of nothing, uncle?"

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Why no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing."
    m:
      - "Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "*(to KENT)* Prithee, tell him so much the rent of his land comes to. He will not believe a fool."
    m:
      - "*(to KENT)* Please tell him that his income is nothing, now that he’s given his lands away. He won’t believe a fool."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "A bitter fool."
    m:

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "No, lad. Teach me."
    m:
      - "No, son. Tell me."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "Dost thou call me fool, boy?"
    m:
      - "Are you calling me a fool, boy?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "All thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with."
    m:
      - "Well, you’ve given away all your other rightful titles. The title of “fool” is the only one left."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "This is not altogether fool, my lord."
    m:
      - "This isn’t entirely a joke, your highness."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "No, faith, lords and great men will not let me. If I had a monopoly out, they would have part on ’t. And ladies too— they will not let me have all fool to myself; they’ll be snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I’ll give thee two crowns."
    m:
      - "No. I wish I could be a complete joker—but so many lords and important men are also playing fools that I can’t have a monopoly on it. Ladies too—they’re always snatching away my role as the biggest fool.—Uncle, give me an egg, and I’ll give you two crowns."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "What two crowns shall they be?"
    m:
      - "Which two crowns would those be?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Why—after I have cut the egg i’ th’ middle and eat up the meat—the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i’ th’ middle, and gavest away both parts, thou borest thy ass o’ th’ back o’er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipped that first finds it so."
      - "*(sings)*"
      - "*Fools had ne’er less wit in a year,*"
      - "*For wise men are grown foppish.*"
      - "*They know not how their wits to wear,*"
      - "*Their manners are so apish.*"
    m:
      - "Well, when I cut the egg in half and eat the whites, the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns. When you cut your own crown and kingdom in half and gave away both parts, you were as foolish as the old man in the old story who carries his donkey on his back instead of letting the donkey carry him. You didn’t have much brains inside the bald crown of your head when you gave away the gold crown of your kingdom. If I’m telling the truth like a fool in saying all this, whip the first person who thinks I sound foolish."
      - "*(he sings)*"
      - "*Fools have had a hard time this year.*"
      - "*They’ve been displaced by wise men who’ve grown foolish.*"
      - "*These men no longer know how to use their brains,*"
      - "*And they don’t know how to behave except by foolishly imitating others.*"

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?"
    m:
      - "When did you become so fond of singing, boy?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers. For when thou gavest them the rod, and put’st down thine own breeches,"
      - "*(sings)*"
      - "*Then they for sudden joy did weep*"
      - "*And I for sorrow sung,*"
      - "*That such a king should play bo-peep*"
      - "*And go the fools among.*"
      - "Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie. I would fain learn to lie."
    m:
      - "I’ve been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power. That’s when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down,"
      - "*(he sings)*"
      - "*Then your daughters wept for joy,*"
      - "*And I sang in sadness,*"
      - "*Seeing such a king become*"
      - "*A child and a fool.*"
      - "Please, uncle, hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie. I want to learn how to lie."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "An you lie, sirrah, we’ll have you whipped."
    m:
      - "If you lie, boy, we’ll have you whipped."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They’ll have me whipped for speaking true, thou’lt have me whipped for lying, and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any kind o’ thing than a fool. And yet I would not be thee, nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o’ both sides and left nothing i’ th’ middle. Here comes one o’ the parings."
    m:
      - "I’m amazed how similar you and your daughters are. They want to whip me for telling the truth, you want to whip me for lying, and sometimes I’m even whipped for keeping quiet. I’d rather be anything besides a fool. And yet I wouldn’t want to be you, uncle. When you gave away pieces of your kingdom, it’s as if you cut off pieces on both sides of your brain and left nothing in the middle. Here comes the owner of one piece."

  - os: "Enter GONERIL"
    ms: "GONERIL enters."

  - sp: LEAR
    o:
      - "How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on?"
      - "Methinks you are too much of late i’ th’ frown."
    m:
      - "What’s going on, daughter? Why are you frowning like that? I think you’ve been frowning too much recently."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "*(to LEAR)* Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am better than thou art now. I am a fool. Thou art nothing."
      - "*(to GONERIL)* Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your face bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,"
      - "He that keeps nor crust nor crumb,"
      - "Weary of all, shall want some."

If that’s true, it’s shameful. I realize that restraining your knights will damage your reputation with them—and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre.
