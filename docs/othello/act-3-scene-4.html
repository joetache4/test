<p>That’s not good. An Egyptian woman gave that handkerchief to my mother. She was a witch, and she could almost read people’s thoughts. She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her, my father would love and desire her. But if she lost it or gave it away, my father would start hating her and looking at other women. When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married. I did. So pay attention. Treat it as something precious. Losing it or giving it away would be an unspeakable loss, a loss like none other.</p>

<p>Something, sure, of state,</p>

<p>Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,</p>

<p>Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things,</p>

<p>Our other healthful members even to that sense</p>
<p>Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,</p>
<p>Nor of them look for such observances</p>
<p>As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,</p>
<p>I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,</p>

<p>There must be some political news from Venice, or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood. Men always get angry about little things when they’re really worried about bigger ones. That’s the way it goes. When our finger hurts, it makes the rest of the body hurt too. We shouldn’t expect men to be perfect, or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday. Oh, Emilia, I’m so inexperienced that I thought he was being unkind, but actually I was judging him harshly.</p>
