  - os: "Enter HENRY, PRINCE of Wales, and Sir John FALSTAFF"
    ms: "HENRY, PRINCE of Wales and Sir John FALSTAFF enter."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?"
    m:
      - "Hal, what time is it, my boy?"

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? Unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping-houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-colored taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day."
    m:
      - "You are so wasted from drinking booze and loosening your pants after lunch and sleeping on benches all afternoon that you don’t even remember how to ask for what you really want to know. What the hell does it matter to you what time it is? Unless hours were glasses of wine, minutes were chickens, clocks were whores’ tongues, sundials were whorehouse signs and the sun itself were a hot woman in a flame-colored dress, I don’t see any reason why you would need to know the time."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus, he,that wand’ring knight so fair. And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as God save thy Grace—Majesty, I should say, for grace thou wilt have none—"
    m:
      - "Now you’re talking, Hal. Thieves like us operate at night, by the moon and stars, and not by the sun. I hope, pretty boy, that when you become king, God save your Grace—or maybe I should just call you “Your Majesty,” since you don’t have any grace—"

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "What, none?"
    m:
      - "None?"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and butter."
    m:
      - "No, I swear. Not even enough to say grace before a snack."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Well, how then? Come, roundly, roundly."
    m:
      - "Come on, out with it. Get to the point."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires of the night’s body be called thieves of the day’s beauty. Let us be Diana’s foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon, and let men say we be men of good government, being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal."
    m:
      - "Okay then, pretty boy. Whey you become king, don’t let those of us who work at night be blamed for wasting daylight by sleeping through it. Give us fancy names: “Servants of the Moon Goddess Diana;” “Gentlemen of Shadows;” “Lunar Laborers.” Make people admire us for being well behaved. After all, we’re governed by the same force that governs the tides—the pale and cool moon, who lights our way as we sneak around."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the fortune of us that are the moon’s men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is, by the moon. As for proof now: a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with swearing “Lay by” and spent with crying “Bring in”; now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder, and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows."
    m:
      - "Well said. And you’re right—our luck ebbs and flows like the tide, because, like the sea, we’re governed by the moon. I’ll prove it. Imagine a bag of gold, brilliantly swiped on a Monday night and extravagantly spent on a Tuesday morning. You snatch it, shouting, “Hand it off!” and spend it, calling, “Bring it on!” It’s like the gallows: one minute you’re at the bottom of the ladder—low tide. The next, you’re swinging from the top—high tide!"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?"
    m:
      - "By God that’s right, my boy! And by the way, isn’t the hostess of the tavern a delicious woman?"

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?"
    m:
      - "Sweet as honey from Hybla, you dirty old man. And isn’t a sheriff’s uniform a pretty durable outfit?"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "How now, how now, mad wag? What, in thy quips and thy quiddities? What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?"
    m:
      - "What’s that supposed to mean, you crazy man? You’re in the mood for jokes? Why are you talking to me about a sheriff’s uniform?"

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?"
    m:
      - "Well, why the hell are you asking me about the hostess of the tavern?"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft."
    m:
      - "You’ve asked her for the bill enough times."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?"
    m:
      - "Did I ever ask you to pay for any of it?"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "No, I’ll give thee thy due. Thou hast paid all there."
    m:
      - "No. I’ve got to admit, you’ve settled with her all by yourself."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch, and where it would not, I have used my credit."
    m:
      - "And not just with her, but wherever my cash was good. And when I ran out, I switched to credit."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent—But I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king? And resolution thus fubbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father Antic the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief."
    m:
      - "And you’ve stretched that so far that if it weren’t “here apparent” that you’re the “heir apparent,” your credit wouldn’t be worth a thing. But listen, pretty boy. Will England still have hangmen when you’re king? And will a thief’s courage still be thwarted by that nasty old clown, the law? When you’re king, don’t hang thieves."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "No, thou shalt."
    m:
      - "No. You will."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I’ll be a brave judge."
    m:
      - "I will? Excellent! By God, I’ll be a great judge."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Thou judgest false already: I mean thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves, and so become a rare hangman."
    m:
      - "You’ve judged wrong already. I mean, you’ll be in charge of hanging thieves, and become a superb hangman."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my humor as well as waiting in the court, I can tell you."
    m:
      - "All right, Hal. I’ll tell you this: in a way, being a hangman agrees with me just as well as hanging around the court."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "For obtaining of suits?"
    m:
      - "Waiting to get your suits granted?"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe. ’Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear."
    m:
      - "Exactly. I’ve got plenty of those, just like the hangman has plenty of suits—the suits he takes off the dead men he hangs.—Damn, I’m as depressed as a tomcat or a dancing bear in chains."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Or an old lion, or a lover’s lute."
    m:
      - "Or an old lion, or a guitar playing a sad lovesong."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe."
    m:
      - "Or the wailing of a bagpipe."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of"
      - "Moorditch?"
    m:
      - "How about a rabbit, or a trip to Moorditch?"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Thou hast the most unsavory similes, and art indeed the most comparative, rascaliest, sweet young Prince. But, Hal, I comparative, rascaliest, sweet young Prince. But, Hal, I prithee trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of the council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and yet he talked wisely, and in the street, too."
    m:
      - "You have a knack for foul images. You are the most metaphorical and rascally, sweet young Prince. But Hal, please stop corrupting me with frivolous matters. I wish to God that you and I knew where we could buy a supply of good reputations. The other day, an elderly lord on the King’s Council came up to me in the street and lectured me about you, but I didn’t pay any attention. He spoke wisely, but I ignored him. But he made sense, and in the street, too."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the streets and no man regards it."
    m:
      - "You did well. You know the scripture: “Wisdom cries out in the street but no man listens.”"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal, God forgive thee for it. Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over. By the Lord, an I do not, I am a villain. I’ll be damned for never a king’s son in Christendom."
    m:
      - "Oh, you have a wicked talent for wrongly quoting scripture, you really could corrupt a saint. You’ve deeply harmed me, Hal, and God forgive you for it! Before I met you, I was innocent. And now, if I can speak truly, I’m no better than a sinner. I’ve got to change my life, and I will change my life, by God. If I don’t, I’m an evildoer. I won’t be damned, not for any king’s son in the universe."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?"
    m:
      - "Where should we go stealing tomorrow, Jack?"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Zounds, where thou wilt, lad. I’ll make one. An I do not, call me villain and baffle me."
    m:
      - "For God’s sake, wherever you want, boy. I’ll be one of the gang. If I’m not, call me evildoer and string me up."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying to purse-taking."
    m:
      - "I see you’ve changed your life, alright. From praying to pursesnatching."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Why, Hal, ’tis my vocation, Hal. ’Tis no sin for a man to labor in his vocation."
    m:
      - "It’s my calling, Hal. It’s no sin for a man to follow his calling."

  - os: "Enter POINS"
    ms: "POINS enters."

  - o:
      - "Poins!—Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried “Stand!” to a true man."
    m:
      - "Poins! Now we’ll find out whether Mr. Gadshill has planned a robbery. If good deeds bring a man to heaven, there’s no hell hot enough for Poins. This is the most incredible villain, whoever said “Stick ’em up!” to an honest man."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Good morrow, Ned."
    m:
      - "Morning, Ned."

  - sp: POINS
    o:
      - "Good morrow, sweet Hal.—What says Monsieur Remorse? What says Sir John Sack-and-Sugar? Jack, how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou soldest him on Good Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon’s leg?"
    m:
      - "Morning, sweet Hal. What’s Mr. Feelbad got to say? What’s going on, Sir John, Wino Jack? How’s your deal with the devil coming along? You sold him your soul last Good Friday for some cold chicken and a glass of cheap wine, right?"

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Sir John stands to his word. The devil shall have his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs. He will give the devil his due."
    m:
      - "The devil will get what’s coming to him. Sir John’s a man of his word, and he never disagrees with a proverb. He will “give the devil his due.”"

  - sp: POINS
    o:
      - "*(to FALSTAFF)* Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil."
    m:
      - "*(to FALSTAFF)* Then you’re damned for keeping your word with the devil."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Else he had been damned for cozening the devil."
    m:
      - "His only other choice is to be damned for cheating the devil."

  - sp: POINS
    o:
      - "But, my lads, my lads, tomorrow morning, by four o’clock, early at Gad’s Hill, there are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat purses. I have vizards for you all. You have horses for yourselves. Gadshill lies tonight in Rochester. I have bespoke supper tomorrow night in Eastcheap. We may do it as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns. If you will not, tarry at home and be hanged."
    m:
      - "But boys, boys! Four o’clock tomorrow morning some pilgrims are going to pass by Gad’s Hill. They’ll be on their way to Canterbury Cathedral with expensive offerings, and traders will be heading to London with bags of money. I’ve got masks for you, you’ve got horses for yourselves. Mr. Gadshill is spending tonight in Rochester, and I’ve already ordered tomorrow night’s dinner in Eastcheap. We could do this in our sleep. If you come, I’ll make you rich. If not, stay home and hang yourselves."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not, I’ll hang you for going."
    m:
      - "Listen, Yedward. If I stay home and don’t go, I’ll hang you — for going."

  - sp: POINS
    o:
      - "You will, chops?"
    m:
      - "You will, fatface?"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Hal, wilt thou make one?"
    m:
      - "Hal, are you in?"

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith."
    m:
      - "Who? Me, a robber? Me, a thief? Not me. No way."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "There’s neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee, nor thou cam’st not of the blood royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings."
    m:
      - "If you don’t dare to fight for ten shillings, there’s no honesty, manhood, or friendship in you, and you never came from royal blood."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Well then, once in my days I’ll be a madcap."
    m:
      - "Well, okay. For once in my life, I’ll be a little crazy."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Why, that’s well said."
    m:
      - "There you go."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Well, come what will, I’ll tarry at home."
    m:
      - "Well, you know what? I’ll stay home."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "By the Lord, I’ll be a traitor then when thou art king."
    m:
      - "By God, then I’ll be a traitor when you become king."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "I care not."
    m:
      - "I don’t care."

  - sp: POINS
    o:
      - "Sir John, I prithee, leave the Prince and me alone. I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go."
    m:
      - "Sir John, do me a favor: leave me and the Prince alone. I’ll spell out such good reasons for this adventure, he’s sure to join."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion, and him the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may move, and what he hears may be believed, that the true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false thief, for the poor abuses of the time want countenance. Farewell. You shall find me in Eastcheap."
    m:
      - "May God give you the power of persuasion and him the good sense to listen, so that what you say will affect him and what he hears will sink in. This way, the true prince will turn into false thief, just for laughs. After all, all the poor, little vices of the age need encouragement. So long; you’ll find me in Eastcheap."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Farewell, thou latter spring. Farewell, All-hallown summer."
    m:
      - "Farewell, you second spring! Farewell, you summer-in-November!"

  - os: "Exit FALSTAFF"
    ms: "FALSTAFF exits."

  - sp: POINS
    o:
      - "Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us tomorrow. I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff, Peto, Bardolph, and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid. Yourself and I will not be there. And when they have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head off from my shoulders."
    m:
      - "Now, my good sweet honey sir, come with us tomorrow. I have an idea for a practical joke, and I can’t do it by myself. Falstaff, Peto, Bardolph, and Mr. Gadshill will rob the travelers we’re planning to ambush, but you and I won’t be there. If you and I don’t rob them once they have the loot, then chop off my head!"

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "How shall we part with them in setting forth?"
    m:
      - "But we’re all planning to leave together. How will you and I separate ourselves?"

  - sp: POINS
    o:
      - "Why, we will set forth before or after them, and appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have no sooner achieved but we’ll set upon them."
    m:
      - "We’ll leave before them, or after them. We’ll tell them to meet us someplace, but then we won’t show up. They’ll pull off the robbery by themselves, and the second they’ve done it, we’ll attack them."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Yea, but ’tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits, and by every other appointment to be ourselves."
    m:
      - "Sure, but they’ll recognize our horses, our clothes, and all our other things."

  - sp: POINS
    o:
      - "Tut, our horses they shall not see; I’ll tie them in the wood. Our vizards we will change after we leave them. And, sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments."
    m:
      - "Psh! They won’t see our horses, because I’ll tie them in the forest. We’ll put on new masks after we leave them. And, just for this occasion, I’ve made cloaks out of rough buckram cloth, to cover our regular clothes."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us."
    m:
      - "Okay. But I’m afraid they’ll be too tough for us."

  - sp: POINS
    o:
      - "Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I’ll forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty at least he fought with, what wards, what blows, what extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this lies the jest."
    m:
      - "Well, I know that two of them are the biggest cowards who ever turned and ran. As for the third, if he fights even a second longer than is absolutely necessary, I promise to never fight again. The best part about this joke will be listening to the outlandish lies this fat clown will tell when we meet for dinner—how he fought at least thirty men, how he defended himself, how he got hit, what he endured. The funniest part will be when we call him on it."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "Well, I’ll go with thee. Provide us all things necessary and meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap. There I’ll sup. Farewell."
    m:
      - "Okay. I’ll go. Get everything together and meet me in Eastcheap tomorrow. I’ll eat there. Farewell."

  - sp: POINS
    o:
      - "Farewell, my lord."
    m:
      - "Farewell, my lord."

  - os: "Exit POINS"
    ms: "POINS exits."

  - sp: PRINCE HENRY
    o:
      - "I know you all, and will awhile uphold"
      - "The unyoked humor of your idleness."
      - "Yet herein will I imitate the sun,"
      - "Who doth permit the base contagious clouds"
      - "To smother up his beauty from the world,"
      - "That, when he please again to be himself,"
      - "Being wanted, he may be more wondered at"
      - "By breaking through the foul and ugly mist"
      - "Of vapors that did seem to strangle him."
      - "If all the year were playing holidays,"
      - "To sport would be as tedious as to work,"
      - "But when they seldom come, they wished for come,"
      - "And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents."
      - "So when this loose behavior I throw off"
      - "And pay the debt I never promisèd,"
      - "By how much better than my word I am,"
      - "By so much shall I falsify men’s hopes;"
      - "And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,"
      - "My reformation, glitt’ring o’er my fault,"
      - "Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes"
      - "Than that which hath no foil to set it off."
      - "I’ll so offend to make offense a skill,"
      - "Redeeming time when men think least I will."
    m:
      - "I understand all of you. For now, I’ll put on the rowdy behavior of your good-for-nothing ways. But in this way, I’ll be like the sun, who allows the vulgar, corrupting clouds to hide his beauty from the world. Then, when the sun wants to be himself again, he breaks through the foul mists and vapors that seemed to be strangling him. And because people have missed him so much, they are that much more impressed when he finally appears. If every day were a vacation, playing would grow as tedious as working. But when it’s rare, it’s looked forward to. Nothing is as precious as the unexpected occurrence. So when I throw off this wild behavior and accept the responsibilities of being king—a destiny I didn’t choose but was born into—I’ll suddenly seem like a far better man. In this way, I’ll give everyone the wrong expectation of me. Like a bright metal on a dark background, my reformation will shine even more brilliantly when it’s set against my wicked past. I’ll be so wild, I’ll make wildness an art form, then redeem myself when the world least expects me to."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."
