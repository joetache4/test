  - os: "Music plays. Enter two or three SERVANTS with a banquet"
    ms: "Music plays. Two or three SERVANTS enter with a feast."

  - sp: FIRST SERVANT
    o:
      - "Here they’ll be, man. Some o’ their plants are ill-rooted already. The least wind i’ th’ world will blow them down."
    m:
      - "Here’s where they’ll end up, on the floor. Some of them are leaning already. It won’t take much for them to fall over."

  - sp: SECOND SERVANT
    o:
      - "Lepidus is high-colored."
    m:
      - "Lepidus is red in the face."

  - sp: FIRST SERVANT
    o:
      - "They have made him drink alms-drink."
    m:
      - "They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor."

  - sp: SECOND SERVANT
    o:
      - "As they pinch one another by the disposition, he cries out, “No more,” reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to th’ drink."
    m:
      - "Their various personalities grate on one another. Lepidus cries, “No more arguing!” and then when they agree he resigns himself to drink."

  - sp: FIRST SERVANT
    o:
      - "But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion."
    m:
      - "Which goes on to impede his judgment."

  - sp: SECOND SERVANT
    o:
      - "Why, this it is to have a name in great men’s fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave."
    m:
      - "That’s what happens when you partner with great men but lack their power. I’d rather carry a reed that obviously can’t protect me than a sword I cannot lift."

  - sp: FIRST SERVANT
    o:
      - "To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in ’t, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks."
    m:
      - "To be so unimportant in the company of important men is like having a face without any eyes."

  - os: "A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, POMPEY, LEPIDUS, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, ENOBARBUS, and MENAS, with other captains and a BOY"
    ms: "A trumpet call sounds. CAESAR, ANTONY, POMPEY, LEPIDUS, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, ENOBARBUS, and MENAS enter, along with other captains and a BOY."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o’ th’ Nile"
      - "By certain scales i’ th’ Pyramid. They know"
      - "By th’ height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth"
      - "Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells"
      - "The more it promises. As it ebbs, the seedsman"
      - "Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,"
      - "And shortly comes to harvest."
    m:
      - "This is how they do it, sir: they measure the depth of the Nile, according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid. They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty. The higher the Nile flows, the better the harvest. As the river ebbs, the farmer scatters his seeds on the remaining silt. The harvest comes shortly after that."

  - sp: LEPIDUS
    o:
      - "You’ve strange serpents there?"
    m:
      - "Do you have unusual snakes there?"

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "Ay, Lepidus."
    m:
      - "Yes, Lepidus."

  - sp: LEPIDUS
    o:
      - "Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun. So is your crocodile."
    m:
      - "The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud, just like the crocodile."

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "They are so."
    m:
      - "Yes, Lepidus."

    m:
      - "I don’t feel so well, but I won’t stop."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "Not till you have slept. I fear me you’ll be in till then."
    m:
      - "Not until you pass out. I’m afraid you’ll keep going until then."

  - sp: LEPIDUS
    o:
      - "Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies’ pyramises are very goodly things. Without contradiction I have heard that."
    m:
      - "No, I certainly won’t stop. I’ve heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid. Without doubt I’ve heard that."

      - "And hear me speak a word."
    m:

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:

    m:
      - "*(aside to MENAS)* Leave me alone awhile. Where’s the wine for Lepidus?"

  - sp: LEPIDUS
    o:
      - "What manner o’ thing is your crocodile?"
    m:
      - "What does a crocodile look like?"

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth. It is just so high as it is, and moves with its own organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and, the elements once out of it, it transmigrates."
    m:
      - "Sir, it’s shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width. It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs. It lives on what nourishes it, and when the four elements leave it, its soul moves into another body."

  - sp: LEPIDUS
    o:
      - "What color is it of?"
    m:
      - "What color is it?"

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:

    m:

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:

    m:
      - "*(aside to ANTONY)* Will that description satisfy him?"

  - sp: ANTONY
    o:
      - "*(aside to CAESAR)* With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very epicure."
    m:
      - "*(aside to CAESAR)* That last toast Pompey gave him will take care of him, unless he’s a raging glutton."

      - "Do as I bid you.—Where’s this cup I called for?"
    m:

    o:

      - "*(to the others)* Be jolly, lords."
    m:
      - "You’ve served me faithfully. What else can I say? *(to the others)* Be happy, lords!"

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That’s twice."
    m:
      - "Would you like to be king of the entire world? Now I’ve said it twice."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "How should that be?"
    m:
      - "How could that happen?"

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "But entertain it,"
      - "And, though thou think me poor, I am the man"
      - "Will give thee all the world."
    m:
      - "Just consider it. Though I seem poor, I am the man who will give you the world."

  - sp: POMPEY
    o:
      - "    Hast thou drunk well?"
    m:
      - "Are you drunk?"

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup."
      - "Thou art, if thou dar’st be, the earthly Jove."

      - "Is thine, if thou wilt ha ’t."
    m:
      - "No, Pompey, I haven’t had anything to drink. You can be the most powerful man on earth if you dare use your power. Both land and sea are yours if you will take them."

      - "And not have spoke on ’t! In me ’tis villainy,"
      - "In thee ’t had been good service. Thou must know,"
      - "’Tis not my profit that does lead mine honor;"
      - "Mine honor, it. Repent that e’er thy tongue"
      - "Hath so betrayed thine act. Being done unknown,"
      - "I should have found it afterwards well done,"
      - "But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink."
    m:
      - "Oh, you should have done it without telling me! For me to do such a thing would be dishonorable. For you to do it would be good service. You should know that to me, profit isn’t more important than honor, but the other way around. Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions. If you had acted without my knowledge, I would have approved your action later. But now I must condemn it. Give it up and go drink."

      - "Shall never find it more."
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* For this, I’ll never be faithful to your declining fortunes again. A person who wants something but won’t take it when it materializes won’t get the opportunity again."

  - sp: MENAS
    o:
      - "The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all,"
      - "That it might go on wheels!"
    m:
      - "Then a third of the world is drunk. I wish it were all drunk. Then everything would go more smoothly."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "Drink thou. Increase the reels."
    m:
      - "Drink up. Liven up the party."

      - "It’s monstrous labor when I wash my brain"
      - "And it grows fouler."
    m:
      - "I could do without another toast. It’s unnatural. I keep washing my brain with alcohol, and it keeps getting fouler and more muddled."

Noble lords, let’s say good night. We’ve all gotten red in the face. Even the strong Enobarbus isn’t immune to the effects of wine, and I’m tongue-tied myself. This wild party has almost turned us all into clowns. What more need I say? Good night. Good Antony, shake my hand."
