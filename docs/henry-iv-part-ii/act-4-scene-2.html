<p>I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus. I never knew</p>
<p>yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valor. Do you</p>
<p>think me a swallow, an arrow, or a bullet? Have I in my poor</p>
<p>and old motion the expedition of thought? I have speeded</p>
<p>hither with the very extremest inch of possibility. I have</p>
<p>foundered ninescore and odd posts, and here, travel-tainted</p>
<p>as I am, have in my pure and immaculate valor taken Sir</p>
<p>John Colevile of the Dale, a most furious knight and</p>
<p>valorous enemy. But what of that? He saw me and yielded,</p>
<p>that I may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,</p>
<p>“There, cousin, I came, saw, and overcame.”</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>FALSTAFF</b>
<p>I’m sorry to hear you say that: I never realized that brave behavior should be rewarded with scolding and admonishing. Do you think I’m a bird, or an arrow, or a bullet? With this old, broken-down body, do you think I can move as fast as thought? I’ve gotten here as fast as humanly possible. I’ve burned out more than 180 horses, and—even though I’m spent from all that travel—I’ve managed, with my extraordinary bravery, to capture Sir John Coleville of the Valley, a brave knight and terrible enemy. But so what? He simply saw me and surrendered. So I can say, just like Julius Caesar, that “I came, I saw, I conquered.”</p>

<b>FALSTAFF</b>
<p>I would you had but the wit; ’twere better than your</p>
<p>dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy</p>
<p>doth not love me, nor a man cannot make him laugh. But</p>
<p>that’s no marvel; he drinks no wine. There’s never none of</p>
<p>these demure boys come to any proof, for thin drink doth so</p>
<p>overcool their blood, and making many fish meals, that they</p>
<p>fall into a kind of male green-sickness, and then, when they</p>
<p>marry, they get wenches. They are generally fools and</p>
<p>cowards, which some of us should be too, but for</p>
<p>inflammation.</p>
<p>A good sherris sack hath a two-fold operation in it. It</p>
<p>ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and</p>
<p>dull and crury vapors which environ it, makes it</p>
<p>apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and</p>
<p>delectable shapes, which, delivered o’er to the voice, the</p>
<p>tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The</p>
<p>second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of</p>
<p>the blood, which, before cold and settled, left the liver white</p>
<p>and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice.</p>
<p>But the sherris warms it and makes it course from the</p>
<p>inwards to the parts’ extremes. It illumineth the face, which</p>
<p>as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little</p>
<p>kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and</p>
<p>inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart,</p>
<p>who, great and puffed up with this retinue, doth any deed of</p>
<p>courage, and this valor comes of sherris. So that skill in the</p>
<p>weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and</p>
<p>learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack</p>
<p>commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that</p>
<p>Prince Harry is valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally</p>
<p>inherit of his father he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land,</p>
<p>manured, husbanded, and tilled with excellent endeavor of</p>
<p>drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is</p>
<p>become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the</p>
<p>first human principle I would teach them should be to</p>
<p>forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>FALSTAFF</b>
<p>I wish you had the wit to accomplish that: it would be worth all your land. My goodness, this young, serious-minded boy doesn’t like me, and no one can make him laugh. But I guess that’s not surprising; after all, he doesn’t drink any wine. None of those prim boys ever amount to anything: weak beer and too many fish dinners makes their blood cool. They all turn anemic, like young girls. And then, when they finally get married, they can only father girls because they don’t have the stuff to produce sons. Non-drinkers are all generally fools and cowards. The rest of us would probably be the same way, except that we’re always drunk. A good sherry wine operates in two ways. First, it rises into the brain and dries out all the foolish, dull, clogged-up fogs that have gathered there. It makes the brain sharp, quick, and inventive; full of nimble, fiery, and beautiful ideas. The voice and tongue give birth to those ideas which, when they grow up, become excellent wit. The second power of good wine is the warming of the blood. Before wine, the blood is cold and sluggish, and this makes the liver—the organ of passion—chilly and pale. A chilly, pale liver is the sign of cowardice and faint-heartedness. But wine warms the blood, making it course from the inner organs to all the extremities. The blood brightens the face, and the rest of the body—which is like a little kingdom in itself—takes that brightening as a signal. Then the spirits of the blood and all the internal organs gather together behind their captain: the heart. The heart draws strength from these followers and, enlarged by them, can accomplish any courageous deed. This is the bravery that comes from wine. Without wine, skill in weaponry doesn’t matter. Wine is what sets that skill in motion. Education is nothing more than idle gold in the devil’s hands, until wine rouses it and puts it to good use. That’s how Prince Harry became valiant. He’s taken the cold blood he inherited from his father and—like unproductive farmland—he fertilized it, planted it, and cared for it, through the hard work of drinking vast amounts of good and potent wine. And so now, he’s become hot and courageous. If I had a thousand sons, the first rule of behavior I would teach them would be to avoid weak drinks, and get themselves addicted to wine.</p>
