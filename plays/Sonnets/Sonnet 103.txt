      - "Alack, what poverty my muse brings forth,"
      - "That having such a scope to show her pride,"
      - "The argument all bare is of more worth"
      - "Than when it hath my added praise beside!"
      - "O blame me not if I no more can write!"
      - "Look in your glass, and there appears a face"
      - "That overgoes my blunt invention quite,"
      - "Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace."
      - "Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,"
      - "To mar the subject that before was well?"
      - "For to no other pass my verses tend"
      - "Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;"
      - "  And more, much more than in my verse can sit"
      - "  Your own glass shows you, when you look in it."

      - "Alas, I’m a poor poet, since even with such a great subject to write about (you), the subject is worth more by itself than with my praise added to it. Don’t blame me if I can’t write anymore! Look in the mirror, and you’ll see a face that quite overwhelms my limited poetic skills, making my lines stupid and thereby disgracing me. It would be a sin, wouldn’t it, if in trying to improve my poetry, I messed up their subject, which was perfectly fine before? For the only things I write about are your charms and your wonderful qualities, and your own mirror will show you far, far more of these than I can possibly fit into my poetry."
