    ms: "MARIA and the FOOL enter."

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard. Make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate. Do it quickly. I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst."
    m:
      - "No, I’m telling you, put on this robe and beard. Make him think you’re Sir Topas the priest. Be quick. Meanwhile, I’ll get Sir Toby."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "MARIA exits."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Well, I’ll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in ’t, and I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown."
    m:
      - "Well, I’ll put it on and disguise myself. I wish I were the first person who ever told lies in a priest’s robe."

  - os: "FOOL puts on gown and beard"
    ms: "The FOOL puts on the robe and beard."

  - o:
      - "I am not tall enough to become the function well, nor lean enough to be thought a good student, but to be said an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter."
    m:
      - "I’m not tall enough to make a believable priest, or skinny enough to look like a good student. But if you’re an honest man and a good host, that’s almost as good as being moral and studious. Here come the conspirators."

  - os: "Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA"
    ms: "SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA enter."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "Jove bless thee, master Parson."
    m:
      - "God bless you, Mr. Priest."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Bonos dies, Sir Toby. For, as the old hermit of Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, “That that is is.” So I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson. For, what is “that” but “that,” and “is” but “is”?"
    m:
      - "Bonos dies, Sir Toby. As the old hermit of Prague, who couldn’t read or write, said very wittily to a niece of King Gorboduc, “Whatever is, is.” So since I’m Mr. Priest, I’m Mr. Priest. Because isn’t “that” “that,” and isn’t “is” “is”?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "To him, Sir Topas."
    m:
      - "Go to him, Sir Topas."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "*(disguising his voice)* What ho, I say! Peace in this prison!"
    m:
      - "*(disguising his voice)* Quiet down in this prison!"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "The knave counterfeits well. A good knave."
    m:
      - "The fool’s a good actor. A good fool."

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "*(from within)* Who calls there?"
    m:
      - "*(offstage)* Who’s shouting?"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic."
    m:
      - "I’m Sir Topas the priest. I’ve come to visit Malvolio the lunatic."

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady—"
    m:
      - "Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, please go find my lady Olivia—"

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Out, hyperbolical fiend! How vexest thou this man! Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?"
    m:
      - "Get out, demon! Why are you bothering this poor man! Can’t you talk about anything besides ladies?"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "*(aside)* Well said, Master Parson."
    m:
      - "*(to himself)* Well said, Mr. Priest."

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad. They have laid me here in hideous darkness."
    m:
      - "Sir Topas, nobody’s ever been as badly treated as I’ve been. Good Sir Topas, don’t believe I’m insane, They’ve shut me up here in horrible darkness."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy. Sayest thou that house is dark?"
    m:
      - "You should be ashamed of yourself, Satan, you liar! I’m being gentle with you, because I’m one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself. You call this house dark?"

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "As hell, Sir Topas."
    m:
      - "Dark as hell, Sir Topas."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony. And yet complainest thou of obstruction?"
    m:
      - "But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls, and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal. But you’re still complaining of darkness and a bad view?"

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this house is dark."
    m:
      - "I’m not insane, Sir Topas. I’m telling you, this house is dark."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Madman, thou errest. I say, there is no darkness but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog."
    m:
      - "You’re wrong, you madman. There’s no darkness except ignorance, and you’re more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog."

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark as hell. And I say, there was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you are. Make the trial of it in any constant question."
    m:
      - "I tell you, this house is as dark as ignorance. And I tell you, no man has ever been treated worse than me. I’m no more insane than you are, and I’ll prove it. Ask me any commonsense question."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?"
    m:
      - "What was the philosopher Pythagoras’ belief about wild birds?"

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird."
    m:
      - "That our grandmother’s soul could end up inhabiting a bird."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "What thinkest thou of his opinion?"
    m:
      - "What do you think of his belief?"

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion."
    m:
      - "I respect the soul very much, so I disagree with his belief."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness. Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well."
    m:
      - "Well then, goodbye. Stay in the dark. I’ll only admit that you’re sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother’s soul. Goodbye."

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "Sir Topas, Sir Topas!"
    m:
      - "Sir Topas, Sir Topas!"

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Nay, I am for all waters."
    m:
      - "I can do anything!"

  - sp: MARIA
    o:
      - "Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown."
      - "He sees thee not."
    m:
      - "You could’ve done this without your beard and gown. He couldn’t see you."

  - sp: SIR TOBY BELCH
    o:
      - "To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou findest him. I would we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I would he were, for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber."
    m:
      - "Now talk to him in your own voice, and tell me how he is. I wish this trick would be over. If we can find a convenient way to let him go, I want to do it. I’m in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn’t be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion. Come to my room later on."

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper. As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for ’t."
    m:
      - "Good fool, good jester, I’ll make it worth your while if you get me a candle, and a pen, ink and paper. You have my word as a gentleman that I’ll always be grateful to you."

    m:
      - "Poor man, how did you go insane?"

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I am as well in my wits, Fool, as thou art."
    m:
      - "Fool, no one has ever been as mistreated as I am. I’m completely sane, Fool. I’m as sane as you are."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "But as well? Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits than a fool."
    m:
      - "As sane as me? Then you really are insane, if you’re no saner than a fool."

  - sp: MALVOLIO
    o:
      - "They have here propertied me, keep me in darkness, send ministers to me—asses!—and do all they can to face me out of my wits."
    m:
      - "They treat me like garbage here. They keep me in darkness, and send idiotic priests to talk to me—those asses!—and do everything they can to insist I’m insane."

  - sp: FOOL
    o:
      - "Advise you what you say. The minister is here. *(in the voice of Sir Topas)* Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore! Endeavor thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain bibble-babble."

    o:
      - "I will help you to ’t. But tell me true, are you not mad indeed? Or do you but counterfeit?"
