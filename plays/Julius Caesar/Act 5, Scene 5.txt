  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "    Why this, Volumnius:"
      - "The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me"
      - "Two several times by night. At Sardis once,"
      - "And this last night here in Philippi fields."
      - "I know my hour is come."
    m:
      - "Just this, Volumnius. The ghost of Caesar has appeared to me at night twice. Once at Sardis and once last night, here in Philippi fields. I know that my hour has come."

  - os: "Low alarums"
    ms: "Faint sounds of battle."

  - o:
      - "It is more worthy to leap in ourselves"
      - "Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,"
      - "Thou know’st that we two went to school together."
      - "Even for that our love of old, I prithee,"
      - "Hold thou my sword hilts, whilst I run on it."
    m:
      - "It’s nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us. Good Volumnius, you know that we went to school together. For the sake of our old friendship, I ask you, hold my sword handle while I run on it."

  - sp: VOLUMNIUS
    o:
      - "That’s not an office for a friend, my lord."
    m:
      - "That’s not a job for a friend, my lord."

      - "Night hangs upon mine eyes. My bones would rest,"
      - "That have but labored to attain this hour."
    m:
      - "Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius. Strato, you’ve slept this whole time. Farewell to you too, Strato. Countrymen, my heart rejoices that in all my life I knew no men who were untrue to me. I’ll have glory in this losing day—more than Octavius and Mark Antony will gain by their foul conquest. So farewell, all, for my tongue has almost finished with its life. I can’t see ahead of me. My bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour."

      - "Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it."
      - "Hold then my sword and turn away thy face"
      - "While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?"
    m:
      - "I beg you, Strato, stay by me. You’re a man with a good reputation. Your life has had honor in it. Then, hold my sword and turn your face away while I run on it. Will you, Strato?"

  - sp: STRATO
    o:
      - "Give me your hand first."

  - sp: STRATO
    o:
      - "Free from the bondage you are in, Messala."
      - "The conquerors can but make a fire of him."
      - "For Brutus only overcame himself,"
      - "And no man else hath honor by his death."
    m:
      - "Free from the bondage you are in, Messala. The conquerors can only make a fire of him, because only Brutus triumphed over himself, and no other man gets to triumph in his death."

  - sp: LUCILLIUS

  - sp: MESSALA
    o:
      - "Octavius, then take him to follow thee,"
      - "That did the latest service to my master."
    m:
      - "Then take this man into your service, Octavius, for he did the final service to my master."
