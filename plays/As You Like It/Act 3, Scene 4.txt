  - os: "Enter ROSALIND and CELIA"
    ms: "ROSALIND and CELIA enter."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Never talk to me. I will weep."
    m:
      - "Don’t talk to me. I’m going to cry."

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man."
    m:
      - "Go ahead if you want, but remember that crying doesn’t suit a man."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "But have I not cause to weep?"
    m:
      - "But don’t I have good reason to cry?"

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "As good cause as one would desire. Therefore weep."
    m:
      - "As good a reason as any. So go ahead and cry."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "His very hair is of the dissembling color."
    m:
      - "I mean, his hair is even red—the same color as that lying Judas."

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "Something browner than Judas’. Marry, his kisses are"
      - "Judas’ own children."
    m:
      - "No, it’s a shade browner than Judas’—but his kisses are just like Judas’."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "I’ faith, his hair is of a good color."
    m:
      - "No, really, his hair is a nice color."

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "An excellent color. Your chestnut was ever the only color."
    m:
      - "A very good color, this chestnut."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread."
    m:
      - "His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest."

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of winter’s sisterhood kisses not more religiously. The very ice of chastity is in them."
    m:
      - "He must have bought a cast-iron pair of Diana’s lips: an elderly nun isn’t anymore devoted in her kissing than he is. His kiss is cold and chaste."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not?"
    m:
      - "But why would he promise to come visit me this morning and then not come?"

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him."
    m:
      - "Really, he’s a total liar."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Do you think so?"
    m:
      - "Do you think so?"

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "Yes, I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut."
    m:
      - "Yes. He’s not a pickpocket or a horse thief, but when it comes to truth in love, he’s as hollow as a cup or a nut hollowed out by a worm."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "Not true in love?"
    m:
      - "You think his feelings aren’t true?"

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in."
    m:
      - "Oh, I think they are—when he’s in love. But he’s not in love."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "You have heard him swear downright he was."
    m:
      - "But you heard him swear up and down that he was."

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "“Was” is not “is.” Besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster. They are both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the duke your father."
    m:
      - "He “was,” but that doesn’t mean he is anymore. Besides, the promises of a lover are as untrustworthy as a bartender handing you an inflated tab: they both swear to their lies. He’s staying in the forest with your father now."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him. He asked me of what parentage I was. I told him, of as good as he. So he laughed and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?"
    m:
      - "I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him. He asked me who my parents were, and I told him they were as good as he was. He laughed at that and let me go. But why are we talking about my father, when a man like Orlando exists?"

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "Oh, that’s a brave man. He writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover, as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose; but all’s brave that youth mounts and folly guides."
    m:
      - "Oh, sure, he’s a brave man! He writes brave poems, speaks brave words, makes brave promises, and then breaks them just as bravely. He’s like a cowardly jouster, who breaks his lance across his opponent’s shield, rather than directly against it. But everything’s brave that a young man does and foolishness leads."

  - os: "Enter CORIN"
    ms: "CORIN enters."

  - o:
      - "Who comes here?"
    m:
      - "Who’s coming here?"

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "Mistress and master, you have oft inquired"
      - "After the shepherd that complained of love,"
      - "Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,"
      - "Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess"
      - "That was his mistress."
    m:
      - "Mistress and master, you’ve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with, the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with."

  - sp: CELIA
    o:
      - "*(as Aliena)* Well, and what of him?"
    m:
      - "Yes, what about him?"

  - sp: CORIN
    o:
      - "If you will see a pageant truly played"
      - "Between the pale complexion of true love"
      - "And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,"
      - "Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,"
      - "If you will mark it."
    m:
      - "If you’d like to see a scene played out between a man growing pale with unrequited love and a woman glowing with scorn and proud disdain, come with me a short distance and you’ll witness it."

  - sp: ROSALIND
    o:
      - "*(aside to CELIA)*  O, come, let us remove."
      - "The sight of lovers feedeth those in love."
      - "—*(as Ganymede)* Bring us to this sight, and you shall say"
      - "I’ll prove a busy actor in their play."
    m:
      - "*(speaking so that only CELIAcan hear)* Come on, let’s go. The sight of lovers nourishes whoever else is in love. *(to CORIN)* Bring us to this little show, and I’ll take a part in their play."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They all exit."
