  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer."
      - "Th’ *Antoniad*, the Egyptian admiral,"
      - "With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder."
      - "To see ’t mine eyes are blasted."
    m:
      - "We’re ruined, ruined, ruined! I can’t watch any more. The Egyptian flagship, the *Antoniad,* followed by all sixty Egyptian ships, has turned and fled. It destroyed my eyes to look upon it."

  - sp: SCARUS

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "    What’s thy passion?"
    m:
      - "What’s wrong with you?"

  - sp: SCARUS
    o:
      - "The greater cantle of the world is lost"
      - "With very ignorance. We have kissed away"
      - "Kingdoms and provinces."
    m:
      - "We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness. We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "    How appears the fight?"
    m:
      - "How goes the battle?"

  - sp: SCARUS
    o:
      - "On our side like the tokened pestilence,"
      - "Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt—"
      - "Whom leprosy o’ertake!—i’ th’ midst o’ th’ fight,"
      - "When vantage like a pair of twins appeared"
      - "Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,"
      - "The breeze upon her, like a cow in June,"
      - "Hoists sails and flies."
    m:
      - "Our side shows all the signs of certain defeat, which appear like the symptomatic sores of the plague. Right in the middle of the fight, just when the battle could have gone either way—actually we had a slight advantage—that immoral Egyptian nag—May she die of leprosy!—suddenly became frightened, and turned her ships around and fled."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:

      - "Experience, manhood, honor, ne’er before"
      - "Did violate so itself."
    m:
      - "Once she had turned around, the noble Antony, ruined by love, hoisted his own sails and followed her like a lovesick duck. He left the battle at the most crucial point. I never saw such a shameful act. He betrayed his own experience, manhood, and honor."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "    Alack, alack!"
    m:
      - "Terrible. Terrible."

      - "Oh, he has given example for our flight"
      - "Most grossly by his own!"
    m:
      - "The battle on the sea is almost lost. If our general had been his old self, we would have won. Oh, with his sordid desertion, he sets the example for our own."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "Ay, are you thereabouts? Why then, good night indeed."
    m:
      - "Are you considering desertion, as well? Then everything must really be finished."

    ms: "He exits."

  - sp: ENOBARBUS
    o:
      - "    I’ll yet follow"
