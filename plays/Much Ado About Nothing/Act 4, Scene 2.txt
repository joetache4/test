      - "must call forth the watch that are their accusers."
    m:

      - "Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat perjury,"
      - "to call a prince’s brother villain."
    m:
      - "Write down that Prince John is a villain. Why, that’s flat-out perjury—to call a prince’s brother a villain."

  - sp: BORACHIO
    o:
      - "Master Constable—"
    m:
      - "Master Constable—"

  - sp: DOGBERRY
    o:

  - sp: SEXTON

    o:

      - "disgrace Hero before the whole assembly, and not marry"
      - "her."
    m:
      - "I heard that Count Claudio meant to disgrace Hero in front of the whole wedding party and refuse to marry her."

  - sp: DOGBERRY
    o:
      - "*(to BORACHIO)* O villain! Thou wilt be condemned into"
      - "everlasting redemption for this."
    m:

      - "is this morning secretly stolen away. Hero was in this"
      - "manner accused, in this very manner refused, and upon the"
      - "grief of this, suddenly died.—Master Constable, let these"
      - "men be bound and brought to Leonato’s. I will go before"
      - "and show him their examination."
    m:
      - "*(to CONRADE and BORACHIO)* You can’t deny this, gentlemen. This morning, Prince John secretly snuck out of Messina. Hero was accused exactly as the watchman described, and died on the spot from the grief. Master Constable, tie up these men and bring them to Leonato’s. I’ll get there first and tell him what we found out."

    m:
      - "Come on, let’s get them opinioned."

  - sp: VERGES
    o:
      - "Let them be in the hands—"
    m:
      - "Let them be in the hands—"

  - sp: CONRADE
    o:
      - "Off, coxcomb!"
    m:
      - "Get off me, you fool!"

  - sp: DOGBERRY
    o:
      - "God’s my life, where’s the Sexton? Let him write down the"
      - "Prince’s officer “coxcomb.” Come, bind them.—Thou"
      - "naughty varlet!"
    m:
      - "Honest to God, where’s the sexton? He should write down that the Prince’s officer was called a fool. Come on, tie them up. *(to CONRADE)* You’re a nasty little stinker!"

  - sp: CONRADE
    o:
      - "Away! You are an ass, you are an ass!"
    m:

      - "masters, remember that I am an ass, though it be not"
      - "written down, yet forget not that I am an ass.—No, thou"
      - "villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by"
      - "good witness. I am a wise fellow and, which is more, an"
      - "officer and, which is more, a householder and, which is"
      - "more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in Messina, and one"
      - "that knows the law, go to, and a rich fellow enough, go to,"
      - "and a fellow that hath had losses, and one that hath two"
      - "gowns and everything handsome about him.—Bring him"
      - "away.—Oh, that I had been writ down an ass!"
    m:
      - "How can you call me that? Don’t you suspect my office? Don’t you suspect my age? Oh, if only the sexton were here to write down that I’m an ass! Gentlemen, remember that I am an ass; even though it’s not written down, don’t forget that I’m an ass. Oh, you’re a rotten bastard, you are. I’m a wise man and, what’s more, I’m an officer of the law and, what’s more, I’m a householder and, what’s more, I’m as handsome a hunk of meat as any in Messina. And I know the law, damn you, and I’m rich enough, damn you, and I used to have more, but I still have two robes and lots of lovely things.—Take him away!—Oh, if only the sexton had recorded that I’m an ass!"
