<p>Into his ruin’d ears, and thus deliver:</p>

<p>And sends allegiance and true faith of heart</p>
<p>To his most royal person, hither come</p>

<b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b>
<p>Noble lords, approach the crude walls of this old castle and let the trumpets sound a signal to the king that we want to meet. Deliver this message: Henry Bolingbroke kneels before King Richard, kisses his hand, and offers his loyalty and true faith of heart. I come to lay my weapons and my power at his feet, as long as he repeals my banishment and freely gives back all my lands. If he won’t, I’ll use my power to rain his Englishmen’s blood on the summer’s dust. By kneeling submissively before him I’ll show how little I desire to drench his green lands in this way. Go, tell him, and meanwhile we’ll march here on the plain. Let’s march without the drums so that they can clearly see our excellent military equipment from the castle’s ruined roof. I think King Richard and I should meet in the same way that lightning and rain mix in the sky, producing thunder that rips it apart. If he’s the lightning, I’ll be the rain. He can rage, while I will yield and pour my waters on the earth. But only on the earth, not on him. March along, and notice how King Richard looks.</p>

Even if you think that, like you, everyone has put their souls in danger by turning away from me, and that I have no friends, you should know that God, my master, is gathering disease and agony in his clouds on my behalf. They will strike the unborn children of anyone who raises their hands against me and the glory of my crown. Tell Bolingbroke—for I think he’s standing over there—that every step he takes on my land is a dangerous act of treason. He has come to wage war against me. But ten thousand sons will die, faithful Englishman’s blood will stain the pastures, and peace will turn to anger before he ever gets the crown he seeks.</p>

<p>Uncle, give me your hands. No, dry your eyes. Tears show love, but do nothing to fix their cause.  Cousin, I am too young to be your father, even though you are old enough to inherit my kingdom. I’ll willingly give you what you want, because you’ve forced me to do it. So now you’ll go to London, cousin?</p>
