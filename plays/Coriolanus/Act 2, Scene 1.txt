  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Good or bad?"
    m:
      - "Good news or bad?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Not according to the prayer of the people, for they"
      - "love not Martius."
    m:
      - "Not the news people prayed for—they have no love for Martius."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the"
      - "noble Martius."
    m:
      - "Yes, to devour him, as the hungry citizens would love to devour the noble Martius."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "He’s a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear."
    m:
      - "Martius is like a lamb, a lamb that roars like a bear."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "He’s a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two"
      - "are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you."
    m:
      - "Martius is like a bear, a bear that lives like a lamb. You two have been around a long time, answer one question for me."

  - sp: BOTH
    o:
      - "Well, sir."
    m:
      - "What do you want to know, sir?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "In what enormity is Martius poor in, that you two"
      - "have not in abundance?"
    m:
      - "Tell me a quality that Martius lacks but that you two have in abundance."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "He’s poor in no one fault, but stored with all."
    m:
      - "He doesn’t have just one fault—he has every fault."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Especially in pride."

      - "Especially pride."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "And topping all others in boasting."
    m:
      - "And boasting, above all."

    o:
      - "This is strange now: do you two know how you are"
      - "censured here in the city, I mean of us o’ the"
      - "right-hand file? do you?"
    m:
      - "One thing is strange though. Do you two know how you are regarded by the nobles of the city? Do you?"

  - sp: BOTH
    o:
      - "Why, how are we censured?"
    m:
      - "How are we seen?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Because you talk of pride now,—will you not be angry?"
    m:
      - "Because you talk of pride now, won’t you get angry if I tell you?"

  - sp: BOTH
    o:
      - "Well, well, sir, well."
    m:
      - "No, not at all, sir."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Why, ’tis no great matter; for a very little thief of"
      - "occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:"
      - "give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at"
      - "your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a"
      - "pleasure to you in being so. You blame Martius for"
      - "being proud?"
    m:
      - "Well, it doesn’t take much. Even the slightest incident will cause you to lose your patience and let your disposition take over. You become angry at what you should have enjoyed, and your only enjoyment comes from being angry. And yet you blame Martius for being proud?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "We do it not alone, sir."
    m:
      - "We’re not alone in our opinion, sir."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "I know you can do very little alone; for your helps"
      - "are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous"
      - "single: your abilities are too infant-like for"
      - "doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you"
      - "could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,"
      - "and make but an interior survey of your good selves!"
      - "O that you could!"
    m:
      - "I know you can do very little alone. Without all the help you get, your actions would be totally insignificant. Your abilities aren’t strong enough for you to do much on your own. You talk of pride. If only you could see yourselves as you really are! I wish you could!"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "What then, sir?"
    m:
      - "And what if we could, sir?"

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,"
      - "proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as"
      - "any in Rome."
    m:
      - "You’d see that you are equal to all the other unqualified, proud, violent, testy government officials—in other words, fools—in Rome."

  - sp: SICINIUS
    o:
      - "Menenius, you are known well enough too."
    m:
      - "Menenius, you have a bad reputation, too."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that"
      - "loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying"
      - "Tiber in’t; said to be something imperfect in"
      - "favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like"
      - "upon too trivial motion; one that converses more"
      - "with the buttock of the night than with the forehead"
      - "of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my"
      - "malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as"
      - "you are—I cannot call you Lycurguses—if the drink"
      - "you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a"
      - "crooked face at it. I can’t say your worships have"
      - "delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in"
      - "compound with the major part of your syllables: and"
      - "though I must be content to bear with those that say"
      - "you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that"
      - "tell you you have good faces. If you see this in"
      - "the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known"
      - "well enough too? what barm can your bisson"
      - "conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be"
      - "known well enough too?"
    m:
      - "I’m known as a moody aristocrat, and one that loves a cup of hot wine not diluted by even a drop of water from the Tiber River. I’m said to be somewhat flawed as a judge because I’m hastily swayed by the first argument I hear. I’m quick to anger at the slightest disturbance. I stay up late at night and don’t rise early in the morning. I say whatever I think and express my anger when I speak. Meeting two statesmen such as yourselves—I cannot call you lawmakers—if I don’t like the drink you give me, I make a crooked face at it. I don’t think you deserve the respectful titles of your profession, when I find most of what you say to be asinine. And though I can tolerate those that say you are respectable, serious men, the ones who say you are honest are deadly liars. If you see these same qualities in me, doesn’t it make sense that I’m known for my bad qualities? What harm can your misperceptions do to my character, if I already have a bad reputation?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Come, sir, come, we know you well enough."
    m:
      - "That’s enough, sir. We know your reputation well."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You"
      - "are ambitious for poor knaves’ caps and legs: you"
      - "wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a"
      - "cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;"
      - "and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a"
      - "second day of audience. When you are hearing a"
      - "matter between party and party, if you chance to be"
      - "pinched with the colic, you make faces like"
      - "mummers; set up the bloody flag against all"
      - "patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,"
      - "dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled"
      - "by your hearing: all the peace you make in their"
      - "cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are"
      - "a pair of strange ones."
    m:
      - "You don’t know anything about me, or about yourselves. Your ambition is to have poor citizens take off their hats and bow down to you. You’ll waste a whole morning listening to a dispute over three pence between an orange vendor and a wine tap seller and then postpone settling the issue until the next day. When you’re hearing a matter between two parties, if you’re feeling the tiniest bit sick, you become very dramatic: you violently refuse to be patient and, demanding a chamber pot, dismiss the controversy, leaving it even more entangled as a result of your hearing it.  The only justice you show is in calling both parties scoundrels. You’re a pair of strange men."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Come, come, you are well understood to be a"
      - "perfecter giber for the table than a necessary"
      - "bencher in the Capitol."
    m:
      - "Come, come. You’re well known to be a better dinner-table conversationalist than a serious judge."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall"
      - "encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When"
      - "you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the"
      - "wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not"
      - "so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher’s"
      - "cushion, or to be entombed in an ass’ pack-"
      - "saddle. Yet you must be saying, Martius is proud;"
      - "who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors"
      - "since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the"
      - "best of ’em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to"
      - "your worships: more of your conversation would"
      - "infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly"
      - "plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you."
    m:
      - "Even our priests would become mockers if they encountered anyone as ridiculous as you. When you stay on topic, what you say isn’t worth the wagging of your beards. And your beards don’t even deserve the honorable burial of being stuffed in a seamstress’ cushion or being entombed in the pack saddle of a donkey. You say Martius is proud, but even guessing conservatively, he’s worth all your predecessors since Deucalion, who survived the flood, even though some of them may have been hangmen. Good evening to you both. To keep talking with you would infect my brain, since you are the herdsmen of the beastly common people. I must go."

      - "were she earthly, no nobler,—whither do you follow"
      - "your eyes so fast?"
    m:
      - "How are you, my dear noble ladies? You are like the moon on earth—what are you looking at?"

    m:

      - "at home for you."
    m:
      - "Look, here’s a letter from him. He sent another to the Senate and another to his wife. I think there’s one at home for you."

    o:
      - "I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for"
      - "me!"
    m:
      - "My household will be thrilled tonight. A letter for me!"

  - sp: VIRGILIA
    o:
      - "Yes, certain, there’s a letter for you; I saw’t."
    m:
      - "Yes, I’m certain there’s a letter for you. I saw it."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven"
      - "years’ health; in which time I will make a lip at"
      - "the physician: the most sovereign prescription in"
      - "Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,"
      - "of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he"
      - "not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded."
    m:
      - "A letter for me! It makes me live seven years longer, and all the while I’ll laugh at my doctor. The most well-established prescription according to the great doctor Galen is nothing but an experimental cure, and compared to this news, it’s worth no more than horse medicine. Is he wounded? He was likely to come home wounded."

  - sp: VIRGILIA
    o:
      - "O, no, no, no."
    m:
      - "Oh, no, no, no."

  - sp: MENENIUS
    o:
      - "So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a’"
      - "victory in his pocket? the wounds become him."
    m:
      - "As do I, if he’s not wounded too much. If he brings home victory, the wounds are appropriate."

    o:
      - "On’s brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home"
      - "with the oaken garland."
    m:

      - "fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold"
      - "that’s in them. Is the senate possessed of this?"
    m:
      - "It was Aufidius’ time to die. For all the chests in Corioles and the gold that’s in them, I bet that if Martius had captured him, he would’ve gotten the beating he deserved. Does the Senate know about this?"

  - sp: VOLUMNIA
    o:

Storefronts are boarded up, leaden roofs covered over and all different types of people are riding their horses on top of the roofs, all trying to see him. Priests who rarely come out in public are mixed in with the common people and struggle to find a place in the crowd. Women who usually wear veils are letting their pale cheeks get sunburned. There is such mayhem that it seems like whichever god is guiding Martius has taken over his very body and given him a godly way of being."
