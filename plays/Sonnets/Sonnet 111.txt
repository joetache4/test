      - "O for my sake do you with Fortune chide,"
      - "The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,"
      - "That did not better for my life provide"
      - "Than public means which public manners breeds."
      - "Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,"
      - "And almost thence my nature is subdued"
      - "To what it works in, like the dyer’s hand:"
      - "Pity me then, and wish I were renewed,"
      - "Whilst like a willing patient I will drink"
      - "Potions of eisel ’gainst my strong infection;"
      - "No bitterness that I will bitter think,"
      - "Nor double penance, to correct correction."
      - "  Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,"
      - "  Ev’n that your pity is enough to cure me."

      - "I know you curse my bad luck for having no better way to make a living than in front of the public, which has had a bad effect on my morals and behavior. This is why I have a bad name, and coming into contact with the public so much has polluted my very nature, just like a cloth-dyer’s hand becomes stained with his dye. So take pity on me and hope that I can go back to being the way I would have been if I hadn’t been contaminated by the public; meanwhile, I’ll drink bitter medicines made of vinegar to cure myself of this infection. I won’t think that the medicine’s bitter no matter how bitter it is, nor will I protest at having to do double penance to try to undo the bad influence. So pity me, dear friend, and I assure you: Your pity alone is enough to cure me."
