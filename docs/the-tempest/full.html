<p>My brother, your uncle Antonio—just listen to this (I still can’t believe a brother could be so disloyal!)—My brother whom—aside from you—I loved more than anyone else in the world, I trusted to run my state, which at that time was the strongest in the land, and Prospero the number one duke, famous for my dignity and my education. Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic, grammar, geometry, and astronomy, I let my control of the government slide a bit, being too wrapped up in my occult books. Your disloyal uncle—are you paying attention?</p>

With Antonio possessing such powers and wealth, coming not only from my income but also from his ability to take whatever my authority allowed him to take, Antonio started to believe that he was the duke, like some liar who begins to believe in his own lie.

<p>Indeed the top of admiration, worth</p>

<p>Th’ harmony of their tongues hath into bondage</p>
<p>Brought my too diligent ear. For several virtues</p>
<p>Have I liked several women. Never any</p>
<p>With so full soul but some defect in her</p>
<p>Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed</p>
<p>And put it to the foil. But you, O you,</p>

<p>Miranda—the very name means “admired!” You are indeed admired, more than anything else in the world! I’ve looked at many ladies with pleasure, and been seduced by the sweet nothings they said to me. I’ve liked several women for their good qualities, but there was something wrong with each one that blotted her excellent qualities and cancelled them out. But with you it’s different. You’re perfect, without a rival in the world, made up of the best qualities of every creature.</p>

<p>Just as I told you, he usually sleeps in the afternoon.

Just remember to grab his books first, since without them he’s just a poor fool like me, and can’t command a single spirit. All the spirits hate him as much as I do. Be sure to burn his magic books. He has some wonderful home furnishings—that’s what he calls them—that he’ll use to decorate his house when he gets one. The most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is. He says she has no equal. I never saw a woman except her and Sycorax, my mother.

I’ve driven you crazy, and many mad people are driven to kill themselves in desperation. <em>(some of the courtiers draw their swords)</em> Listen, you fools, my fellow harpies and I carry out Fate’s orders. Your swords are useless against us—you’d be more successful swinging them at the empty air, or stabbing at water, than trying to cut off even one of my feathers. My two companions are just as invulnerable as I am. Even if you had the power to hurt us, you’d find your swords far too heavy to lift. But remember—and it’s my job to remind you of this—that in Milan the three of you stole Prospero’s throne and threw him and his innocent child into the sea, which has now taken revenge on you. To punish you for this horrible crime, the higher powers—delaying their punishment, not forgetting about it—have stirred up the seas and all the creatures of earth against you.—They’ve taken your only son from you, Alonso, and they’ve ordered me to destroy you slowly, in a way worse than sudden death could ever be. I’ll stay with you every step of your way. The only way to protect yourselves from the angry higher powers—which are ready to fall upon your head on this empty island—is for you to be sincerely sorry in your hearts for what you’ve done, and to live innocent lives from this time forward.</p>

<p>I told you, sir, they were totally drunk, so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces, and beating the ground for touching their feet—yet even when drunk, they kept their plan firmly in mind. Then I beat my drum, at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes, looking around for the source of my music. I enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins. In the end I left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room, with the stinking water covering them up to their chins.</p>
