<p>Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,</p>
<p>With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts—</p>
<p>O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power</p>
<p>So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust</p>
<p>The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.</p>
<p>O Hamlet, what a falling off was there!</p>
<p>From me, whose love was of that dignity</p>
<p>That it went hand in hand even with the vow</p>
<p>I made to her in marriage, and to decline</p>
<p>Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor</p>
<p>To those of mine.</p>
<p>But virtue, as it never will be moved,</p>
<p>Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,</p>
<p>So lust, though to a radiant angel linked,</p>
<p>Will sate itself in a celestial bed</p>
<p>And prey on garbage.</p>
<p>But soft! Methinks I scent the morning air.</p>
<p>Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,</p>
<p>My custom always of the afternoon,</p>
<p>Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole</p>
<p>With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,</p>
<p>And in the porches of my ears did pour</p>
<p>The leperous distilment, whose effect</p>
<p>Holds such an enmity with blood of man</p>
<p>That swift as quicksilver it courses through</p>
<p>The natural gates and alleys of the body</p>
<p>And with a sudden vigor doth posset</p>
<p>And curd, like eager droppings into milk,</p>
<p>The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine.</p>
<p>And a most instant tetter barked about,</p>
<p>Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust</p>
<p>All my smooth body.</p>
<p>Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand</p>
<p>Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,</p>
<p>Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,</p>
<p>Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled.</p>
<p>No reckoning made, but sent to my account</p>
<p>With all my imperfections on my head.</p>
<p>Oh, horrible, oh, horrible, most horrible!</p>
<p>If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.</p>
<p>Let not the royal bed of Denmark be</p>
<p>A couch for luxury and damnèd incest.</p>
<p>But howsoever thou pursuest this act,</p>
<p>Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive</p>
<p>Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven</p>
<p>And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge</p>
<p>To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.</p>
<p>The glowworm shows the matin to be near,</p>
<p>And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire.</p>
<p>Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.</p>

<b>GHOST</b>
<p>Yes, that incestuous, adulterous animal. With his clever words and fancy gifts, he seduced my seemingly virtuous queen, persuading her to give in to his lust. They were evil words and gifts to seduce her like that! Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell! She went from me, who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage, to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine. But just as you can’t corrupt a truly virtuous person no matter how you try, the opposite is also true: a lustful person like her can satisfy herself in a heavenly union and then move on to garbage. But hang on, I think I smell the morning air. So let me be brief here. Your uncle snuck up to me while I was sleeping in the orchard, as I always used to do in the afternoon, and poured a vial of henbane poison into my ear—that poison that moves like quicksilver through the veins and curdles the blood, which is just what it did to me. I broke out in a scaly rash that covered my smooth body with a revolting crust. And that’s how my brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once. He cut me off in the middle of a sinful life. I had no chance to repent my sins or receive last rites. Oh, it’s horrible, horrible, so horrible! If you are human, don’t stand for it. Don’t let the Danish king’s bed be a nest of incest. But however you go about your revenge, don’t corrupt your mind or do any harm to your mother. Leave her to God and her own guilt. Now, good-bye. The glowworm’s light is beginning to fade, so morning is near. Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye. Remember me.</p>

<p>And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.</p>
<p>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</p>
<p>Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come,</p>
<p>Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,</p>
<p>How strange or odd soe’er I bear myself</p>
<p>(As I perchance hereafter shall think meet</p>
<p>To put an antic disposition on),</p>
<p>That you, at such times seeing me, never shall—</p>
<p>With arms encumbered thus, or this headshake,</p>
<p>Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,</p>
<p>As “Well, well, we know,” or “We could an if we would,”</p>
<p>Or “If we list to speak,” or “There be an if they might,”</p>
<p>Or such ambiguous giving out—to note</p>
<p>That you know aught of me. This not to do,</p>
<p>So grace and mercy at your most need help you,</p>
<p>Swear.</p>

<p>Then give it a nice welcome, as you would give to any stranger. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than you’ve even dreamed of. But now listen to me. No matter how strangely I act (since I may find it appropriate to act a little crazy in the near future), you must never, ever let on—with a gesture of your hands or a certain expression on your face—that you know anything about what happened to me here tonight. You must never say anything like, “Ah, yes, just as we suspected,” or “We could tell you a thing or two about him,” or anything like that. Swear you won’t.</p>

<p>Rest, rest, perturbèd spirit!—So, gentlemen,</p>
<p>With all my love I do commend me to you,</p>
<p>And what so poor a man as Hamlet is</p>
<p>May do, to express his love and friending to you,</p>
<p>God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,</p>
<p>And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.</p>

<p>Nay, come, let’s go together.</p>

<p>Okay, then, unhappy ghost, you can rest now. So, gentlemen, I thank you heartily and with all my love, and I’ll repay you however I can some day. Let’s go back to court together, but <em>shhh</em>, please. No talking about this. There is so much out of whack in these times. And damn the fact that I’m supposed to fix it! Come on, let’s go.</p>
