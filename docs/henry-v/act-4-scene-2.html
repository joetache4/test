<b>CONSTABLE</b>
<p>To our horses, you gallant princes. Let’s mount straight away. All we have to do is look at that poor starving army, and our wonderful display of strength will eat away their souls, leaving them the mere husk of men. There isn’t enough work out there to keep us all busy, and hardly enough blood in all their sickly veins put together to put a stain on each of our swords, which our French knights will take out and then put away again, with nothing to do. Let’s blow on them. The breath of our valor will send them sprawling. There’s no question, lords, but that those extra servants and peasants swarming uselessly around our battle formations would be sufficient to rid this field of such a good-for-nothing foe, while we ourselves stood at the base of this mountain idly looking on. But our honor wouldn’t stand for that. What’s there to say? Doing the very least will do the whole job. Let the trumpets sound the signal to mount up and march. Our advance will so dazzle the enemy that England will cower in fear and surrender.</p>

<p>Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?</p>
<p>Yond island carrions, desperate of their bones,</p>

<p>Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,</p>
<p>And our air shakes them passing scornfully.</p>
<p>Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host</p>
<p>And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps.</p>

<p>With torch staves in their hand, and their poor jades</p>
<p>Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,</p>
<p>The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes,</p>
<p>And in their pale dull mouths the gemeled bit</p>
<p>Lies foul with chawed grass, still and motionless.</p>
<p>And their executors, the knavish crows,</p>
<p>Fly o’er them all, impatient for their hour.</p>

<b>GRANDPRÉ</b>
<p>What are you waiting for, lords of France? Those island-bred skeletons, terrified for their bones, are an offensive sight on the morning field. Their ragged banners hang in shreds and the very air of France makes them shiver as it blows by. The god of war looks like a pathetic bankrupt in this miserable army, peeking timidly through a rusty visor. The horsemen stand frozen like candlesticks, torches in their hands. The poor horses droop their heads, their flanks and hips sagging, pus seeping from eyes as pale as death, and in their colorless mouths, the motionless bit is smeared with chewed grass. Meanwhile, their executors, malicious crows, fly over them, impatient for their moment. It’s beyond the power of words to describe an army so bereft of life.</p>
