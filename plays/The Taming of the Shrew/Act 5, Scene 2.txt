    o:
      - "At last, though long, our jarring notes agree,"
      - "And time it is when raging war is done"
      - "To smile at ’scapes and perils overblown."
      - "My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,"

      - "Finally, at long last, we’ve reconciled our differences. Now is the time—when war is safely over—to laugh at past dangers and adventures. My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome, while I with equal affection welcome yours. Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina, and you, Hortensio, with your loving widow, you’ll find no better entertainment anywhere. All of you are welcome in my house. This last course here is for closing up the stomach after great feasting. Now everyone be seated, as this is the part where we sit and chat as well as eat."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!"

  - sp: WIDOW
    o:
      - "Then never trust me if I be afeard."
    m:
      - "Me afraid of him? I don’t think so."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:"

    m:
      - "Conceives by me? How does that sit with you, Hortensio?"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "My widow says, thus she conceives her tale."
    m:

    o:
      - "A very mean meaning."

      - "A very nasty meaning."

  - sp: WIDOW
    o:

  - sp: GREMIO

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "Head and butt! An hasty-witted body"
      - "Would say your head and butt were head and horn."
    m:

  - sp: VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?"
    m:
      - "Ah, our bride has woken up!"

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "Ay, but not frighted me. Therefore I’ll sleep again."
    m:

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Nay, that you shall not. Since you have begun,"
      - "Have at you for a bitter jest or two!"
    m:
      - "No, you shall not. Since you chimed in, let’s see if we can trade a caustic joke or two."

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,"
      - "And then pursue me as you draw your bow.—"
      - "You are welcome all."
    m:

      - "This bird you aimed at, though you hit her not.—"
      - "Therefore a health to all that shot and missed."
    m:
      - "Well, she got away. Signior Tranio, you also took aim at that bird, though you didn’t hit her.—So here’s a health to all who’ve shot and missed."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "Oh, sir, Lucentio slipped me like his greyhound,"
      - "Which runs himself and catches for his master."
    m:
      - "Oh well, sir, I was really just like a greyhound that Lucentio let off the leash: I did the running, but the catch was his."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "A good swift simile, but something currish."
    m:
      - "A witty if a cynical reply."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "’Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself."
      - "’Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay."
    m:
      - "It’s good you hunted for yourself, sir. It’s rumored that your deer holds you at bay."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "Oh, Oh, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now."
    m:

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio."
    m:
      - "I thank you for that quip, good Tranio."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?"
    m:
      - "Fess up, fess up, didn’t that one strike home?"

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "He has a little galled me, I confess."
      - "And, as the jest did glance away from me,"
      - "’Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright."
    m:
      - "He’s made me a little sore, I’ll admit. But since the gibe glanced off me, ten to one it hit you both straight on."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,"
      - "I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all."
    m:
      - "Seriously, though, son Petruchio, I think you have the most thoroughgoing shrew of us all."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Well, I say no. And therefore, for assurance,"
      - "Let’s each one send unto his wife;"
      - "And he whose wife is most obedient"
      - "To come at first when he doth send for her,"
      - "Shall win the wager which we will propose."
    m:
      - "Well, I disagree. But why not put it to the test? Let’s each one send for his wife. Whichever’s is most obedient and comes most readily shall win the bet that we’ll propose."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Content. What’s the wager?"
    m:
      - "Agreed. What’s the bet?"

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "Twenty crowns."
    m:
      - "Twenty crowns."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Twenty crowns?"
      - "I’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound,"
      - "But twenty times so much upon my wife."
    m:
      - "Twenty crowns? That’s a bet I’d make on my hawk or my hound. I’d wager twenty times as much on my wife."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "A hundred then."
    m:
      - "A hundred then."

  - sp: HORTENSIO

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "I’ll have no halves. I’ll bear it all myself."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "How! “She’s busy, and she cannot come!”"
      - "Is that an answer?"
    m:
      - "What! “She’s busy and cannot come!” Is that an answer?"

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "Ay, and a kind one too."
      - "Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse."
    m:

      - "Nay, then she must needs come."
    m:
      - "Oh-ho, he *requests*! Why, then she’ll have to come."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "I am afraid, sir,"
      - "Do what you can, yours will not be entreated."
    m:

      - "And awful rule, and right supremacy,"
      - "And, to be short, what not that’s sweet and happy?"
    m:
      - "I’ll tell you what it means. It means peace and love and a quiet life, supremacy based on reverence and profound respect, and—not to go on and on about it—everything that’s sweet and happy."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "Now, fair befall thee, good Petruchio!"
      - "The wager thou hast won, and I will add"

      - "For she is changed as she had never been."
    m:
      - "May good fortune come to you, good Petruchio! You’ve won the wager, and I will add twenty thousand crowns to what they owe you. Another dowry for another wife, for, truly, she is so transformed she’s like a completely new woman."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Nay, I will win my wager better yet,"
      - "And show more sign of her obedience,"

    o:
      - "Fie, fie! Unknit that threat’ning unkind brow"
      - "And dart not scornful glances from those eyes"
      - "To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor."
      - "It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,"
      - "Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,"
      - "And in no sense is meet or amiable."
      - "A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,"
      - "Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,"
      - "And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty"
      - "Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it."
      - "Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,"
      - "Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee,"
      - "And for thy maintenance commits his body"
      - "To painful labor both by sea and land,"
      - "To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,"
      - "Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,"
      - "And craves no other tribute at thy hands"
      - "But love, fair looks and true obedience—"
      - "Too little payment for so great a debt."
      - "Such duty as the subject owes the prince,"
      - "Even such a woman oweth to her husband."
      - "And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,"
      - "And not obedient to his honest will,"
      - "What is she but a foul contending rebel"
      - "And graceless traitor to her loving lord?"
      - "I am ashamed that women are so simple"
      - "To offer war where they should kneel for peace;"
      - "Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway"
      - "When they are bound to serve, love, and obey."

      - "Girls, girls! Wipe those frowns off your faces and stop rolling your eyes. This disrespectful stance toward the man who is your lord, your king, your governor tarnishes your beauty the way the frosts of winter blights the land. It mars your reputations as whirlwinds shake fair buds. And in no sense is it fitting or attractive. An angry woman is like an agitated fountain—muddy, unpleasant, lacking in beauty. And in this condition, no one—however dry or thirsty he may be—will stoop to sip or touch one drop of it. Your husband is your lord, your life, your keeper, your head, your sovereign, one who cares for you and who, for your ease and comfort, commits his body to harsh labor both on land and sea. Long, stormy nights at seas he stays awake, by day he endures cold while you lie safe and warm, secure in your beds at home. And in exchange he seeks no more from you but love, kind looks, and true obedience—too little payment for so great a debt. A woman owes her husband the same loyalty a subject owes his king. And when she is peevish and perverse, sullen, sour, and disobedient to his honest wishes, what is she but a loathsome, warlike rebel and an ungrateful traitor to her loving lord? I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace, that they seek authority, supremacy, and power when they are under an obligation to serve, love, and obey. Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, unfit for toil and trouble in the world, if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts? Come, come, you weak, ungovernable worms! My spirit has been as proud as each of yours, my courage as great, and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown. But now I see our weapons are like straws, our strength like a straw’s weakness, and our weakness past comparison, so that we seem to be the thing we most are not. Humble your pride, then, since it’s useless, and place your hand beneath your husband’s foot. As a gesture of my loyalty, my hand is ready if he cares to use it. May it bring him comfort."
