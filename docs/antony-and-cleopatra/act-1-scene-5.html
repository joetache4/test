<p>O Charmian,</p>

<p>The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm</p>

<p>Or murmuring “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?”</p>
<p>For so he calls me. Now I feed myself</p>
<p>With most delicious poison. Think on me,</p>
<p>That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black</p>
<p>And wrinkled deep in time. Broad-fronted Caesar,</p>
<p>When thou wast here above the ground, I was</p>
<p>A morsel for a monarch. And great Pompey</p>
<p>Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow.</p>
<p>There would he anchor his aspect, and die</p>
<p>With looking on his life.</p>
</td>

<b>CLEOPATRA</b>
<p>Oh, Charmian, where do you think he is now? Is he standing or sitting? Or is he walking? Or is he on his horse? Oh, how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him. Do well, horse. Do you know whom it is you carry? A man who carries responsibility for a third of the world on his shoulders. He’s speaking now, or perhaps he’s whispering, “Where’s my serpent of the Nile?” For that’s his pet name for me. I’m killing myself with this provocative speculation . . . Are you thinking about me? Even though I’ve been darkened by the sun and wrinkled with age? Caesar, with your broad forehead, when you were alive, I was the perfect young consort for a king. And powerful Pompey used to stare at me as if he were frozen in time.</p>

<p>Oh, what an even disposition he has! Observe, observe good Charmian! That’s exactly how he is! Just notice. He wasn’t sad, because he knows that his disposition affects others. He wasn’t merry, because to be merry would indicate that he had forgotten his love in Egypt. He was somewhere in the middle, between them . . . Oh, heavenly mixture!
