    o:
      - "I think he be transformed into a beast,"
      - "For I can nowhere find him like a man."
    m:
      - "I think he must have turned into an animal, because I can’t find him anywhere looking like a man."

    o:

    o:

  - sp: DUKE SENIOR
    o:
      - "Why, how now, monsieur? What a life is this"
      - "That your poor friends must woo your company?"
      - "What, you look merrily."
    m:
      - "Well, what’s going on, mister? What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company? What, you look amused."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "A fool, a fool, I met a fool i’ th’ forest,"
      - "A motley fool. A miserable world!"
      - "As I do live by food, I met a fool,"
      - "Who laid him down and basked him in the sun"
      - "And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,"
      - "In good set terms, and yet a motley fool."
      - "“Good morrow, fool,” quoth I. “No, sir,” quoth he,"
      - "“Call me not ’fool’ till heaven hath sent me fortune.”"
      - "And then he drew a dial from his poke"
      - "And, looking on it with lackluster eye,"
      - "Says very wisely, “It is ten o’clock."
      - "Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags."
      - "’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,"
      - "And after one hour more ’twill be eleven."
      - "And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,"
      - "And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,"
      - "The motley fool thus moral on the time,"
      - "And thereby hangs a tale.” When I did hear"
      - "My lungs began to crow like chanticleer"
      - "That fools should be so deep-contemplative,"
      - "And I did laugh sans intermission"
      - "An hour by his dial. O noble fool!"
      - "A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear."
    m:
      - "A fool, a fool! I met a fool in the forest, wearing motley. What a miserable world! As sure as I eat to stay alive, I met a fool who was lying in the sun and complaining about his fortune. He spoke smartly, though he was a fool. “Good morning, fool,” I said. “No, sir,” he said, “don’t call me a fool until heaven has sent me my fortune.” Then he pulled a watch from his bag and, looking at it solemnly, said, “It’s ten o’clock. This way, we can see how the world moves. Only an hour ago it was nine, and in another hour it will be eleven. And so, from hour to hour we ripen, and from hour to hour we rot. And there’s a story behind that.” When I heard that motley fool moralizing on the subject of time, I began to crow like a rooster. Hearing a fool speaking so contemplatively made me laugh non-stop for an hour. Oh, noble fool! A worthy fool! Motley is the only thing to wear."

  - sp: DUKE SENIOR
    o:
      - "What fool is this?"
    m:
      - "Who is this fool?"

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "O worthy fool!—One that hath been a courtier"
      - "And says, “If ladies be but young and fair,"
      - "They have the gift to know it.” And in his brain,"
      - "Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit"
      - "After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed"
      - "With observation, the which he vents"
      - "In mangled forms. Oh, that I were a fool!"
      - "I am ambitious for a motley coat."
    m:
      - "A worthy fool! He’s been a courtier and says, “If ladies are young and pretty, they always know it.” His brain is dry as a sailor’s biscuit and crammed with all sorts of strange observations, which he presents in mangled fashion. Oh, I wish I were a fool! I’m ambitious for one of those motley coats."

  - sp: DUKE SENIOR
    o:
      - "Thou shalt have one."
    m:
      - "You shall have one."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "It is my only suit,"
      - "Provided that you weed your better judgments"
      - "Of all opinion that grows rank in them"
      - "That I am wise. I must have liberty"
      - "Withal, as large a charter as the wind,"
      - "To blow on whom I please, for so fools have."
      - "And they that are most gallèd with my folly,"
      - "They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?"
      - "The “why” is plain as way to parish church:"
      - "He that a fool doth very wisely hit"
      - "Doth very foolishly, although he smart,"
      - "Not to seem senseless of the bob. If not,"
      - "The wise man’s folly is anatomized"
      - "Even by the squand’ring glances of the fool."
      - "Invest me in my motley. Give me leave"
      - "To speak my mind, and I will through and through"
      - "Cleanse the foul body of th’ infected world,"
      - "If they will patiently receive my medicine."
    m:
      - "That’s all I ask from you, as long as you promise to rid yourself of any rotten idea that I am wise. Like the wind, I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please, as fools do. And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest. Why, sir, must he? Well, it’s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church. Any person who thinks I’m satirizing them would be stupid if they didn’t pretend not to be hurt by my joke. Otherwise, they’d be admitting I was talking about them, and the fool would expose the wise man’s foolishness with a joke that wasn’t even meant for him. Dress me up in motley. Let me speak my mind, and I’ll rid the world of its sickness—if it will only tolerate my medicine."

  - sp: DUKE SENIOR
    o:
      - "Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do."
    m:
      - "To hell with you! I know what you’d do."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "What, for a counter, would I do but good?"
    m:
      - "What would I do besides good?"

  - sp: DUKE SENIOR
    o:
      - "Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin,"
      - "For thou thyself hast been a libertine,"
      - "As sensual as the brutish sting itself,"
      - "And all th’ embossèd sores and headed evils"
      - "That thou with license of free foot hast caught"
      - "Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world."
    m:
      - "You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning, because you yourself have been a terrible sinner, as carnal in your appetites as lust itself, and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "Why, who cries out on pride"
      - "That can therein tax any private party?"
      - "Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea"
      - "Till that the weary very means do ebb?"
      - "What woman in the city do I name,"
      - "When that I say the city-woman bears"
      - "The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?"
      - "Who can come in and say that I mean her,"
      - "When such a one as she such is her neighbor?"
      - "Or what is he of basest function"
      - "That says his bravery is not of my cost,"
      - "Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits"
      - "His folly to the mettle of my speech?"
      - "There then. How then, what then? Let me see wherein"
      - "My tongue hath wronged him. If it do him right,"
      - "Then he hath wronged himself. If he be free,"
      - "Why then my taxing like a wild goose flies"
      - "Unclaimed of any man. But who comes here?"
    m:
      - "But if I cry out against pride in general, how can anyone say I’m accusing a particular person? Aren’t we talking about a problem as vast as the sea, that keeps flowing until all the wealth in the world is almost used up by everyone showing off? What woman in the city am I talking about when I say that the clothes on a city-woman’s unworthy back are rich enough to suit a prince? Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her? And when some lowlife protests that *his* fancy clothes aren’t my problem, isn’t he basically admitting that I’m talking about him? Well, then. Tell me how I’ve wronged him. If I was right about him, he’s the one who’s done wrong. If he isn’t guilty of the faults I’m talking about, well then, my accusations fly by like wild geese, whom no one owns, since they don’t apply to any man. But who is this?"

  - sp: DUKE SENIOR
    o:
      - "Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress"
      - "Or else a rude despiser of good manners,"
      - "That in civility thou seem’st so empty?"
    m:
      - "Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners? Why do you seem so lacking in civility?"

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "You touched my vein at first. The thorny point"
      - "Of bare distress hath ta’en from me the show"
      - "Of smooth civility, yet am I inland bred"
      - "And know some nurture. But forbear, I say."
      - "He dies that touches any of this fruit"
      - "Till I and my affairs are answerèd."
    m:
      - "You were right the first time. My piercing distress has stripped me of smooth manners. But I wasn’t raised in the forest, and I was somewhat well-bred. But stop, I say. Whoever eats this fruit before I’ve been taken care of dies."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "An you will not be answered with reason, I must die."
    m:
      - "If you won’t listen to reason, I’ll have to die."

  - sp: DUKE SENIOR
    o:
      - "What would you have? Your gentleness shall force"
      - "More than your force move us to gentleness."
    m:
      - "What would you like? Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "I almost die for food, and let me have it."
    m:
      - "I’m dying for food, so let me have some."

  - sp: DUKE SENIOR
    o:
      - "Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table."
    m:
      - "Sit down and eat, and welcome to our table."

  - sp: ORLANDO
    o:
      - "Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you."
      - "I thought that all things had been savage here,"
      - "And therefore put I on the countenance"
      - "Of stern commandment. But whate’er you are"
      - "That in this desert inaccessible,"
      - "Under the shade of melancholy boughs,"
      - "Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time,"
      - "If ever you have looked on better days,"
      - "If ever been where bells have knolled to church,"
      - "If ever sat at any good man’s feast,"
      - "If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear"
      - "And know what ’tis to pity and be pitied,"
      - "Let gentleness my strong enforcement be,"
      - "In the which hope I blush and hide my sword."
    m:
      - "Do you really speak like such a gentleman? I beg your pardon. I thought everything out here was wild, which is why I acted so stern and commanding. But whoever you are—you who sit in the dark shade, losing track of time in this remote forest—if you have ever seen better days or been to church or sat at a man’s table for a feast or wiped a tear from your eye, if you know what it is to pity and be pitied, let my kindness and nobility persuade you. With that hope, I’ll blush at my rudeness and put away my sword."

  - sp: DUKE SENIOR
    o:
      - "True is it that we have seen better days"
      - "And have with holy bell been knolled to church,"
      - "And sat at good men’s feasts and wiped our eyes"
      - "Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered."
      - "And therefore sit you down in gentleness,"
      - "And take upon command what help we have"
      - "That to your wanting may be ministered."
    m:
      - "We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men’s feasts and cried tears of pity—therefore, sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs."

      - "And give it food. There is an old poor man"
      - "Who after me hath many a weary step"
      - "Limped in pure love. Till he be first sufficed,"
      - "Oppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger,"
      - "I will not touch a bit."
    m:
      - "Then please, put off your eating for a little while I, like a mother doe, find my fawn and bring it food. There is a poor old man who, purely out of love, has limped after me for miles. He’s burdened by two debilitating evils—age and hunger. Until he’s fed, I won’t eat a thing."

  - sp: DUKE SENIOR
    o:
      - "Go find him out,"
      - "And we will nothing waste till you return."
    m:
      - "Go find him. We won’t touch a thing till you return."

    o:

      - "This wide and universal theater"
      - "Presents more woeful pageants than the scene"
      - "Wherein we play in."
    m:
      - "You see, we’re not alone in our unhappiness. This wide, universal theater has more sad plays than our own little scene."

  - sp: JAQUES
    o:
      - "All the world’s a stage,"
      - "And all the men and women merely players."
      - "They have their exits and their entrances,"
      - "And one man in his time plays many parts,"
      - "His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,"
      - "Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms."
      - "Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel"
      - "And shining morning face, creeping like snail"
      - "Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,"
      - "Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad"
      - "Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,"
      - "Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,"
      - "Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,"
      - "Seeking the bubble reputation"
      - "Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,"
      - "In fair round belly with good capon lined,"
      - "With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,"
      - "Full of wise saws and modern instances;"
      - "And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts"
      - "Into the lean and slippered pantaloon"
      - "With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,"
      - "His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide"
      - "For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,"
      - "Turning again toward childish treble, pipes"
      - "And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,"
      - "That ends this strange eventful history,"
      - "Is second childishness and mere oblivion,"
      - "Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."
    m:
      - "The whole world is a stage, and all the men and women merely actors. They have their exits and their entrances, and in his lifetime a man will play many parts, his life separated into seven acts. In the first act he is an infant, whimpering and puking in his nurse’s arms. Then he’s the whining schoolboy, with a book bag and a bright, young face, creeping like a snail unwillingly to school. Then he becomes a lover, huffing and puffing like a furnace as he writes sad poems about his mistress’ eyebrows. In the fourth act, he’s a soldier, full of foreign curses, with a beard like a panther, eager to defend his honor and quick to fight. On the battlefield, he puts himself in front of the cannon’s mouth, risking his life to seek fame that is as fleeting as a soap bubble. In the fifth act, he is a judge, with a nice fat belly from all the bribes he’s taken. His eyes are stern, and he’s given his beard a respectable cut. He’s full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes: that’s the way he plays his part. In the sixth act, the curtain rises on a skinny old man in slippers, glasses on his nose and a money bag at his side. The stockings he wore in his youth hang loosely on his shriveled legs now, and his bellowing voice has shrunk back down to a childish squeak. In the last scene of our play—the end of this strange, eventful history—our hero, full of forgetfulness, enters his second childhood: without teeth, without eyes, without taste, without everything."
