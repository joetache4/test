<p>O, but they say the tongues of dying men</p>
<p>Enforce attention like deep harmony:</p>
<p>Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,</p>
<p>For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.</p>
<p>He that no more must say is listen’d more</p>
<p>Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;</p>
<p>More are men’s ends mark’d than their lives before:</p>
<p>The setting sun, and music at the close,</p>
<p>As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,</p>

<p>So it be new, there’s no respect how vile—</p>
<p>That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?</p>

<p>Where will doth mutiny with wit’s regard.</p>

<p>’Tis breath thou lack’st, and that breath wilt thou lose.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>DUKE OF YORK</b>
<p>No, he won’t listen—his ears are stuffed with all the sounds that make him happy, like the flattery and praise he receives, which wise men know to be wary of. He also likes raunchy poems, which immature young people always listen to. And he listens to the fashion reports from Italy, which England is always copying and always shamefully trying to catch up to. As long as it is new, no matter how awful it is, it instantly grabs Richard’s attention. His desire for all of these things doesn’t allow him to listen to good advice. Don’t give him direction, because he chooses his own course. You’ll just be wasting your precious breath.</p>

<p>Methinks I am a prophet new inspired</p>

<p>His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,</p>
<p>For violent fires soon burn out themselves;</p>
<p>Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;</p>
<p>He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;</p>
<p>With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:</p>
<p>Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,</p>
<p>Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.</p>
<p>This royal throne of kings, this scepter’d isle,</p>
<p>This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,</p>

<p>This fortress built by Nature for herself</p>
<p>Against infection and the hand of war,</p>

<p>Which serves it in the office of a wall,</p>
<p>Or as a moat defensive to a house,</p>
<p>Against the envy of less happier lands,</p>

<b>JOHN OF GAUNT</b>
<p>As I lie here dying, I think that God is suddenly letting me see the king’s future. The king can’t go on living a wasteful lifestyle forever, in the same way that a raging fire will eventually burn itself out. Little rainstorms often go on for a long time, but big, violent thunderstorms come and go quickly. The person who starts off too fast will soon tire out, and the person who eats too fast will choke on his food. The hungry bird that can’t get enough to eat will soon eat itself. This kingdom, this majestic Earth, this paradise, this fortress that Nature built to protect herself against disease and war, this lucky race of people, this little world, this precious jewel of an island sitting in the sea—which protects it like a wall or a moat against the evil intentions of less fortunate countries—this blessed land, this England, this fertile mother of kings who are feared and famous for their Christian actions throughout the world, this land of such good people, this wonderful, wonderful land—it is now rented out, and I’m going to have to die watching it happen. England is surrounded by an ocean whose rocky shore has always pushed back the raging waters. Now, though, England is bound in shame by legal papers, made of rotting parchment and covered in inky blots, that were signed to rent it out. England, which is used to conquering other countries, has now shamefully conquered itself. Oh, how I wish this scandal would die and go away, just like I’m about to die. How happy my death would be then!</p>

These men sailed the ships with three thousand soldiers from Port le Blanc, and right now they are racing to England. They left as soon as the king departed for Ireland. If you want to be free of your slavery to the king, help our country to rise again, and restore the honor of our royalty, then come with me right now to Ravenspurgh.
