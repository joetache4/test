  - os: "Enter Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH"
    ms: "Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH enter."

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "Well met, Corporal Nym."
    m:
      - "Good to see you, Corporal Nym."

  - sp: NYM
    o:
      - "Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph."
    m:
      - "Good day, Lieutenant Bardolph."

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?"
    m:
      - "Tell me, are you and Ensign Pistol friends again yet?"

  - sp: NYM
    o:
      - "For my part, I care not. I say little, but when time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that shall be as it may. I dare not fight, but I will wink and hold out mine iron. It is a simple one, but what though? It will toast cheese, and it will endure cold as another man’s sword will, and there’s an end."
    m:
      - "For my part, I really don’t care. I don’t say much, but when the time comes, we’ll smile at each other. But that’s as it may be. I won’t fight, but I can close my eyes and take a swipe with my sword—just a simple sword, but so what? It’s good enough to toast cheese, and it will survive cold as well as another man’s sword. And that’s that."

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and we’ll be all three sworn brothers to France. Let ’t be so, good Corporal Nym."
    m:
      - "I’ll buy you both breakfast if it will make you two friends. Then we can all three be comrades on our way to France. How about it, Corporal Nym?"

  - sp: NYM
    o:
      - "Faith, I will live so long as I may, that’s the certain of it. And when I cannot live any longer, I will do as I may. That is my rest; that is the rendezvous of it."
    m:
      - "Well, I will live until I die, that’s for sure, and when I can’t live anymore, I’ll deal with it. That’s it. That’s really all I can say."

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for you were troth-plight to her."
    m:
      - "It’s true, corporal, that he is married to Nell Quickly. And it’s true that she did you wrong, since you were engaged to her."

  - sp: NYM
    o:
      - "I cannot tell. Things must be as they may. Men may sleep, and they may have their throats about them at that time, and some say knives have edges. It must be as it may. Though patience be a tired mare, yet she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I cannot tell."
    m:
      - "It’s not for me to say. Things are what they are. Men may sleep, and when they do they may have their throats with them, and some people say knives have blades. What must be must be, and though my patience is worn out, it will last a little longer. There must be some resolution. Well, it’s not for me to say."

  - os: "Enter PISTOL and HOSTESS"
    ms: "PISTOL and HOSTESS quickly enter."

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife. Good corporal, be patient here.—How now, mine host Pistol?"
    m:
      - "Here comes Ensign Pistol and his wife. Be cool now, corporal.—How are you, Pistol, my good host?"

  - sp: PISTOL
    o:
      - "Base tyke, call’st thou me host?"
      - "Now, by this hand, I swear, I scorn the term,"
      - "Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers."
    m:
      - "You peasant dog, are you calling me a host? I swear, I scorn the word. My Nell isn’t going to be taking any lodgers."

  - sp: HOSTESS
    o:
      - "No, by my troth, not long, for we cannot lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of their needles but it will be thought we keep a bawdy house straight."
    m:
      - "No, not for long, that’s certain. For we couldn’t even put up a dozen or so nice girls who make an honest living sewing without our neighbors thinking we were running a brothel."

  - os: "NYM and PISTOL draw"
    ms: "NYM and PISTOL draw their swords."

  - o:
      - "Oh, well-a-day, Lady! If he be not hewn now, we shall see willful adultery and murder committed."
    m:
      - "Oh, dear. If he isn’t cut down in his tracks right now, we’ll see willful adultery and murder committed."

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "Good lieutenant, good corporal, offer nothing here."
    m:
      - "Good lieutenant, good corporal, don’t fight each other here."

  - sp: NYM
    o:
      - "Pish!"
    m:
      - "Pish!"

  - sp: PISTOL
    o:
      - "Pish for thee, Iceland dog,"
      - "Thou prick-eared cur of Iceland!"
    m:
      - "Pish to you, you mangy dog, you pointy-eared Icelandic mutt."

  - sp: HOSTESS
    o:
      - "Good Corporal Nym, show thy valor and put up your sword."
    m:
      - "Corporal Nym, be a man and put away your sword."

  - sp: NYM
    o:
      - "Will you shog off? *(to PISTOL)* I would have you *solus*."
    m:
      - "Get lost, will you? *(to PISTOL)* I’d like to get you solus."

  - sp: PISTOL
    o:
      - "*“Solus,”* egregious dog? O viper vile,"
      - "The *solus* in thy most marvelous face,"
      - "The *solus* in thy teeth and in thy throat"
      - "And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,"
      - "And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!"
      - "I do retort the *solus* in thy bowels,"
      - "For I can take, and Pistol’s cock is up,"
      - "And flashing fire will follow."
    m:
      - "*Solus,* you unspeakable dog? You loathsome snake, I throw your *solus* in that weird face of yours, in your teeth and your throat and in your hateful lungs, and even worse, in your nasty mouth! Shove that *solus* into your bowels, because I can take you. My gun is cocked and ready to fire."

  - sp: NYM
    o:
      - "I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an humor to knock you indifferently well. If you grow foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my rapier, as I may, in fair terms. If you would walk off, I would prick your guts a little in good terms, as I may, and that’s the humor of it."
    m:
      - "I am not some fiend of hell: you can’t get rid of me with spells. I’m in a mood to beat you up pretty good. If you get nasty with me, Pistol, I’ll stab you with my sword, in fair play. If you’d like to step aside with me, I’ll give you a little prick in the guts, all in fair play, if I can, and that’s the way it is."

  - sp: PISTOL
    o:
      - "O braggart vile and damnèd furious wight,"
      - "The grave doth gape, and doting death is near."
      - "Therefore exhale."
    m:
      - "You revolting braggart and hellish creature! Your grave is gaping open, and your death is near. So take your last breath."

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the first stroke,"
      - "I’ll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier. *(draws)*"
    m:
      - "Listen, listen to what I say: whoever strikes first, I’ll run him through with my sword, as sure as I’m a soldier. *(drawing his sword)*"

  - sp: PISTOL
    o:
      - "An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate."
      - "Give me thy fist, thy forefoot to me give."
      - "Thy spirits are most tall."
    m:
      - "That’s an oath of great power, and our fury must subside. *(PISTOL and NYM sheath their swords)* Give me your hand—your forefoot. You have a brave spirit."

  - sp: NYM
    o:
      - "I will cut thy throat one time or other in fair terms, that is the humor of it."
    m:
      - "I’ll cut your throat, sooner or later—that’s just how it is."

  - sp: PISTOL
    o:
      - "*Couple à gorge*, that is the word. I defy thee again."
      - "O hound of Crete, think’st thou my spouse to get?"
      - "No, to the spital go,"
      - "And from the powd’ring tub of infamy"
      - "Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid’s kind,"
      - "Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse."
      - "I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly"
      - "For the only she, And—*pauca—*there’s enough. Go to."
    m:
      - "Couple à gorge is the word for what you’re trying to say. I defy you again. You dog, do you think you’ll take my wife? No, go to the hospital, into the ward where they treat venereal disease, and get yourself a leprous, diseased prostitute like Doll Tearsheet and marry her. I won the former Mistress Quickly and I’ll keep her as my only wife, and—Damn it! That’s enough. Come on!"

  - os: "Enter the BOY"
    ms: "A BOY enters."

  - sp: BOY
    o:
      - "Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master and your hostess. He is very sick and would to bed.—Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he’s very ill."
    m:
      - "My host Pistol, you must come to my master. You too, my hostess: he is very sick and should be put to bed. Bardolph, put your face between his sheets and act as a warming pan. Really, he’s very sick!"

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "Away, you rogue!"
    m:
      - "Get out of here, you punk!"

  - sp: HOSTESS
    o:
      - "By my troth, he’ll yield the crow a pudding one of these days. The king has killed his heart. Good husband, come home presently."
    m:
      - "I swear, he’ll be food for the crows soon. The king has broken his heart. Good husband, come home soon."

  - os: "Exeunt HOSTESS and BOY"
    ms: "HOSTESS QUICKLY and BOY exit."

  - sp: BARDOLPH
    o:
      - "Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to France together. Why the devil should we keep knives to cut one another’s throats?"
    m:
      - "Come on, can I get you two to make up? We have to go to France together: why should we cut each other’s throats?"

  - sp: PISTOL

  - sp: BARDOLPH

    m:
      - "Corporal Nym, if you want to be friends, be friends. If not, then you can be my enemy, too. Come on, put it away."

    m:
      - "I’ll give you a noble right now, and I’ll give you liquor, too, and friendship and brotherhood. I’ll live for Nym, and Nym will live for me. Is that fair? For I’ll be selling provisions to the troops, and there’ll be profits to go around. Give me your hand."
