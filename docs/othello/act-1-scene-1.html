<b>IAGO</b>
<p>I do hate him, I swear. Three of Venice’s most important noblemen took their hats off to him and asked him humbly to make me his lieutenant, the second in command. And I know my own worth well enough to know I deserve that position. But he wants to have things his own way, so he sidesteps the issue with a lot of military talk and refuses their request. “I’ve already chosen my lieutenant,” he says. And who does he choose? A guy who knows more about numbers then fighting! This guy from Florence named Michael Cassio. He has a pretty wife but he can’t even control her. And he’s definitely never commanded men in battle. He’s got no more hands-on knowledge of warfare than an old woman—unless you count what he’s read in books, which any peace-lover can do. His military understanding is all theory, no practice. But Cassio’s been chosen over me. My career is cut short by some bookkeeper, even though the general saw my fighting skills first-hand in Rhodes and Cyprus. This accountant is now lieutenant, while I end up as the Moor’s flag-bearer.</p>

<b>IAGO</b>
<p>No, calm down. I’m serving under him to take advantage of him. We can’t all be masters, and not all masters should be followed. Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food, and then when they get old they’re terminated. They ought to be whipped for being so stupid. But then there’s another kind of servant who looks dutiful and devoted, but who’s really looking out for himself. By pretending to serve their lords, these men get rich, and when they’ve saved up enough they can be their own masters. Guys like that have soul, and that’s the kind of guy I am. Let me tell you, as sure as your name’s Roderigo, if I were the Moor I wouldn’t want to be Iago. I may seem to love and obey him, but in fact, I’m just serving him to get what I want. If my outward appearance started reflecting what I really felt, soon enough I’d be wearing my heart on my sleeve for birds to peck at. No, it’s better to hide it. I’m not who I appear to be.</p>

<p>Lead the way. I’ll stop at every house. I’m respected enough that most of them will do what I say.—Get your weapons! And get the officers who guard the city at night.—Let’s go, Roderigo. I’ll reward you for your troubles.</p>
