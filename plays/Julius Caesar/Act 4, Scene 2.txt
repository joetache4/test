  - os: "Drum. Enter BRUTUS with LUCIUS, LUCILLIUS, and the army. TITINIUS and PINDARUS meet them"
    ms: "A drum plays. BRUTUS, LUCILLIUS, LUCIUS, and SOLDIERS enter. TITINIUS and PINDARUS meet them."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Stand, ho!"
    m:
      - "Stop."

  - sp: LUCILLIUS
    o:
      - "Give the word, ho, and stand."
    m:
      - "Pass on the command to halt!"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "What now, Lucillius? Is Cassius near?"
    m:
      - "What’s happening now, Lucillius? Is Cassius nearby?"

  - sp: LUCILLIUS
    o:
      - "He is at hand, and Pindarus is come"
      - "To do you salutation from his master."
    m:
      - "He’s nearby, and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "He greets me well.—Your master, Pindarus,"
      - "In his own change or by ill officers"
      - "Hath given me some worthy cause to wish"
      - "Things done, undone. But if he be at hand"
      - "I shall be satisfied."
    m:
      - "He sends his greetings through a good man. Your master, Pindarus, either because he’s changed his mind or been influenced by bad officers, has made me wish we hadn’t done some of the things we did. If he’s nearby, I want an explanation."

  - sp: PINDARUS
    o:
      - "    I do not doubt"
      - "But that my noble master will appear"
      - "Such as he is, full of regard and honor."
    m:
      - "I have no doubt that my noble master will prove himself to be what he is: honorable and noble."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "He is not doubted.—A word, Lucillius."
      - "*(takes LUCILLIUS aside)*"
      - "How he received you, let me be resolved."
    m:
      - "I don’t doubt him. Can I have a word with you, Lucillius? *(takes LUCILLIUS aside)* Tell me how Cassius treated you. Put my mind at rest."

  - sp: LUCILLIUS
    o:
      - "With courtesy and with respect enough."
      - "But not with such familiar instances"
      - "Nor with such free and friendly conference"
      - "As he hath used of old."
    m:
      - "He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect, but not with affection, nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "    Thou hast described"
      - "A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucillius,"
      - "When love begins to sicken and decay,"
      - "It useth an enforcèd ceremony."
      - "There are no tricks in plain and simple faith."
      - "But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,"
      - "Make gallant show and promise of their mettle."
    m:
      - "You’ve described a warm friend who’s cooling off. Remember this, Lucillius. When a friend starts to get sick of you, he treats you artificially. Plain and simple loyalty doesn’t make anyone act phony. But insincere men, like horses who are too lively at the start of a race, make a big show of their spirit."

  - os: "Low march within"
    ms: "A low sound of drums and SOLDIERS marching."

  - o:
      - "But when they should endure the bloody spur,"
      - "They fall their crests and, like deceitful jades,"
      - "Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?"
    m:
      - "But when push comes to shove, they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl. Is his army approaching?"

  - sp: LUCILLIUS
    o:
      - "They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered."
      - "The greater part, the horse in general,"
      - "Are come with Cassius."
    m:
      - "They plan to spend the night in Sardis. The larger part, the main body of cavalry, are coming with Cassius."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "    Hark! He is arrived."
      - "March gently on to meet him."
    m:
      - "Look! He’s arrived. March to meet him at a dignified pace."

  - os: "Enter CASSIUS and his powers"
    ms: "CASSIUS enters with his army."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "Stand, ho!"
    m:
      - "Halt."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Stand, ho! Speak the word along."
    m:
      - "Halt! Pass the order along."

  - sp: FIRST SOLDIER
    o:
      - "Stand!"
    m:
      - "Halt!"

  - sp: SECOND SOLDIER
    o:
      - "Stand!"
    m:
      - "Halt!"

  - sp: THIRD SOLDIER
    o:
      - "Stand!"
    m:
      - "Halt!"

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "Most noble brother, you have done me wrong."
    m:
      - "Most noble brother, you have done me wrong."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?"
      - "And if not so, how should I wrong a brother?"
    m:
      - "Let the gods judge me! Do I mistreat even my enemies? No. So how could I possibly wrong a brother?"

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs."
      - "And when you do them—"
    m:
      - "Brutus, your sober expression is a mask to hide the fact that you’ve wronged me. And when you do—"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "    Cassius, be content."
      - "Speak your griefs softly. I do know you well."
      - "Before the eyes of both our armies here,"
      - "Which should perceive nothing but love from us,"
      - "Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away."
      - "Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,"
      - "And I will give you audience."
    m:
      - "Cassius, calm down. We know each other well, and you can speak your grievances quietly. Let’s not argue here in front of both our armies, which ought to see nothing but love between us. Order them to move back. Then, in my tent, you can elaborate on your complaints, and I’ll listen."

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "    Pindarus,"
      - "Bid our commanders lead their charges off"
      - "A little from this ground."
    m:
      - "Pindarus, order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "Lucillius, do you the like. And let no man"
      - "Come to our tent till we have done our conference."
      - "Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door."
    m:
      - "Lucillius, you do the same, and don’t allow anyone to come into our tent until we’ve finished our conference. Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "Everyone except BRUTUS and CASSIUS exits."
