    m:

      - "An humble heart—"
    m:
      - "*(kneeling)* Most high, most mighty, and most powerful Caesar, Metellus Cimber kneels before you with a humble heart—"

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "    I must prevent thee, Cimber."
      - "These couchings and these lowly courtesies"
      - "Might fire the blood of ordinary men"
      - "And turn preordinance and first decree"
      - "Into the law of children. Be not fond,"
      - "To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood"
      - "That will be thawed from the true quality"
      - "With that which melteth fools—I mean, sweet words,"
      - "Low-crookèd curtsies, and base spaniel fawning."
      - "Thy brother by decree is banishèd."
      - "If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,"
      - "I spurn thee like a cur out of my way."
      - "Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause"
      - "Will he be satisfied."
    m:
      - "I have to stop you, Cimber. These kneelings and humble courtesies might excite ordinary men, flattering them into turning Roman law into children’s games. But don’t be so foolish as to think you can sway *me* from what’s right by using the tactics that persuade fools—I mean this flattery, low bows, and puppy-like fawning. Your brother has been banished by decree. If you kneel and beg and flatter for him, I’ll kick you out of my way like I would a dog. Know that I am not unjust, and I will not grant him a pardon without reason."

  - sp: METELLUS
    o:
      - "Is there no voice more worthy than my own"
      - "To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear"
      - "For the repealing of my banished brother?"
    m:
      - "Is there no voice worthier than my own to appeal to Caesar to repeal the order that my brother be banished?"

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:
      - "*(kneeling)* I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,"
      - "Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may"
      - "Have an immediate freedom of repeal."
    m:
      - "*(kneeling)* I kiss your hand, but not in flattery, Caesar. I ask you to repeal Publius Cimber’s banishment immediately."

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "What, Brutus?"
    m:
      - "What, even you, Brutus?"

  - sp: CASSIUS
    o:
      - "*(kneeling)*   Pardon, Caesar. Caesar, pardon."
      - "As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall"
      - "To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber."
    m:
      - "*(kneeling)* Pardon him, Caesar, pardon him. I fall to your feet to beg you to restore Publius Cimber to citizenship."

  - sp: CAESAR
    o:
      - "I could be well moved if I were as you."
      - "If I could pray to move, prayers would move me."
      - "But I am constant as the northern star,"
      - "Of whose true-fixed and resting quality"
      - "There is no fellow in the firmament."
      - "The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks."
      - "They are all fire and every one doth shine,"
      - "But there’s but one in all doth hold his place."
      - "So in the world. ’Tis furnished well with men,"
      - "And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive,"
      - "Yet in the number I do know but one"
      - "That unassailable holds on his rank,"
      - "Unshaked of motion. And that I am he"
      - "Let me a little show it even in this:"
      - "That I was constant Cimber should be banished,"
      - "And constant do remain to keep him so."
    m:
      - "I could be convinced if I were like you. If I could beg others to change their minds, begging would convince me, too. But I’m as immovable as the northern star, whose stable and stationary quality has no equal in the sky. The sky shows countless stars. They’re all made of fire, and each one shines. But only one among all of them remains in a fixed position. So it is on earth. The world is full of men, and men are flesh and blood, and they are capable of reason. Yet out of all of them, I know only one who is unassailable, who never moves from his position. To show you that that’s me, let me prove it a little even in this case. I was firm in ordering that Cimber be banished, and I remain firm in that decision."

    m:

      - "Fly not. Stand still. Ambition’s debt is paid."
    m:

      - "Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief."

Kneel, Romans, kneel, and let’s wash our hands, up to the elbows, in Caesar’s blood and smear it on our swords. Then we’ll go out, even to the marketplace, and, waving our bloody swords over our heads, let’s cry, “Peace, freedom, and liberty!”"

Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Antony loves Brutus and honors him. Antony feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will swear that Antony may come to him safely and be convinced that Caesar deserved to be killed, Mark Antony will love dead Caesar not nearly as much as living Brutus, and with true faith he’ll follow the destiny and affairs of noble Brutus through the difficulties of this unprecedented state of affairs.” That’s what my master, Antony, says."

      - "I shall not find myself so apt to die."
      - "No place will please me so, no mean of death,"
      - "As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,"
      - "The choice and master spirits of this age."
    m:
      - "Oh, mighty Caesar! Do you lie so low? Have all your conquests, glories, triumphs, achievements, come to so little? Farewell. Gentlemen, I don’t know what you intend to do, who else you intend to kill, who else you consider corrupt. If it’s me, there’s no time as good as this hour of Caesar’s death, and no weapon better than your swords, covered with the noblest blood in the world. I ask you, if you have a grudge against me, to kill me now, while your stained hands still reek of blood. I could live a thousand years and I wouldn’t be as ready to die as I am now. There’s no place I’d rather die than here by Caesar, and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you, the masters of this new era."

  - sp: BRUTUS
    o:

      - "And this the bleeding business they have done."
      - "Our hearts you see not. They are pitiful."
      - "And pity to the general wrong of Rome—"
      - "As fire drives out fire, so pity pity—"
      - "Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,"
      - "To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony."

Though we seem bloody and cruel right now, with our bloody hands and this deed we’ve done, you’ve only seen our hands and their bloody business; you haven’t looked into our hearts. They are full of pity for Caesar. But a stronger pity, for the wrongs committed against Rome, drove out our pity for Caesar, as fire drives out fire, and so we killed him. For you, our swords have blunt edges, too dull to harm you, Mark Antony. Our arms, which can be strong and cruel, and our hearts, filled with brotherly love, embrace you with kind love, good thoughts, and reverence."

Now that I’ve shaken your hands, you’ll take me for either a coward or a flatterer—in either case, my credibility stands on slippery ground. It’s true that I loved you, Caesar—nothing could be truer. If your spirit is looking down upon us now, it must hurt you more than even your death to see your Antony making peace—shaking the bloody hands of your enemies—in front of your corpse. If I had as many eyes as you have wounds, and they wept as fast as your wounds stream blood—even that would be more becoming than joining your enemies in friendship. Forgive me, Julius! On this very spot you were hunted down, like a brave deer. And here you fell, where your hunters are now standing. The spot is marked by your death and stained by your blood. Oh world, you were the forest to this deer, and this deer, oh world, was your dear. Now you lie here, stabbed by many princes!"

Fierce civil war will paralyze all of Italy. Blood and destruction will be so common and familiar that mothers will merely smile when their infants are cut to pieces by the hands of war. People’s capacity for sympathy will grow tired and weak from the sheer quantity of cruel deeds. And Caesar’s ghost, searching for revenge with the goddess Ate by his side, just up from Hell, will cry in the voice of a king, “Havoc!” and unleash the dogs of war. This foul deed will stink up to the sky with men’s corpses, which will beg to be buried."
