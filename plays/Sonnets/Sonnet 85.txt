      - "My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,"
      - "While comments of your praise, richly compiled,"
      - "Reserve their character with golden quill"
      - "And precious phrase by all the muses filed."
      - "I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,"
      - "And like unlettered clerk still cry “Amen”"
      - "To every hymn that able spirit affords,"
      - "In polished form of well-refinèd pen."
      - "Hearing you praised, I say “’Tis so, ’tis true,”"
      - "And to the most of praise add something more;"
      - "But that is in my thought, whose love to you,"
      - "Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before."
      - "  Then others for the breath of words respect,"
      - "  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect."

      - "My mute poetry politely remains silent, while commentaries praising you pile up, capturing the essence of your character in golden words and precious phrases inspired by all the muses. I think good thoughts about you while other people write good words, and like an illiterate parish clerk I continually cry “amen” to every poem of praise that capable poets produce about you in their polished and refined style. When I hear you praised, I say, “That’s right, that’s true,” and add a little something to their utmost praise of you. What I add is only in my own mind, but in my own mind I know I love you the most, though I speak the least. So respect others for the words of praise they offer you, but respect me for my silent thoughts, which express themselves only in actions."
