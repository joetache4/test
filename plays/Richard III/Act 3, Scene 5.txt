  - os: "Enter RICHARD and BUCKINGHAM, in rotten armor, marvelous ill-favored"
    ms: "RICHARD and BUCKINGHAM enter wearing rusty, hideous-looking armor."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change thy color,"
      - "Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,"
      - "And then begin again, and stop again,"
      - "As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?"
    m:
      - "Tell me, cousin, I need to know if you can shake like you’ve got a fever, turn pale all of a sudden, and stop speaking in the middle of a word—as if you were driven crazy with fear."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian,"
      - "Speak, and look back, and pry on every side,"
      - "Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,"
      - "Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks"
      - "Are at my service, like enforcèd smiles,"
      - "And both are ready in their offices,"
      - "At any time to grace my stratagems."
      - "But what, is Catesby gone?"
    m:
      - "Oh please, I can imitate the best tragic actor around. I can speak and then look all around, and tremble, and start at a mere piece of straw as if I were paranoid. Frightening looks are also at my service, as are fake smiles. Anytime I need them, they’re waiting to do my bidding. But has Catesby gone?"

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "He is; and see, he brings the mayor along."
    m:
      - "He has. But here he is, back with the mayor."

  - os: "Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY"
    ms: "The LORD MAYOR and CATESBY enter."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "Lord Mayor—"
    m:
      - "Lord Mayor—"

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Look to the drawbridge there!"
    m:
      - "Watch out for the drawbridge over there!"

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "Hark, a drum!"
    m:
      - "Listen! A drum!"

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Catesby, o’erlook the walls."
    m:
      - "Catesby, look over the top of these walls to see if anyone’s there."

  - os: "Exit CATESBY"
    ms: "CATESBY exits."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent—"
    m:
      - "Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent—"

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Look back! Defend thee! Here are enemies."
    m:
      - "Look behind you! Defend yourself! There are enemies here."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "God and our innocence defend and guard us!"
    m:
      - "God defend and guard us innocents against them!"

  - os: "Enter LOVELL and RATCLIFFE, with HASTINGS’ head"
    ms: "LOVELL and RATCLIFFE enter with HASTINGS’ head."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Be patient. They are friends, Ratcliffe and Lovell."
    m:
      - "Stay calm. They’re friends—Ratcliffe and Lovell."

  - sp: LOVELL
    o:
      - "Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,"
      - "The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings."
    m:
      - "Here’s the head of that notorious traitor, the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "So dear I loved the man that I must weep."
      - "I took him for the plainest harmless creature"
      - "That breathed upon this earth a Christian;"
      - "Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded"
      - "The history of all her secret thoughts."
      - "So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue"
      - "That, his apparent open guilt omitted—"
      - "I mean his conversation with Shore’s wife—"
      - "He lived from all attainder of suspects."
    m:
      - "I loved this man so much it makes me weep. I took him to be the plainest, most harmless Christian on earth. He was the book in which I recorded all of my most secret thoughts. He was so slick in covering over his plans that if it hadn’t been for his love affair with Shore’s wife, I would never have suspected him."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "Well, well, he was the covert’st sheltered traitor"
      - "That ever lived.—"
      - "Would you imagine, or almost believe,"
      - "Were ’t not that by great preservation"
      - "We live to tell it, that subtle traitor"
      - "This day had plotted, in the council house"
      - "To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?"
    m:
      - "Well, well, he was the most covert traitor who ever lived. Would you believe, if we hadn’t caught him, this subtle traitor would have murdered the Lord of Gloucester and me in the council room today?"

  - sp: LORD MAYOR
    o:
      - "Had he done so?"
    m:
      - "He would have?"

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "What, think you we are Turks or infidels?"
      - "Or that we would, against the form of law,"
      - "Proceed thus rashly in the villain’s death,"
      - "But that the extreme peril of the case,"
      - "The peace of England and our persons’ safety"
      - "Enforced us to this execution?"
    m:
      - "What, do you think we’re Turks or savages, instead of Christians? You think we would have disobeyed the law and proceeded to kill this villain if England’s peace and our own lives hadn’t been at stake?"

  - sp: LORD MAYOR
    o:
      - "Now fair befall you! He deserved his death,"
      - "And your good Graces both have well proceeded"
      - "To warn false traitors from the like attempts."
    m:
      - "I hope nothing else like this ever happens to you! This man deserved his death. And you, my good lords, were right to warn other traitors from trying the same."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "I never looked for better at his hands"
      - "After he once fell in with Mistress Shore."
      - "Yet had we not determined he should die"
      - "Until your Lordship came to see his end"
      - "(Which now the loving haste of these our friends,"
      - "Something against our meaning, have prevented),"
      - "Because, my lord, I would have had you heard"
      - "The traitor speak, and timorously confess"
      - "The manner and the purpose of his treasons,"
      - "That you might well have signified the same"
      - "Unto the citizens, who haply may"
      - "Misconstrue us in him, and wail his death."
    m:
      - "I didn’t expect any better from him once he got involved with Mistress Shore. But we had decided that he shouldn’t die until you were able to come witness his execution. (Which was prevented by the haste of our friends, Lovell and Ratcliffe here, who went against what we intended somewhat in their hurry to protect us). If you could have heard the traitor speak for himself and confess the exact way he planned to murder us, you could have told the citizens what terrible intentions he had, though now they’re likely to misconstrue what we did and wail over his death."

  - sp: LORD MAYOR
    o:
      - "But, my good lord, your Graces’ words shall serve"
      - "As well as I had seen and heard him speak;"
      - "And do not doubt, right noble princes both,"
      - "But I’ll acquaint our duteous citizens"
      - "With all your just proceedings in this case."
    m:
      - "But, my good lord, the words of you and Lord Buckingham are as trustworthy to me as if I had seen and heard him speak myself. And do not doubt, you honest, noble princes, that I’ll let our citizens know how fairly you proceeded in this case."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "And to that end we wished your Lordship here"
      - "T’ avoid the censures of the carping world."
    m:
      - "That is exactly why we wanted you here, your lordship—to avoid the public carping and complaints."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "Which since you come too late of our intent,"
      - "Yet witness what you hear we did intend."
      - "And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell."
    m:
      - "But since you’ve come too late to see the execution as we intended, at least let people know what you *hear* we intended. And so, good Lord Mayor, we bid you goodbye."

  - os: "Exit LORD MAYOR"
    ms: "The LORD MAYOR exits."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham."
      - "The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post."
      - "There, at your meetest vantage of the time,"
      - "Infer the bastardy of Edward’s children."
      - "Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen"
      - "Only for saying he would make his son"
      - "Heir to the Crown—meaning indeed his house,"
      - "Which, by the sign thereof, was termèd so."
      - "Moreover, urge his hateful luxury"
      - "And bestial appetite in change of lust,"
      - "Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,"
      - "Even where his raging eye or savage heart,"
      - "Without control, lusted to make his prey."
      - "Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:"
      - "Tell them when that my mother went with child"
      - "Of that insatiate Edward, noble York"
      - "My princely father then had wars in France,"
      - "And, by true computation of the time,"
      - "Found that the issue was not his begot,"
      - "Which well appearèd in his lineaments,"
      - "Being nothing like the noble duke my father."
      - "Yet touch this sparingly, as ’twere far off,"
      - "Because, my lord, you know my mother lives."
    m:
      - "Follow him, Buckingham. He’s traveling at a gallop to the London meeting hall. There, as soon as you have a chance, drop the hint that Edward’s children are bastards. Tell the citizens how Edward put to death a citizen just because the citizen said he was going to make his own son “heir to the crown”—when all the citizen meant was that he owned a tavern called “the Crown” and was going to leave it to his son. And then point out what a lech Edward was and what a bestial appetite he had for women, which touched even the citizens’ own servants, daughters, and wives. There was no limit to what his lustful eye and savage heart would prey on. And, if you need to, approach the subject of me: tell them that when my mother became pregnant with the insatiable Edward, my noble father was fighting in France. With a little calculating, it’s obvious that Edward is not in fact my father’s child—not a surprising revelation if you consider how my father the noble duke looked nothing like this man. But only hint at this vaguely, because, as you know, my mother’s still alive."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "Doubt not, my lord. I’ll play the orator"
      - "As if the golden fee for which I plead"
      - "Were for myself. And so, my lord, adieu."
    m:
      - "Don’t worry, my lord, I’ll be as eloquent as if the golden crown I’m pleading for were for myself. Goodbye, my lord."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard’s Castle,"
      - "Where you shall find me well accompanied"
      - "With reverend fathers and well-learnèd bishops."
    m:
      - "If things go well, bring the crowd to Baynard’s Castle, where I’ll be surrounded by priests and learned bishops."

  - sp: BUCKINGHAM
    o:
      - "I go; and towards three or four o’clock"
      - "Look for the news that the Guildhall affords."
    m:
      - "I’m off. Around three or four o’clock, look for news from the meeting hall."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "BUCKINGHAM exits."

  - sp: RICHARD
    o:
      - "Go, Lovell, with all speed to Doctor Shaw."
      - "*(to RATCLIFFE)* Go thou to Friar Penker. Bid them both"
      - "Meet me within this hour at Baynard’s Castle."
    m:
      - "Lovell, go as fast as you can to Doctor Shaw. *(to RATCLIFFE)* Go to Friar Penker. Both of you, tell these men to meet me in less than an hour at Baynard’s Castle."

  - os: "Exit LOVELL and RATCLIFFE"
    ms: "LOWELL and RADCLIFFE exits."

  - o:
      - "Now will I go to take some privy order"
      - "To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,"
      - "And to give order that no manner of person"
      - "Have any time recourse unto the princes."
    m:
      - "Now I’ll go inside and write out a secret order to keep Clarence’s brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing King Edward’s sons."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."
