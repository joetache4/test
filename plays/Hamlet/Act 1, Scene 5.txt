  - sp: GHOST
    o:
      - "Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing"

    m:

  - sp: GHOST
    o:

    m:

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "What?"
    m:
      - "What?"

  - sp: GHOST
    o:
      - "I am thy father’s spirit,"
      - "Doomed for a certain term to walk the night"
      - "And for the day confined to fast in fires,"
      - "Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature"
      - "Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid"
      - "To tell the secrets of my prison house,"
      - "I could a tale unfold whose lightest word"
      - "Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,"
      - "Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,"
      - "Thy knotted and combinèd locks to part"
      - "And each particular hair to stand on end,"
      - "Like quills upon the fearful porpentine."
      - "But this eternal blazon must not be"
      - "To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!"
      - "If thou didst ever thy dear father love—"
    m:
      - "I’m the ghost of your father, doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night, while during the day I’m trapped in the fires of purgatory until I’ve done penance for my past sins. If I weren’t forbidden to tell you the secrets of purgatory, I could tell you stories that would slice through your soul, freeze your blood, make your eyes jump out of their sockets, and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills. But mortals like you aren’t allowed to hear this description of the afterlife. Listen, listen! If you ever loved your poor dear father—"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "O God!"
    m:
      - "Oh God!"

  - sp: GHOST
    o:
      - "Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder."
    m:
      - "Take revenge for his horrible murder, that crime against nature."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Murder?"
    m:
      - "Murder?"

  - sp: GHOST
    o:
      - "Murder most foul, as in the best it is."
      - "But this most foul, strange and unnatural."
    m:
      - "His most horrible murder. Murder’s always horrible, but this one was especially horrible, weird, and unnatural."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Haste me to know ’t, that I, with wings as swift"
      - "As meditation or the thoughts of love,"
      - "May sweep to my revenge."
    m:
      - "Hurry and tell me about it, so I can take revenge right away, faster than a person falls in love."

  - sp: GHOST
    o:
      - "    I find thee apt,"
      - "And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed"
      - "That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,"
      - "Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear."
      - "’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,"
      - "A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark"
      - "Is by a forgèd process of my death"
      - "Rankly abused. But know, thou noble youth,"
      - "The serpent that did sting thy father’s life"
      - "Now wears his crown."
    m:
      - "I’m glad you’re eager. You’d have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of Lethe not to get riled up here. Now listen, Hamlet. Everyone was told that a poisonous snake bit me when I was sleeping in the orchard. But in fact, that’s a lie that’s fooled everyone in Denmark. You should know, my noble son, the real snake that stung your father is now wearing his crown."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "O my prophetic soul! My uncle?"
    m:
      - "I knew it! My uncle?"

  - sp: GHOST
    o:
      - "Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,"
      - "With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts—"
      - "O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power"
      - "So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust"
      - "The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen."
      - "O Hamlet, what a falling off was there!"
      - "From me, whose love was of that dignity"
      - "That it went hand in hand even with the vow"
      - "I made to her in marriage, and to decline"
      - "Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor"
      - "To those of mine."
      - "But virtue, as it never will be moved,"
      - "Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,"
      - "So lust, though to a radiant angel linked,"
      - "Will sate itself in a celestial bed"
      - "And prey on garbage."
      - "But soft! Methinks I scent the morning air."
      - "Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,"
      - "My custom always of the afternoon,"
      - "Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole"
      - "With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,"
      - "And in the porches of my ears did pour"
      - "The leperous distilment, whose effect"
      - "Holds such an enmity with blood of man"
      - "That swift as quicksilver it courses through"
      - "The natural gates and alleys of the body"
      - "And with a sudden vigor doth posset"
      - "And curd, like eager droppings into milk,"
      - "The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine."
      - "And a most instant tetter barked about,"
      - "Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust"
      - "All my smooth body."
      - "Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand"
      - "Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,"
      - "Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,"
      - "Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled."
      - "No reckoning made, but sent to my account"
      - "With all my imperfections on my head."
      - "Oh, horrible, oh, horrible, most horrible!"
      - "If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not."
      - "Let not the royal bed of Denmark be"
      - "A couch for luxury and damnèd incest."
      - "But howsoever thou pursuest this act,"
      - "Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive"
      - "Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven"
      - "And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge"
      - "To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once."
      - "The glowworm shows the matin to be near,"
      - "And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire."
      - "Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me."
    m:
      - "Yes, that incestuous, adulterous animal. With his clever words and fancy gifts, he seduced my seemingly virtuous queen, persuading her to give in to his lust. They were evil words and gifts to seduce her like that! Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell! She went from me, who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage, to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine. But just as you can’t corrupt a truly virtuous person no matter how you try, the opposite is also true: a lustful person like her can satisfy herself in a heavenly union and then move on to garbage. But hang on, I think I smell the morning air. So let me be brief here. Your uncle snuck up to me while I was sleeping in the orchard, as I always used to do in the afternoon, and poured a vial of henbane poison into my ear—that poison that moves like quicksilver through the veins and curdles the blood, which is just what it did to me. I broke out in a scaly rash that covered my smooth body with a revolting crust. And that’s how my brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once. He cut me off in the middle of a sinful life. I had no chance to repent my sins or receive last rites. Oh, it’s horrible, horrible, so horrible! If you are human, don’t stand for it. Don’t let the Danish king’s bed be a nest of incest. But however you go about your revenge, don’t corrupt your mind or do any harm to your mother. Leave her to God and her own guilt. Now, good-bye. The glowworm’s light is beginning to fade, so morning is near. Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye. Remember me."

    o:
      - "O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?"
      - "And shall I couple hell? Oh, fie! Hold, hold, my heart,"
      - "And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,"
      - "But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!"
      - "Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat"
      - "In this distracted globe. Remember thee!"
      - "Yea, from the table of my memory"
      - "I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records,"
      - "All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past"
      - "That youth and observation copied there,"
      - "And thy commandment all alone shall live"
      - "Within the book and volume of my brain,"
      - "Unmixed with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!"
      - "O most pernicious woman!"
      - "O villain, villain, smiling, damnèd villain!"
      - "My tables!—Meet it is I set it down"
      - "That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain."
      - "At least I’m sure it may be so in Denmark. *(writes)*"
      - "So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word."
      - "It is “Adieu, adieu. Remember me.”"
      - "I have sworn ’t."
    m:
      - "Ah, all you up in heaven! And earth! What else? Shall I include hell as well? Damn it! Keep beating, my heart, and muscles, don’t grow old yet—keep me standing. Remember you! Yes, you poor ghost, as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head. Remember you! Yes, I’ll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there. Yes, by God! Oh, you evil woman! Oh, you villain, villain, you damned, smiling villain! Where’s my notebook?—It’s a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile, and be a villain. At least it’s possible in Denmark. *(he writes)* So, uncle, there you are. Now it’s time to deal with the vow I made to my father. He said, “Remember me.” I swore I would."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:

      - "And so, without more circumstance at all,"
      - "I hold it fit that we shake hands and part."
      - "You, as your business and desire shall point you—"
      - "For every man has business and desire,"
      - "Such as it is—and for my own poor part,"
      - "Look you, I’ll go pray."
    m:
      - "Yes, you’re absolutely right. So, without further ado, the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways. You go and take care of your business (since everybody has some business to take care of, whatever it is worth), and I’ll go and pray."

  - sp: HORATIO

      - "As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,"
      - "Give me one poor request."
    m:
      - "Ah, but there is, Horatio, there’s a lot of offense. As for this ghost we just saw, he’s a real one, I can tell you that much. But regarding what happened between us, don’t ask—I can’t tell you. And now, my friends, my courageous and educated friends, do me one small favor."

      - "Swear."
    m:
      - "Then give it a nice welcome, as you would give to any stranger. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than you’ve even dreamed of. But now listen to me. No matter how strangely I act (since I may find it appropriate to act a little crazy in the near future), you must never, ever let on—with a gesture of your hands or a certain expression on your face—that you know anything about what happened to me here tonight. You must never say anything like, “Ah, yes, just as we suspected,” or “We could tell you a thing or two about him,” or anything like that. Swear you won’t."
