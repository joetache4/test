<p>When I would pray and think, I think and pray</p>
<p>To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;</p>
<p>Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,</p>
<p>Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,</p>
<p>As if I did but only chew his name;</p>
<p>And in my heart the strong and swelling evil</p>
<p>Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied</p>
<p>Is like a good thing, being often read,</p>
<p>Grown fear’d and tedious; yea, my gravity,</p>
<p>Wherein—let no man hear me—I take pride,</p>
<p>Could I with boot change for an idle plume,</p>
<p>Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,</p>
<p>How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,</p>
<p>Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls</p>
<p>To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:</p>
<p>Let’s write good angel on the devil’s horn:</p>
<p>’Tis not the devil’s crest.</p>

<b>ANGELO</b>
<p>When I try to pray and think, I think and pray about different things. My empty words focus on heaven, while my imagination ignores what I’m saying and fixates on Isabel. It’s as if I’m only mouthing God’s name, while an evil idea grows in my heart. The politics I used to study with such interest now seem dry and tedious. The dignity I was so proud of (I hope no one hears this) is now worth even less than some silly hat feather waving uselessly in the wind. Oh, how often do rank and ceremonial trappings impress the foolish and entrap even the wise! Passions are passions—they cannot simply be swept away. You can write “good angel” on the devil’s horns, but that doesn’t change his devilish nature.</p>

<p>To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,</p>
<p>Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,</p>
<p>That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,</p>
<p>Either of condemnation or approof;</p>
<p>Bidding the law make court’sy to their will:</p>
<p>Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,</p>
<p>To follow as it draws! I’ll to my brother:</p>
<p>Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,</p>
<p>Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.</p>
<p>That, had he twenty heads to tender down</p>
<p>On twenty bloody blocks, he’ld yield them up,</p>
<p>Before his sister should her body stoop</p>
<p>To such abhorr’d pollution.</p>
<p>Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:</p>
<p>More than our brother is our chastity.</p>
<p>I’ll tell him yet of Angelo’s request,</p>
<p>And fit his mind to death, for his soul’s rest.</p>

<b>ISABELLA</b>
<p>Who can I complain to? If I reported this, who would believe me? Oh, dangerous mouths, with double-talking tongues that can both condemn and approve, and make the law bow to their wishes. They put their sexual desires before notions of right and wrong! I’ll go to my brother. Although he gave in to his body’s demands, his mind’s so honorable that, if he had twenty heads to lay on twenty bloody execution blocks, he’d give them all up, rather than let his sister pollute her body. So, Isabel, you’ll live chaste, and brother, you’ll die. My chastity is more important than my brother. I’ll tell him of Angelo’s request, and prepare him for death—and the eternal rest of his soul.</p>
