    m:
      - "Now, by my mother’s son, and that’s me, it will be moon or star or whatever I want before I’ll travel to your father’s house. *(to servants)* Go return our horses.— Constantly contradicted and contradicted, and nothing but contradicted!"

    m:
      - "Then God be praised, it *is* the blessed sun. But it is not the sun when you say it is not, and the moon changes according to your mind. Whatever you want to call a thing, that’s what it is—and that’s what it will always be for me."

    m:
      - "*(to VINCENTIO)* Good morning, young miss, where are you going?—Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly, have you ever seen a young gentlewoman blooming more with health? The way the shades of white and red compete in her complexion. Which of the stars in heaven shine with such beauty as the two eyes that sparkle in that heavenly face? Fair lovely maid, once more good day to you.—Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "*(aside)* He will make the man mad, to make a woman of him."

      - "Happy the parents of so fair a child."
      - "Happier the man whom favorable stars"
      - "Allot thee for his lovely bedfellow!"
    m:
      - "Young budding virgin, fair and pure and sweet, where are you off to? Or where do you live? Your parents are lucky to have such a lovely child. And luckier still is the man who gets to be your husband and share your bed."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad."
      - "This is a man—old, wrinkled, faded, withered—"
      - "And not a maiden, as thou say’st he is."
    m:
      - "Why, dear me, Kate! I hope you haven’t lost your mind. This is not a maiden, as you say, but an old man—wrinkled, faded, and withered."

  - sp: KATHERINE
    o:
      - "Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes"
      - "That have been so bedazzled with the sun"
      - "That everything I look on seemeth green."
      - "Now I perceive thou art a reverend father."
      - "Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking."
    m:
      - "Sir, pardon my imperfect eyes, which have been so blinded by the sun that everything I look at appears green. Now I can see that you’re an elderly gentleman. Do forgive me for my crazy error."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known"
      - "Which way thou travellest. If along with us,"
      - "We shall be joyful of thy company."
    m:
      - "Do, good old grandfather, and while you’re at it, tell us which way you’re traveling. If we’re all headed in the same direction, we’d love your company."

  - sp: VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Fair sir, and you, my merry mistress,"
      - "That with your strange encounter much amazed me,"
      - "My name is called Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,"
      - "And bound I am to Padua, there to visit"
      - "A son of mine which long I have not seen."
    m:
      - "Well, sir, and you, witty lady, who gave me quite a turn with your strange talk, my name is Vincentio, my hometown Pisa, and I am traveling to Padua to visit a son of mine whom I haven’t seen in a long while."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "What is his name?"
    m:
      - "What is his name?"

  - sp: VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "Lucentio, gentle sir."
    m:
      - "Lucentio, sir."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Happily met, the happier for thy son."
      - "And now by law as well as reverend age,"
      - "I may entitle thee my loving father."
      - "The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,"
      - "Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not"
      - "Nor be grieved. She is of good esteem,"
      - "Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth."
      - "Beside, so qualified as may beseem"
      - "The spouse of any noble gentleman."
      - "Let me embrace with old Vincentio,"
      - "And wander we to see thy honest son,"
      - "Who will of thy arrival be full joyous."
    m:
      - "A fortunate coincidence—more fortunate for your son. I can now call you “father” in a legal sense, not just out of respect for your age. The sister of my wife, this lady here, is married to your son. And there’s no need for wonder or worry. His bride is well thought of, with a rich dowry and noble birth—a fit wife for any nobleman. Let me embrace the father of Lucentio, and then we’ll journey on to see your son, who will rejoice at your arrival."

  - sp: VINCENTIO
    o:
      - "But is this true, or is it else your pleasure,"
      - "Like pleasant travelers, to break a jest"
      - "Upon the company you overtake?"
    m:
      - "Is all this true? Or is this your way of livening up your travels—playing jokes on people you meet on the way?"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "I do assure thee, father, so it is."
    m:
      - "I assure you, sir, it’s true."

  - sp: PETRUCHIO
    o:
      - "Come, go along and see the truth hereof,"
      - "For our first merriment hath made thee jealous."
    m:
      - "Look, come along with us and see the truth for yourself. Our earlier joke has made you understandably suspicious."

  - os: "Exeunt all but HORTENSIO"
    ms: "Everyone but HORTENSIO exits."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart."
      - "Have to my widow, and if she be froward,"
      - "Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward."
    m:
      - "Well, Petruchio, all this is very encouraging. I’ll visit my widow now, and if she proves difficult to manage, I’ll know how to make myself impossible."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."
