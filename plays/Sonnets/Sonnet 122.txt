      - "Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain"
      - "Full charactered with lasting memory,"
      - "Which shall above that idle rank remain"
      - "Beyond all date, ev’n to eternity;"
      - "Or at the least, so long as brain and heart"
      - "Have faculty by nature to subsist;"
      - "Till each to razed oblivion yield his part"
      - "Of thee, thy record never can be missed."
      - "That poor retention could not so much hold,"
      - "Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;"
      - "Therefore to give them from me was I bold,"
      - "To trust those tables that receive thee more;"
      - "  To keep an adjunct to remember thee"
      - "  Were to import forgetfulness in me."

      - "In my mind, I’ve already filled up the blank book you gave me with words that will remain in my memory longer than they would in that flimsy little book. In my memory, what I wrote about you will outlast any date, even to eternity. Or at least this record of you won’t be lost as long as my brain and heart survive—until each of them is forced to give up its part of you and pass into oblivion. That poor little notebook couldn’t hold as much as my memory can, and I have no need to keep notes to remember how much I love you. Therefore I was bold enough to give away your notebook, trusting in my own memory to keep a better record of you. For me to use an aid to remember you would imply that I’m forgetful."
