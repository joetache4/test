<p>I pray thee, cease thy counsel,</p>
<p>Which falls into mine ears as profitless</p>
<p>As water in a sieve. Give not me counsel,</p>
<p>Nor let no comforter delight mine ear</p>
<p>But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.</p>
<p>Bring me a father that so loved his child,</p>
<p>Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine,</p>
<p>And bid him speak of patience.</p>
<p>Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,</p>
<p>And let it answer every strain for strain,</p>
<p>As thus for thus and such a grief for such,</p>
<p>In every lineament, branch, shape, and form.</p>
<p>If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,</p>
<p>Bid sorrow wag, cry “hem” when he should groan,</p>
<p>Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk</p>
<p>With candle-wasters, bring him yet to me</p>
<p>And I of him will gather patience.</p>
<p>But there is no such man. For, brother, men</p>
<p>Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief</p>
<p>Which they themselves not feel, but, tasting it,</p>
<p>Their counsel turns to passion which before</p>
<p>Would give preceptial med’cine to rage,</p>
<p>Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,</p>
<p>Charm ache with air, and agony with words.</p>
<p>No, no, ’tis all men’s office to speak patience</p>
<p>To those that wring under the load of sorrow,</p>
<p>But no man’s virtue nor sufficiency</p>
<p>To be so moral when he shall endure</p>
<p>The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel.</p>
<p>My griefs cry louder than advertisement.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>LEONATO</b>
<p>Stop advising me; your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve. Don’t counsel me. Only someone who’s been wronged as I have can comfort me. Find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and ask<em>him</em> to be patient. Compare the length and width of that man’s sadness against my own; match up all the complaints and strong emotions that run through our bodies. If a man who has suffered as I have gave me advice the way you do—smiling and stroking his beard, telling me to toss away my sorrow, giving speeches when he should be wailing with me, trying to heal my grief with little proverbs, spinning my head around with philosophy—then I would take his advice and be patient. But that man doesn’t exist. You can try to comfort a man who feels a pain that you have never felt, but once you feel it too, your sober advice will also turn into passion. You can’t treat madness with rules or bind up insanity with little silken threads or cure heartache with hot air or lighten agony with pat phrases. Every man thinks it’s his duty to advise those who are overwrought with sorrow to be patient. But no man is so moral or so strong that they can endure the same advice when they themselves are grieving. So don’t advise me. My sorrow is crying too loudly to hear what you have to say.</p>

<p>Benedick, Beatrice praised your wit the other day.

He spoke two languages then.” She turned all your virtues into vices just about an hour ago. But in the end she sighed and admitted you were the handsomest man in Italy.</p>
