  - os: "Enter a DOCTOR of physic and a waiting-GENTLEWOMAN"
    ms: "A DOCTOR and a waiting-GENTLEWOMAN enter."

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?"
    m:
      - "I’ve stayed up with you for two nights now, and I haven’t seen any evidence of what you were talking about. When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking?"

  - sp: GENTLEWOMAN
    o:
      - "Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep."
    m:
      - "Since Macbeth went to war, I have seen her rise from her bed, put on her nightgown, unlock her closet, take out some paper, fold it, write on it, read it, seal it up, and then return to bed, remaining asleep the entire time."

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?"
    m:
      - "It’s unnatural to be asleep and act as if you’re awake. When she is like this, besides walking and performing various activities, have you heard her say anything?"

  - sp: GENTLEWOMAN
    o:
      - "That, sir, which I will not report after her."
    m:
      - "She says something, sir, but I will not repeat it to you."

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "You may to me, and ’tis most meet you should."
    m:
      - "You can tell me. You really should."

  - sp: GENTLEWOMAN
    o:
      - "Neither to you nor any one, having no witness to confirm my speech."
    m:
      - "I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else, because there was no one else to witness her speech."

  - os: "Enter LADY MACBETH with a taper"
    ms: "LADY MACBETH enters, holding a candle."

  - o:
      - "Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her, stand close."
    m:
      - "Look, here she comes! This is exactly how she always looks, and—I swear it—she is fast asleep. Watch her. Keep hidden."

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "How came she by that light?"
    m:
      - "How did she get that candle?"

  - sp: GENTLEWOMAN
    o:
      - "Why, it stood by her. She has light by her continually. ’Tis her command."
    m:
      - "It stands by her bedside. She always has to have a light next to her. Those are her orders."

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "You see her eyes are open."
    m:
      - "You see, her eyes are open."

  - sp: GENTLEWOMAN
    o:
      - "Ay, but their sense is shut."
    m:
      - "Yes, but they don’t see anything."

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands."
    m:
      - "What’s she doing now? Look how she rubs her hands."

  - sp: GENTLEWOMAN
    o:
      - "It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour."
    m:
      - "She often does that. She looks like she’s washing her hands. I’ve seen her do that before for as long as fifteen minutes."

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "Yet here’s a spot."
    m:
      - "There’s still a spot here."

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "Hark! She speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly."
    m:
      - "Listen! She’s talking. I’ll write down what she says, so I’ll remember it better."

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "Out, damned spot! Out, I say!—One, two. Why, then, ’tis time to do ’t. Hell is murky!—Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?—Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him."
    m:
      - "*(rubbing her hands)* Come out, damned spot! Out, I command you! One, two. OK, it’s time to do it now.—Hell is murky!—Nonsense, my lord, nonsense! You are a soldier, and yet you are afraid? Why should we be scared, when no one can lay the guilt upon us?—But who would have thought the old man would have had so much blood in him?"

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "Do you mark that?"
    m:
      - "Did you hear that?"

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "The thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What, will these hands ne’er be clean?—No more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that. You mar all with this starting."
    m:
      - "The thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What, will my hands never be clean?—No more of that, my lord, no more of that. You’ll ruin everything by acting startled like this."

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "Go to, go to. You have known what you should not."
    m:
      - "Now look what you’ve done. You’ve heard something you shouldn’t have."

  - sp: GENTLEWOMAN
    o:
      - "She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that. Heaven knows what she has known."
    m:
      - "She said something she shouldn’t have said, I’m sure of that. Heaven knows what secrets she’s keeping."

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "Here’s the smell of the blood still. All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, Oh, Oh!"
    m:
      - "I still have the smell of blood on my hand. All the perfumes of Arabia couldn’t make my little hand smell better. Oh, oh, oh!"

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged."
    m:
      - "What a heavy sigh! Her heart is carrying a heavy weight."

  - sp: GENTLEWOMAN
    o:
      - "I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body."
    m:
      - "I wouldn’t want a heart like hers even if you made me queen."

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "Well, well, well."
    m:
      - "Well, well, well."

  - sp: GENTLEWOMAN
    o:
      - "Pray God it be, sir."
    m:
      - "I hope what she’s saying is well, sir!"

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds."
    m:
      - "This disease is beyond my medical skills. But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren’t guilty of anything."

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown. Look not so pale.—I tell you yet again, Banquo’s buried; he cannot come out on ’s grave."
    m:
      - "Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown. Don’t look so frightened. I tell you again, Banquo is buried. He cannot come out of his grave."

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "Even so?"
    m:
      - "Is this true?"

  - sp: LADY MACBETH
    o:
      - "To bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come. Give me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone.—To bed, to bed, to bed!"
    m:
      - "To bed, to bed! There’s a knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed!"

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "LADY MACBETH exits."

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "Will she go now to bed?"
    m:
      - "Will she go to bed now?"

  - sp: GENTLEWOMAN
    o:
      - "Directly."
    m:
      - "Yes, right away."

  - sp: DOCTOR
    o:
      - "Foul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds"
      - "Do breed unnatural troubles. Infected minds"
      - "To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets."
      - "More needs she the divine than the physician."
      - "God, God forgive us all! Look after her,"
      - "Remove from her the means of all annoyance,"
      - "And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night."
      - "My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight."
      - "I think, but dare not speak."
    m:
      - "Evil rumors are going around. Unnatural acts will cause supernatural things to happen. People with guilty and deranged minds will confess their secrets to their pillows as they sleep. This woman needs a priest more than a doctor. God forgive us all! *(to the waiting- GENTLEWOMAN)* Look after her. Remove anything she might hurt herself with. Watch her constantly. And now, good-night. She has bewildered my mind and amazed my eyes. I have an opinion, but I don’t dare to say it out loud."

  - sp: GENTLEWOMAN
    o:
      - "    Good night, good doctor."
    m:
      - "Good night, good doctor."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
