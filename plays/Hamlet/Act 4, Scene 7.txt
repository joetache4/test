  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,"
      - "And you must put me in your heart for friend,"
      - "Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,"
      - "That he which hath your noble father slain"
      - "Pursued my life."
    m:
      - "Now you’ve got to acknowledge my innocence and believe I’m your friend, since you’ve heard and understood that the man who killed your father was trying to kill me."

  - sp: LAERTES
    o:
      - "  It well appears. But tell me"
      - "Why you proceeded not against these feats,"
      - "So criminal and so capital in nature,"
      - "As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,"
      - "You mainly were stirred up."
    m:
      - "It looks that way. But tell me why you didn’t take immediate action against his criminal acts, when your own safety and everything else would seem to call for it."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "    Oh, for two special reasons,"
      - "Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed,"
      - "But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother"
      - "Lives almost by his looks, and for myself—"
      - "My virtue or my plague, be it either which—"
      - "She’s so conjunctive to my life and soul,"
      - "That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,"
      - "I could not but by her. The other motive"
      - "Why to a public count I might not go,"
      - "Is the great love the general gender bear him,"
      - "Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,"
      - "Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,"
      - "Convert his gyves to graces—so that my arrows,"
      - "Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind,"
      - "Would have reverted to my bow again,"
      - "And not where I had aimed them."
    m:
      - "Oh, for two main reasons which may seem weak to you, but strong to me. The queen, his mother, is devoted to him. And (for better or worse, whichever it is) she is such a part of my life and soul that I can’t live apart from her, any more than a planet can leave its orbit. The other reason why I couldn’t prosecute and arrest Hamlet is that the public loves him. In their affection they overlook all his faults. Like magic, they convert them into virtues, so whatever I said against him would end up hurting me, not him."

  - sp: LAERTES
    o:
      - "And so have I a noble father lost,"
      - "A sister driven into desperate terms,"
      - "Whose worth, if praises may go back again,"
      - "Stood challenger on mount of all the age"
      - "For her perfections. But my revenge will come."
    m:
      - "And so I’ve lost my noble father, had my sister driven insane—my sister who once was (if I can praise her for what she once was, not what she is now) the most perfect girl who ever lived. But I’ll get my revenge."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think"
      - "That we are made of stuff so flat and dull"
      - "That we can let our beard be shook with danger"
      - "And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more."
      - "I loved your father, and we love ourself."
      - "And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine—"
    m:
      - "Don’t you worry about that. You must not think that I’m so lazy and dull that I can be severely threatened and think it’s just a game. You’ll hear more about my plans soon enough. I loved your father, and I love myself, which should be enough to—"

    o:

    o:

      - "They were given me by Claudio. He received them"
      - "Of him that brought them."
    m:
      - "Sailors, my lord, or so they say. I didn’t see them. Claudio gave them to me, and he got them from the one who delivered them."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "Laertes, you shall hear them.—Leave us."
    m:

    m:
      - "*(reads)*"
      - " “High and Mighty one,"
      - "  You know I’ve been set down naked, you might say, in your kingdom. Tomorrow I’ll beg permission to look into your kingly eyes, at which point I’ll tell you the story (after first apologizing) of how I came back to Denmark so strangely and suddenly."
      - "    Hamlet”"

  - o:
      - "What should this mean? Are all the rest come back? Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?"
    m:
      - "What does this mean? Has everyone else come back too? Or is it all a lie—and no one has yet returned?"

    m:
      - "Do you recognize the handwriting?"

    o:
      - "  ’Tis Hamlet’s character. “Naked”?"
      - "And in a postscript here, he says “alone.”"
      - "Can you advise me?"
    m:
      - "It’s Hamlet’s writing. “Naked,” he says. And in a P.S. he adds, “alone.” Can you help me out with this?"

  - sp: LAERTES
    o:
      - "I’m lost in it, my lord. But let him come."
      - "It warms the very sickness in my heart"
      - "That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,"
      - "“Thus diddest thou.”"
    m:
      - "I have no clue, my lord. But let him come. It warms my weary heart to think I’ll get the chance to look him in the eye and say, “You did this.”"

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "  If it be so, Laertes—"
      - "As how should it be so? How otherwise?—"
      - "Will you be ruled by me?"
    m:
      - "If that’s how you feel, Laertes—and why shouldn’t you? Will you let me guide and direct you?"

  - sp: LAERTES
    o:
      - "    Ay, my lord—"
      - "So you will not o’errule me to a peace."
    m:
      - "Yes, my lord, as long as you won’t lead me toward peace."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "To thine own peace. If he be now returned,"
      - "As checking at his voyage, and that he means"
      - "No more to undertake it, I will work him"
      - "To an exploit, now ripe in my devise,"
      - "Under the which he shall not choose but fall."
      - "And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,"
      - "But even his mother shall uncharge the practice"
      - "And call it accident."
    m:
      - "No, just toward your own peace of mind. If he’s come back to Denmark without plans to continue on his trip, then I’ll trick him into an undertaking, which I’m working out now, that’s sure to kill him. When he dies, no one will be blamed, even his mother will call it an accident."

  - sp: LAERTES
    o:
      - "  My lord, I will be ruled"
      - "The rather if you could devise it so"
      - "That I might be the organ."
    m:
      - "My lord, I’ll let you make the decision. I only ask to be in on your plans, the agent of his death."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "    It falls right."
      - "You have been talked of since your travel much—"
      - "And that in Hamlet’s hearing—for a quality"
      - "Wherein, they say, you shine. Your sum of parts"
      - "Did not together pluck such envy from him"
      - "As did that one, and that, in my regard,"
      - "Of the unworthiest siege."
    m:
      - "That’ll be fine. Since you left, people have been talking about—and within earshot of Hamlet—a certain quality of yours in which, they say, you shine. All your talents and gifts didn’t arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did, though to me it’s far from your best attribute."

  - sp: LAERTES
    o:
      - "    What part is that, my lord?"
    m:
      - "What quality is that, my lord?"

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "A very ribbon in the cap of youth,"
      - "Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes"
      - "The light and careless livery that it wears"
      - "Than settled age his sables and his weeds,"
      - "Importing health and graveness. Two months since,"
      - "Here was a gentleman of Normandy."
      - "I’ve seen myself, and served against, the French,"
      - "And they can well on horseback. But this gallant"
      - "Had witchcraft in ’t. He grew unto his seat,"
      - "And to such wondrous doing brought his horse"
      - "As he had been encorpsed and demi-natured"
      - "With the brave beast. So far he topped my thought,"
      - "That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,"
      - "Come short of what he did."
    m:
      - "A trivial little ribbon on the cap of youth—yet an important one, too, since casual clothes suit young people as much as serious business suits and overcoats suit the middle-aged. Two months ago I met a gentleman from Normandy. I’ve fought against the French and have seen how well they ride, but this man was a magician on horseback. It was as if he were part of the horse, so skillful that even having seen him, I can hardly conceive of the tricks he did."

  - sp: LAERTES
    o:
      - "    A Norman was ’t?"
    m:
      - "Hmm, he was from Normandy, you say?"

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "A Norman."
    m:
      - "Yes, from Normandy."

  - sp: LAERTES
    o:
      - "Upon my life, Lamond!"
    m:
      - "I bet it was Lamond."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "    The very same."
    m:
      - "Yes, that’s the one."

  - sp: LAERTES
    o:
      - "I know him well. He is the brooch indeed"
      - "And gem of all the nation."
    m:
      - "I know him well. He’s his homeland’s jewel."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "    He made confession of you,"
      - "And gave you such a masterly report"
      - "For art and exercise in your defense,"
      - "And for your rapier most especially,"
      - "That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed"
      - "If one could match you. The ’scrimers of their nation,"
      - "He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,"
      - "If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his"
      - "Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy"
      - "That he could nothing do but wish and beg"
      - "Your sudden coming o’er, to play with him."
      - "Now, out of this—"
    m:
      - "He mentioned you to me, giving you such high marks in fencing that he exclaimed it would be a miracle if someone could match you. French fencers wouldn’t be good enough for you, he said, since they don’t have the right moves or skills. Hamlet was so jealous when he heard Lamond’s report that he talked about nothing else but having you come over and play against him. Now, the point is …"

  - sp: LAERTES
    o:
      - "  What out of this, my lord?"
    m:
      - "What’s the point, my lord?"

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "Laertes, was your father dear to you?"
      - "Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,"
      - "A face without a heart?"
    m:
      - "Laertes, did you love your father? Or is your grief just an illusion—a mere painting of sorrow?"

  - sp: LAERTES
    o:
      - "    Why ask you this?"
    m:
      - "How could you ask?"

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "Not that I think you did not love your father"
      - "But that I know love is begun by time,"
      - "And that I see, in passages of proof,"
      - "Time qualifies the spark and fire of it."
      - "There lives within the very flame of love"
      - "A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it."
      - "And nothing is at a like goodness still."
      - "For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,"
      - "Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,"
      - "We should do when we would, for this “would” changes"
      - "And hath abatements and delays as many"
      - "As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents."
      - "And then this “should” is like a spendthrift sigh"
      - "That hurts by easing.—But to the quick of th’ ulcer:"
      - "Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake"
      - "To show yourself in deed your father’s son"
      - "More than in words?"
    m:
      - "Not that I suspect you didn’t love your father, but I’ve seen it happen that, as the days go by, time dampens the flame of love. The fire of love always burns itself out, and nothing stays the way it began. Even a good thing can grow too big and die from its own excess. We should do what we intend to do right when we intend it, since our intentions are subject to as many weakenings and delays as there are words in the dictionary and accidents in life. And then all our “woulds” and “shoulds” are nothing but hot air. But back to my point: Hamlet’s coming back. What proof will you offer—in action, not just words—that you’re your father’s son?"

  - sp: LAERTES
    o:
      - "  To cut his throat i’ th’ church."
    m:
      - "I’ll cut Hamlet’s throat in church."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize."
      - "Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,"
      - "Will you do this, keep close within your chamber."
      - "Hamlet returned shall know you are come home."
      - "We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence"
      - "And set a double varnish on the fame"
      - "The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together"
      - "And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,"
      - "Most generous and free from all contriving,"
      - "Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,"
      - "Or with a little shuffling, you may choose"
      - "A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice"
      - "Requite him for your father."
    m:
      - "It’s true, no place—not even a church—should offer refuge to that murderer. Revenge should have no limits. But Laertes, will you do this: stay in your room? When Hamlet comes home he’ll learn you’re here. I’ll have people praise your excellence and put a double coat on the fame the Frenchman gave you. In short, we’ll get you together and place bets on you. Hamlet’s so careless, high-minded, and unsuspecting that he won’t examine the swords beforehand, so you can easily choose one with a sharpened point and in one thrust avenge the death of your father."

  - sp: LAERTES
    o:
      - "    I will do ’t."
      - "And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword."
      - "I bought an unction of a mountebank,"
      - "So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,"
      - "Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,"
      - "Collected from all simples that have virtue"
      - "Under the moon, can save the thing from death"
      - "That is but scratched withal. I’ll touch my point"
      - "With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly"
      - "It may be death."
    m:
      - "I’ll do it, and I’ll put a little dab of something on my sword as well. From a quack doctor I bought some oil so poisonous that if you dip a knife in it, no medicine in the world can save the person who’s scratched by it. If I even graze his skin slightly, he’s likely to die."

  - sp: CLAUDIUS
    o:
      - "  Let’s further think of this,"
      - "Weigh what convenience both of time and means"
      - "May fit us to our shape. If this should fail,"
      - "And that our drift look through our bad performance,"
      - "’Twere better not assayed. Therefore this project"
      - "Should have a back or second that might hold"
      - "If this should blast in proof.—Soft, let me see.—"
      - "We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings.—"
      - "I ha ’t! When in your motion you are hot and dry,"
      - "As make your bouts more violent to that end,"
      - "And that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepared him"
      - "A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,"
      - "If he by chance escape your venomed stuck,"
      - "Our purpose may hold there.—But stay, what noise?"
    m:
      - "Let’s think about this, and consider what time and what method will be most appropriate. If our plan were to fail, and people found out about it, it would be better never to have tried it. We should have a backup ready in case the first plan doesn’t work. Let me think. We’ll place bets on you and Hamlet—that’s it! When the two of you have gotten all sweaty and hot—keep him jumping around a lot for that purpose—Hamlet will ask for something to drink. I’ll have a cup ready for him. If by chance he escapes your poisoned sword tip, the drink will kill him. But wait, what’s that sound?"

      - "Pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay"
      - "To muddy death."
    m:
      - "There’s a willow that leans over the brook, dangling its white leaves over the glassy water. Ophelia made wild wreaths out of those leaves, braiding in crowflowers, thistles, daisies, and the orchises that vulgar shepherds have an obscene name for, but which pure-minded girls call “dead men’s fingers.” Climbing into the tree to hang the wreath of weeds on the hanging branches, she and her flowers fell into the gurgling brook. Her clothes spread out wide in the water, and buoyed her up for a while as she sang bits of old hymns, acting like someone who doesn’t realize the danger she’s in, or like someone completely accustomed to danger. But it was only a matter of time before her clothes, heavy with the water they absorbed, pulled the poor thing out of her song, down into the mud at the bottom of the brook."

      - "The woman will be out.—Adieu, my lord."
      - "I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze,"
      - "But that this folly doubts it."
    m:
      - "You’ve had too much water already, poor Ophelia, so I won’t shed watery tears for you. But crying is what humans do. We do what’s in our nature, even if we’re ashamed of it. After I stop crying I’ll be through acting like a woman. Good-bye, my lord. I have some fiery words I could speak now, but my foolish tears are drowning them out."
