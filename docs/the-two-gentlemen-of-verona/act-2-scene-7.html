<p>Oh, don’t you know that his looks are food for my soul? Pity the famine I’ve endured by being without that food for so long. If you only knew the inner touch of love, you would as soon try to start a fire with snow as you would try to snuff the love’s fire with words.</p>

<p>The more thou damm’st it up, the more it burns.</p>

<p>He makes sweet music with th’ enameled stones,</p>
<p>Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge</p>
<p>He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,</p>
<p>And so by many winding nooks he strays</p>
<p>With willing sport to the wild ocean.</p>
<p>Then let me go, and hinder not my course.</p>
<p>I’ll be as patient as a gentle stream</p>
<p>And make a pastime of each weary step,</p>
<p>Till the last step have brought me to my love,</p>
<p>And there I’ll rest, as after much turmoil</p>
<p>A blessèd soul doth in Elysium.</p>

<b>JULIA</b>
<p>The more you try to smother the fire, the more it burns. A gentle current of water will rage turbulently if blocked, you know. But when the current isn’t hindered, it makes a sweet noise over the smooth, shiny stones, giving a gentle kiss to every blade of sedge grass that it passes over on its journey. And so it wanders past many curvy nooks as it heads playfully to the wild ocean. So let me go, and don’t hinder my course. I’ll be as patient as a gentle stream and enjoy each tiring step, until the last step has brought me to my love. There I’ll rest, just like a blessed soul rests in Elysium after a tumultuous life.</p>
