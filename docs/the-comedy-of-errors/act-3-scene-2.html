<p>And may it be that you have quite forgot</p>
<p>A husband’s office? Shall, Antipholus,</p>
<p>Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot?</p>
<p>Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?</p>
<p>If you did wed my sister for her wealth,</p>
<p>Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness.</p>
<p>Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth—</p>
<p>Muffle your false love with some show of blindness.</p>
<p>Let not my sister read it in your eye;</p>
<p>Be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator;</p>
<p>Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;</p>
<p>Apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger.</p>
<p>Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted.</p>
<p>Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint.</p>
<p>Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?</p>
<p>What simple thief brags of his own attaint?</p>
<p>’Tis double wrong to truant with your bed</p>
<p>And let her read it in thy looks at board.</p>
<p>Shame hath a bastard fame, well managèd;</p>
<p>Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.</p>
<p>Alas, poor women, make us but believe,</p>
<p>Being compact of credit, that you love us.</p>
<p>Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;</p>
<p>We in your motion turn, and you may move us.</p>
<p>Then, gentle brother, get you in again.</p>
<p>Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.</p>
<p>’Tis holy sport to be a little vain</p>
<p>When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.</p>

<p>Have you completely forgotten your duty as a husband? Antipholus, your marriage is still fresh and new, like the springtime—have the young shoots of your love already started to wither? Is the building of your love already in ruins? If you married my sister for her wealth, then for her wealth’s sake, treat her with more kindness. Or if your affection has already strayed to another woman, at least be stealthy about it. Hide your false love, blindfold yourself so my sister cannot read your faithlessness in your eyes. Watch what you say, and don’t let your own words give away your shame. Look sweet and act kindly—be attractive in your disloyalty. Disguise your misbehavior as integrity, and behave properly even if your heart is tainted. Though you are sinful, carry yourself like a holy saint. Be false in secret: why does she need to know? What foolish thief brags about his crimes? It’s doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes. When you do something shameful, it’s possible to put a good spin on it, but bad deeds are made worse by speaking of them. Alas, poor women! We’re so gullible, we believe it when you say you love us. Even if you love someone else in your heart, make it appear as if you love us. We follow in your orbit, and you have the power to move us. So, my sweet brother-in-law, go inside. Comfort my sister, cheer her up, call her “wife.” It’s a holy thing to lie a little when sweet flattery can smooth over trouble.</p>

<p>Sweet mistress—what your name is else I know not,</p>
<p>Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,—</p>
<p>Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not</p>
<p>Than our earth’s wonder, more than earth divine.</p>
<p>Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak.</p>
<p>Lay open to my earthy gross conceit,</p>
<p>Smothered in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,</p>
<p>The folded meaning of your words’ deceit.</p>
<p>Against my soul’s pure truth why labour you</p>
<p>To make it wander in an unknown field?</p>
<p>Are you a god? would you create me new?</p>
<p>Transform me, then, and to your power I’ll yield.</p>
<p>But if that I am I, then well I know</p>
<p>Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,</p>
<p>Nor to her bed no homage do I owe.</p>
<p>Far more, far more, to you do I decline.</p>
<p>O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note</p>
<p>To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears.</p>
<p>Sing, Siren, for thyself, and I will dote.</p>
<p>Spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs,</p>
<p>And as a bed I’ll take them and there lie,</p>
<p>And in that glorious supposition think</p>
<p>He gains by death that hath such means to die.</p>
<p>Let Love, being light, be drownèd if she sink.</p>

<b>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
<p>Sweet mistress—I don’t know what other name to give you, or how you’ve figured out mine—you seem as wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine. Teach me how I should think and speak. My understanding is clumsy and human, riddled with errors—it is feeble, shallow, and weak. Reveal to me the hidden meaning of your words. Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction? Are you a god? Are you trying to remake me? Go ahead, I’ll yield to your power. But if I am myself, then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife. I don’t owe her any duty—it’s you that I submit to. Oh, sweet mermaid, don’t command me to drown myself in the flood of your sister’s tears. Siren, use your song to make me love you instead, and I will obey. Spread your golden hair over the silver waves, and I will lie down in it like a bed. If a man could die in that glorious fantasy, then I think he would benefit by dying. Love is light and therefore floats—if my love is false, let me sink!</p>

<p>I’ll stop mine ears against the mermaid’s song.</p>

<b>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
<p>Everyone who lives here is a witch. That means it’s high time for me to go. That woman who claims I am her husband—I loathe her in my soul. But her gorgeous sister, who’s so lovely and gracious, who’s so charming and who speaks so well, almost makes me want to stay here against my better judgment. I’d better stop up my ears against this siren’s song.</p>

<p>What I should think of this I cannot tell,</p>
<p>But this I think: there’s no man is so vain</p>
<p>That would refuse so fair an offered chain.</p>
<p>I see a man here needs not live by shifts</p>
<p>When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.</p>
<p>I’ll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay.</p>
<p>If any ship put out, then straight away.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
<p>I don’t know what to think about this. But what I do think is that nobody in his right mind would refuse to accept such a beautiful necklace when somebody offers it. I guess there’s no need to be a thief in Ephesus. People come up to you in the street and hand you gold. I’ll go wait for Dromio at the marketplace. If any ships are sailing, I’ll get right on one.</p>
