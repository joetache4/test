<p>’Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here,</p>
<p>Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog</p>

<p>Live here in heaven and may look on her,</p>
<p>But Romeo may not. More validity,</p>
<p>More honorable state, more courtship lives</p>
<p>In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize</p>
<p>On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand</p>
<p>And steal immortal blessing from her lips,</p>
<p>Who even in pure and vestal modesty,</p>
<p>Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.</p>

<p>Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.</p>

<p>No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,</p>

<p>Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,</p>
<p>Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,</p>
<p>A sin-absolver, and my friend professed,</p>
<p>To mangle me with that word “banishèd”?</p>

<b>ROMEO</b>
<p>It’s torture, not mercy. Heaven is here because Juliet lives here. Every cat and dog and little mouse, every unworthy animal that lives here can see her, but Romeo can’t. Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo. They can take hold of Juliet’s wonderful white hand and they can kiss her sweet lips. Even while she remains a pure virgin, she blushes when her lips touch each other because she thinks it’s a sin. But Romeo can’t kiss her or hold her hand because he’s been banished. Flies can kiss her, but I must flee the city. Flies are like free men, but I have been banished. And yet you say that exile is not death? Did you have no poison, no sharp knife, no weapon you could use to kill me quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except banishment? Oh Friar, damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell. They howl about banishment. If you’re a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins, and you say you’re my friend, how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment?</p>

<b>FRIAR LAWRENCE</b>
<p>Hold on, and don’t act out of desperation. Are you a man? You look like a man, but your tears make you look like a woman. Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast. You’re a shameful woman who looks like a man or else an ugly creature who’s half-man, half-beast. You have amazed me. I swear by my holy order, I thought you were smarter and more rational than this. Have you killed Tybalt? Will you kill yourself? And would you also kill your wife, who shares your life, by committing the sin of killing yourself? Why do you complain about your birth, the heavens, and the earth? Life is the union of soul in body through the miracle of birth, but you would throw all that away. You bring shame to your body, your love, and your mind. You have so much natural talent, but like someone who hoards money, you use none of your talent for the right purpose—not your body, not your love, not your mind. Your body is just a wax figure, without the honor of a man. The love that you promised was a hollow lie. You’re killing the love that you vowed to cherish. Your mind, which aids both your body and your love, has mishandled both of them. You’re like a stupid soldier whose gunpowder explodes because he’s careless. The things you were supposed to use to defend yourself end up killing you. Get up, man! Your Juliet is alive. It was for her that you were almost killed earlier. Be happy that she’s alive. Tybalt wanted to kill you, but you killed Tybalt. Be happy that you’re alive. The law that threatened your life was softened into exile. Be happy about that. Your life is full of blessings. You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy. But like a misbehaved, sullen girl, you’re whining about your bad luck and your love. Listen, listen, people who act like that die miserable. Go be with your love, as it was decided at your wedding. Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her. But get out of there before the night watchmen take their positions. Then you will escape to the city of Mantua, where you’ll live until we can make your marriage public and make peace between your families. We’ll ask the Prince to pardon you. Then we’ll welcome you back with twenty thousand times more joy than you’ll have when you leave this town crying. Go ahead, Nurse. Give my regards to your lady, and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed. I’m sure they’re all so sad that they’ll be ready to sleep. Romeo is coming.</p>

<b>FRIAR LAWRENCE</b>
<p>Now get out of here. Good night. Everything depends on this: either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions, or leave in disguise after daybreak. Take a little vacation in Mantua. I’ll find your servant, and he’ll update you now and then on your case as it stands here. Give me your hand. It’s late. Farewell. Good night.</p>

<p>It were a grief so brief to part with thee.</p>

<p>I’m off to experience the greatest joy of all, but still it’s sad to leave you in such a rush. Farewell.</p>
