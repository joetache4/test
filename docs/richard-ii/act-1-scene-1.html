<p>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</p>

<b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b>
<p>First, may heaven be my witness! I’ve come here as an accuser because I am a devoted subject who cares for the safety of my prince, not because of any other prejudice against the duke. Now, Thomas Mowbray, I will turn to you. Pay attention to this. I will prove that what I am about to say is true, either with my body here on earth or with my immortal soul in heaven. You are a traitor and a villain, born into too good a family to be so and too bad to live. The more beautiful the sky, the uglier the clouds look.

<p>The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,</p>
<p>Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;</p>
<p>The blood is hot that must be cool’d for this:</p>
<p>Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</p>
<p>As to be hush’d and nought at all to say:</p>
<p>First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me</p>
<p>From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;</p>
<p>Which else would post until it had return’d</p>

<p>Which to maintain I would allow him odds,</p>
<p>And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</p>
<p>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</p>
<p>Or any other ground inhabitable,</p>

<p>Don’t let my calm words cast doubt on my loyalty. I know that angry words will not settle this argument, so I’ll try to keep myself under control. But I can’t be so calm as to not say anything in my own defense. First, my respect for you, my king, prevents me from saying what I want and throwing those charges of treason right back at Bolingbroke. I defy him and spit on him as if he weren’t your relative, my lord. He’s a trash-talking coward and a villain, and I’d back up those charges in a duel, even if I gave him an advantage by handicapping myself. For now, I’ve defended my loyalty and made it known that he lies.</p>

<p>Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;</p>
<p>That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles</p>
<p>In name of lendings for your highness’ soldiers,</p>
<p>The which he hath detain’d for lewd employments,</p>
<p>Like a false traitor and injurious villain.</p>
<p>Besides I say and will in battle prove,</p>
<p>Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</p>
<p>That ever was survey’d by English eye,</p>
<p>That all the treasons for these eighteen years</p>
<p>Complotted and contrived in this land</p>
<p>Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</p>
<p>Further I say and further will maintain</p>
<p>Upon his bad life to make all this good,</p>
<p>That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester’s death,</p>
<p>Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</p>
<p>And consequently, like a traitor coward,</p>
<p>Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:</p>
<p>Which blood, like sacrificing Abel’s, cries,</p>
<p>Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</p>
<p>To me for justice and rough chastisement;</p>
<p>And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</p>
<p>This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b>
<p>I’ll prove with my life that what I say is true. Mowbray has received eight thousand gold coins that he was supposed to pay to your soldiers as advances on their wages. But he’s used the money improperly, just like a traitor and harmful villain would. Even more, I declare and will prove in battle that all treasonous plots over the past eighteen years originated with Mowbray. And further, I know that he caused the death of the Duke of Gloucester by encouraging the duke’s easily influenced enemies, like any coward would, to slay the innocent duke. The duke was murdered like Abel, and his blood demands that I seek revenge and justice. By my own good name, I’ll inflict that justice on Mowbray or die trying.</p>

<p>Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,</p>
<p>Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.</p>
<p>Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais</p>
<p>Disbursed I duly to his highness’ soldiers;</p>
<p>The other part reserved I by consent,</p>
<p>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt</p>
<p>Upon remainder of a dear account,</p>
<p>Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:</p>
<p>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester’s death,</p>
<p>I slew him not; but to my own disgrace</p>
<p>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</p>
<p>For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</p>
<p>The honourable father to my foe</p>
<p>Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</p>
<p>A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul</p>
<p>But ere I last received the sacrament</p>
<p>I did confess it, and exactly begg’d</p>
<p>Your grace’s pardon, and I hope I had it.</p>
<p>This is my fault: as for the rest appeall’d,</p>
<p>It issues from the rancour of a villain,</p>
<p>A recreant and most degenerate traitor</p>
<p>Which in myself I boldly will defend;</p>
<p>And interchangeably hurl down my gage</p>
<p>Upon this overweening traitor’s foot,</p>
<p>To prove myself a loyal gentleman</p>

<p>Your highness to assign our trial day.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>THOMAS MOWBRAY</b>
<p>Then, Bolingbroke, you lie from your heart up through your false throat. I gave three quarters of the money I received to the king’s soldiers. The other quarter I had permission to keep, because I was owed the money for my service in going to fetch the queen from France. Now take back your lie. As for Gloucester, I didn’t kill him, but I admit I disgracefully neglected my duty. I once laid in wait to kill you, my noble lord of Lancaster, the father of my enemy. It was a terrible sin and troubles me greatly. But I confessed it already and specifically begged your pardon, and I hoped you had forgiven me. That is my fault. As for the rest of the charges, they come from a villain’s evil nature, and I’ll defend myself against this faithless and cowardly traitor. I’ll throw my glove down onto this arrogant traitor’s foot, and I’ll show that I’m loyal even compared to this member of the royal bloodline. I therefore pray that your highness will assign a day for our duel soon.</p>
