  - os: "Enter KENT disguised and GENTLEMAN"
    ms: "KENT enters in disguise, along with the GENTLEMAN."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason?"
    m:
      - "Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home?"

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "Something he left imperfect in the state which, since his coming forth, is thought of; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary."
    m:
      - "He’d left some unfinished business, which he remembered after arriving here. It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Who hath he left behind him general?"
    m:
      - "Whom did he leave in charge here?"

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "The Marshal of France, Monsieur la Far."
    m:
      - "The marshal of France, Monsieur la Far."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?"
    m:
      - "Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered?"

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,"
      - "And now and then an ample tear trilled down"
      - "Her delicate cheek. It seemed she was a queen"
      - "Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,"
      - "Sought to be king o’er her."
    m:
      - "Yes, sir. She took the letters and read them in front of me. Now and then a large tear trickled down her delicate cheek. She seemed to be trying to control her emotions, which were overwhelming her."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "  O, then it moved her?"
    m:
      - "So she was moved by it?"

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove"
      - "Who should express her goodliest. You have seen"
      - "Sunshine and rain at once—her smiles and tears"
      - "Were like a better way. Those happy smilets"
      - "That played on her ripe lip seemed not to know"
      - "What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence"
      - "As pearls from diamonds dropped. In brief,"
      - "Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved"
      - "If all could so become it."
    m:
      - "There were no outbursts. She was struggling between emotion and self-control. You’ve seen how it can rain while the sun shines? That’s how she was, smiling and crying at once, only more lovely. The little smile on her full lips didn’t seem aware of the tears that were dropping like diamonds from her pearly eyes. If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow, then sorrow would be highly prized."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "  Made she no verbal question?"
    m:
      - "She didn’t ask anything?"

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of “father”"
      - "Pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart,"
      - "Cried, “Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies, sisters!"
      - "Kent, father, sisters! What, i’ th’ storm, i’ th’ night?"
      - "Let pity not be believed.” There she shook"
      - "The holy water from her heavenly eyes,"
      - "And clamor moistened. Then away she started"
      - "To deal with grief alone."
    m:
      - "Actually, once or twice she sighed and said, “father,” as if the word were pressing on her chest. Once she exclaimed, “Sisters, sisters, shame on you! Kent, father, sisters! What, out in a storm in the middle of the night? I can’t believe it.” The tears fell from her eyes like holy water. Then she ran away to grieve alone."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "  It is the stars,"
      - "The stars above us, govern our conditions."
      - "Else one self mate and mate could not beget"
      - "Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?"
    m:
      - "It must be fate that makes us who we are—otherwise someone as good as Cordelia could not possibly be related to those two witches. Have you not spoken to her since then?"

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "No."
    m:
      - "No."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Was this before the king returned?"
    m:
      - "Did this happen before the King of France returned home?"

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "    No, since."
    m:
      - "No, afterward."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Well, sir, the poor distressèd Lear’s i’ th’ town,"
      - "Who sometime in his better tune remembers"
      - "What we are come about, and by no means"
      - "Will yield to see his daughter."
    m:
      - "Well, sir, poor delirious Lear is in town. Sometimes when he’s lucid he remembers why we’re here, and absolutely refuses to see his daughter."

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "    Why, good sir?"
    m:
      - "Why, good sir?"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "A sovereign shame so elbows him. His own unkindness"
      - "That stripped her from his benediction turned her"
      - "To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights"
      - "To his dog-hearted daughters. These things sting"
      - "His mind so venomously that burning shame"
      - "Detains him from Cordelia."
    m:
      - "He’s too overwhelmed with shame. He remembers how unkind he was to her, how he disowned her and sent her abroad, how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters. All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia."

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "    Alack, poor gentleman!"
    m:
      - "Oh, the poor man!"

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?"
    m:
      - "Have you heard about Albany’s and Cornwall’s troops?"

  - sp: GENTLEMAN
    o:
      - "’Tis so. They are afoot."
    m:
      - "I have. They’re on the march."

  - sp: KENT
    o:
      - "Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear"
      - "And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause"
      - "Will in concealment wrap me up awhile."
      - "When I am known aright you shall not grieve"
      - "Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go"
      - "Along with me."
    m:
      - "Well, sir, I’ll take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while. I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer. When I’ve revealed my true identity, you’ll be glad you took the time to help me out. Please come with me."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
