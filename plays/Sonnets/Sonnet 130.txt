      - "My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun;"
      - "Coral is far more red than her lips’ red;"
      - "If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;"
      - "If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head;"
      - "I have seen roses damasked, red and white,"
      - "But no such roses see I in her cheeks;"
      - "And in some pérfumes is there more delight"
      - "Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks."
      - "I love to hear her speak, yet well I know"
      - "That music hath a far more pleasing sound."
      - "I grant I never saw a goddess go;"
      - "My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground."
      - "  And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare"
      - "  As any she belied with false compare."

      - "My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun. Coral is much redder than the red of her lips. Compared to the whiteness of snow, her breasts are grayish-brown. Poets describe their mistresses’ hair as gold wires, but my mistress has *black* wires growing on her head. I have seen roses that were a mixture of red and white, but I don’t see those colors in her cheeks. And some perfumes smell more delightful than my mistress’ reeking breath. I love to hear her speak; yet I know perfectly well that music has a far more pleasant sound. I admit I never saw a goddess walk; when my mistress walks, she treads on the ground. And yet, by heaven, I think my beloved is as special as any woman whom poets have lied about with false comparisons."
