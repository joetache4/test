<b>POLONIUS</b>
<p>Excellent, very good. Ask around and find out what Danish people are in Paris—who they are, where they live and how much money they have, who their friends are. And if you find out in this general sort of questioning that they happen to know my son, you’ll find out much more than if you asked specific questions about him. Just tell them you vaguely know Laertes, say something like, “I’m a friend of his father and I sort of know him,” or whatever. Do you get what I’m saying, Reynaldo?</p>

<p>You should say, “I sort of know him, but not well. Is it the same Laertes who’s a wild party animal? Isn’t he the one who’s always,” and so on.

<p>Mark you, your party in converse, him you would sound,</p>
<p>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</p>

<p>He closes with you in this consequence:</p>
<p>“Good sir” or so, or “Friend,” or “Gentleman,”</p>
<p>According to the phrase or the addition</p>
<p>Of man and country.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>POLONIUS</b>
<p>Well, here’s what I’m thinking. (I’m quite proud of myself for coming up with this.) As you talk with someone and hint about my son’s faults and little sins, you’ll watch his reaction, and if he’s ever seen Laertes do any of these things, it will only be natural for him to agree with you, at which point he’ll call you “sir,” or “my good friend,” depending on who the person is, where he comes from, and so on.</p>

<p>Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth.</p>
<p>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</p>

<b>POLONIUS</b>
<p>“It will be natural for him to agree with you.” Ah, yes, that’s right. If he agrees he’ll say something like this: “Yes, I know the gentleman you’re referring to. I just saw him yesterday,” or “the other day,” or whenever it is, you know, “and there he was gambling,” or “there he was, totally wasted, or fighting with somebody about a tennis match, or going into a house of ill repute”—that means a whorehouse, you know—or whatever. Make sure your little lie brings out the truth. We’re doing this wisely and intelligently, indirectly, finding out things by roundabout means. That’s how you’ll find out what my son is up to in Paris. You get my point, don’t you?</p>
