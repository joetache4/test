<p>The senators alone of this great world,</p>
<p>Chief factors for the gods: I do not know</p>
<p>Wherefore my father should revengers want,</p>
<p>Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,</p>
<p>Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,</p>
<p>There saw you laboring for him. What was ’t</p>
<p>That moved pale Cassius to conspire? And what</p>
<p>Made the all-honored, honest Roman Brutus,</p>
<p>With the armed rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,</p>
<p>To drench the Capitol, but that they would</p>
<p>Have one man but a man? And that is it</p>
<p>Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden</p>
<p>The angered ocean foams, with which I meant</p>
<p>To scourge th’ ingratitude that despiteful Rome</p>
<p>Cast on my noble father.</p>

<b>POMPEY</b>
<p>I address the three of you, the sole rulers of this world and the main arbiters of the gods’ will. I don’t know why my father’s death shouldn’t be avenged, since he has a son and friends to do it. You avenged Julius Caesar’s death at Philippi, where his ghost haunted his killer, Brutus. Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar? And why did the honorable, well-intentioned Brutus and the others, men devoted to the ideal of freedom, assassinate Caesar? They didn’t want one man to be king in Rome. And that’s why I’ve built my navy, which is so huge that the weight of the ships makes the sea foam with anger. I will punish Rome for her ingratitude toward my noble father.</p>
