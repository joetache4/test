<p>That skins the vice o’ the top. Go to your bosom;</p>
<p>Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know</p>
<p>That’s like my brother’s fault: if it confess</p>
<p>A natural guiltiness such as is his,</p>
<p>Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue</p>

<p>Because people in authority, even though they sin like everyone else, apply a sort of bandage to cover—but not cure—their sinful sores. Look in your heart and ask yourself if you’ve ever experienced anything like my brother’s crime. If your heart admits to being guilty of the same natural impulses, don’t say a word to condemn my brother.</p>

<p>From thee, even from thy virtue!</p>
<p>What’s this, what’s this? Is this her fault or mine?</p>
<p>The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I</p>
<p>That, lying by the violet in the sun,</p>
<p>Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,</p>
<p>Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be</p>
<p>That modesty may more betray our sense</p>
<p>Than woman’s lightness? Having waste ground enough,</p>
<p>Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary</p>
<p>And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!</p>
<p>What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?</p>
<p>Dost thou desire her foully for those things</p>
<p>That make her good? O, let her brother live!</p>
<p>Thieves for their robbery have authority</p>
<p>When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,</p>
<p>That I desire to hear her speak again,</p>
<p>And feast upon her eyes? What is’t I dream on?</p>
<p>O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,</p>
<p>With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous</p>
<p>Is that temptation that doth goad us on</p>
<p>To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,</p>
<p>With all her double vigour, art and nature,</p>
<p>Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid</p>
<p>Subdues me quite. Even till now,</p>
<p>When men were fond, I smiled and wonder’d how.</p>

<b>ANGELO</b>
<p>From you, and from your virtue, too! What’s happening? Is this her fault or mine? The tempter or the tempted, who sins the most? Ha! It’s not her, she’s not trying to be a tempter. It’s me. It’s like I’m lying in a field of violets, only instead of blossoming and smelling like a flower, I’m rotting and stinking like a corpse from the same sun that makes the flowers grow. Is it possible that a modest woman can arouse desire more than a seductive one? Having destroyed enough land already, should a person want to tear down a holy place and establish evil there as well? Oh, damn, damn, damn! Angelo, what are you doing, who are you? Do you sinfully desire her for the things that make her good? Oh, I should let her brother live! Thieves are justified in robbing when the judges themselves are thieves. Can it be I’m in love with her, when I want to hear her speak again, and gaze into her eyes? What am I dreaming of? Oh, the devil’s a cunning enemy—to catch a saint, he baits the hook with saints! The most dangerous temptation is the one that uses our love of goodness to draw us into sin. A prostitute could never attract me, even with her two powers: her seductive skills and her natural endowments. But this virtuous girl totally overwhelms me. Whenever I saw men who were infatuated like idiots, I smiled and didn’t understand—up until now.</p>
