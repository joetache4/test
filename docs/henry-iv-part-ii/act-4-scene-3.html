<p>Now, my lords: if God grants us a victory in this violent civil war that bleeds at our very doorsteps, I will lead our young people in a greater cause, and fight nothing but holy wars. Our navy is ready, our army is assembled, the leaders who are my subordinates have their orders, and everything is standing by to achieve my main aim. The only drawback is that I’m feeling a little weak. So let’s wait a short while, until the rebels, now on the run, are brought back in line and are made obedient again.</p>

<p>Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.</p>
<p>How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother?</p>
<p>He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas.</p>
<p>Thou hast a better place in his affection</p>
<p>Than all thy brothers. Cherish it, my boy,</p>
<p>And noble offices thou mayst effect</p>
<p>Of mediation, after I am dead,</p>
<p>Between his greatness and thy other brethren.</p>
<p>Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,</p>
<p>Nor lose the good advantage of his grace</p>
<p>By seeming cold or careless of his will.</p>
<p>For he is gracious if he be observed;</p>
<p>He hath a tear for pity and a hand</p>
<p>Open as day for melting charity;</p>
<p>Yet notwithstanding, being incensed he is flint,</p>
<p>As humorous as winter, and as sudden</p>
<p>As flaws congealed in the spring of day.</p>
<p>His temper therefore must be well observed.</p>
<p>Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,</p>
<p>When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;</p>
<p>But, being moody, give him time and scope</p>
<p>Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,</p>
<p>Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,</p>
<p>And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,</p>
<p>A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,</p>
<p>That the united vessel of their blood,</p>
<p>Mingled with venom of suggestion</p>
<p>(As, force perforce, the age will pour it in),</p>
<p>Shall never leak, though it do work as strong</p>
<p>As aconitum or rash gunpowder.</p>

<b>KING</b>
<p>Only good things for you, Thomas. Why aren’t you with the Prince, your brother? He loves you and you are neglecting him. He cares more about you than any of his other brothers, Thomas; cherish that fact, my boy. After I’m dead, you’ll be in a strong position to help maintain good relations between Prince Hal and his brothers. So don’t ignore him. Don’t turn away his love, and don’t ruin your good relationship with him by seeming cold or distant. He’s kind if he gets his way; he has compassion for others, and he’s generous with charity. But despite all this, once he gets angry, he becomes like a stone. He can be as tempestuous as winter, and can change himself as suddenly as snowflakes at dawn can turn to hail. So watch his temper. When he does something wrong, let him know it—gently, and when he’s in a happy mood. But when he’s ornery, give him room. Wait till his bad mood works itself out, like a beached whale that kills itself by struggling to return to sea. If you can do this, you’ll be a shelter for your friends, and a golden chain that links your brothers together. Once they’re united, the poison of criticism and rumor—which in this day and age is sure to be aimed at them—can’t do them any harm, no matter how explosive and destructive it may be.</p>

<p>My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite.</p>
<p>The Prince but studies his companions</p>

<p>’Tis needful that the most immodest word</p>
<p>Be looked upon and learned; which, once attained,</p>
<p>Your Highness knows, comes to no further use</p>
<p>But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,</p>
<p>The Prince will, in the perfectness of time,</p>
<p>Cast off his followers, and their memory</p>
<p>Shall as a pattern or a measure live,</p>
<p>By which his Grace must mete the lives of others,</p>
<p>Turning past evils to advantages.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>WARWICK</b>
<p>Your highness, you’ve got him all wrong. The Prince is only studying his criminal companions, the way one studies a foreign language. In order to truly learn a language, one must learn even the most immodest curse word—which, as you know, is only learned in order to be identified and, thereafter, avoided. So, like vulgar language, the Prince will get rid of his followers when the time is right. Then they’ll live on in his memory as guidelines, by which he’ll judge the conduct of others. In this sense, he’ll change his past bad deeds to good ends.</p>

Oh, you crown! When you pinch the person wearing you, you’re like a great suit of armor worn on a hot day—you burn the person you’re protecting. There’s a feather near my father’s lips, and it’s not moving: if he were breathing, that light, weightless thing would move. My gracious lord! Father! This is a deep sleep indeed—this is a sleep that has removed the golden ring from the heads of many English kings. Father, I owe you tears and a deep grief, and my love, the bonds of family, and a son’s tender feelings will make sure that I pay you lavishly. Your debt to me is this kingly crown, which I am owed as your heir-apparent. <em>(he puts the crown on his head)</em> Look, here it sits, and God will guard it. Even if all the strength in the world were gathered into a single, giant arm, it wouldn’t be able to force this inherited honor from me. I will leave this to my son as you’ve left it to me.</p>

Oh you foolish youth! You long for power that will end up overwhelming you. Wait a little while. What power I have left is held together so weakly that the lightest breeze would blow it away: my life is fading. You stole something from me that would freely have been yours in just a few hours. On my deathbed, you’ve confirmed all my expectations. All your life you showed that you didn’t love me, and now I will die certain of it. There are a thousand daggers in your thoughts, which you’ve sharpened on your stony heart with the hopes of stabbing me in the little time I have left. What? Couldn’t you endure me for half an hour? Then go and dig my grave yourself, and ring the bells to mark your coronation, not my death. Let all the tears that should be shed on my hearse be drops of holy water to bless your head. Just mix me up with the forgotten dust, and give my body—which gave you life—to the worms. Fire my officers, undo my laws; for now the time has come to jeer at authority. Henry the Fifth is crowned: up with foolishness! Down with decorum! Be gone, all you wise advisers! Assemble lazy apes from every region, and make them the royal court of England! Now, you neighboring countries, get rid of your scum. Do you have a criminal who swears, drinks, dances, parties all night, robs, murders, and commits the oldest sins in the newest ways? Then be happy: that man won’t trouble you any longer. England will paint over his guilt with gold. England will give him a position, honor, power. Because Henry the Fifth has removed the barriers to anarchy: he’s taken the restraining muzzle off the dog of misbehavior, and that wild dog will sink his teeth into the flesh of every decent person. Oh my poor kingdom, sick from this civil war! When all my hard work couldn’t keep disorder at bay, what will you do when disorder becomes your caretaker? Oh, you’ll be a wilderness again, and all the wolves who lived here once will once again be your only citizens.</p>

<p>O pardon me, my liege! But for my tears,</p>
<p>The moist impediments unto my speech,</p>
<p>I had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke</p>
<p>Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard</p>
<p>The course of it so far. There is your crown,</p>
<p>And He that wears the crown immortally</p>
<p>Long guard it yours. If I affect it more</p>
<p>Than as your honor and as your renown,</p>
<p>Let me no more from this obedience rise,</p>
<p>Which my most inward true and duteous spirit</p>
<p>Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending.</p>
<p>God witness with me, when I here came in</p>
<p>And found no course of breath within your Majesty,</p>
<p>How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,</p>
<p>O, let me in my present wildness die</p>
<p>And never live to show th’ incredulous world</p>
<p>The noble change that I have purposèd.</p>
<p>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</p>
<p>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,</p>
<p>I spake unto this crown as having sense,</p>
<p>And thus upbraided it: “The care on thee depending</p>
<p>Hath fed upon the body of my father;</p>
<p>Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold.</p>
<p>Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,</p>
<p>Preserving life in med’cine potable;</p>
<p>But thou, most fine, most honored, most renowned,</p>
<p>Hast eat thy bearer up.” Thus, my most royal liege,</p>
<p>Accusing it, I put it on my head</p>
<p>To try with it, as with an enemy</p>
<p>That had before my face murdered my father,</p>
<p>The quarrel of a true inheritor.</p>
<p>But if it did infect my blood with joy</p>
<p>Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride,</p>
<p>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine</p>
<p>Did with the least affection of a welcome</p>
<p>Give entertainment to the might of it,</p>
<p>Let God forever keep it from my head</p>
<p>And make me as the poorest vassal is</p>
<p>That doth with awe and terror kneel to it.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>PRINCE HENRY</b>
<p>Oh forgive me, your highness. If it weren’t for these tears—which are impeding my speech—I would have stopped this harsh scolding before you, in your grief, had spoken and before I had listened so long. There’s your crown. May God, who wears the crown eternally, guard it as yours for a long time. If I care for the crown in any way other than as a symbol of your honor and reputation, let me never rise from this kneeling position. It is my deepest and most dutiful feelings which teach my body to bend and bow to you, causing my outer body to reflect my inner feelings. May God be my witness: when I came in here and saw that you weren’t breathing, my blood ran cold. If I’m lying, may I die as the wild youth I was before, and never live to show the dubious world the transformation I have been planning. Coming to see you, thinking you were dead—and being nearly dead myself, just thinking that you were—I spoke to this crown as though it were alive. I scolded it like this: “The worry you’ve caused has eaten my father alive. So you, the best piece of gold, are actually the worst piece of gold. Other gold, perhaps worth less, is more precious, since it at least brings us health when mixed in our drinks. But you—the best, the most honored, the most famous—have consumed the person wearing you.” And as I accused it, I put it on my head, to fight against it as an enemy who’d killed my father before my very eyes. It was the fight of a loyal child. But may God keep it from me forever—making me like the poorest servant bowing down before it in awe and terror—if it in any way made me happy or arrogant, or if any part of me was the least bit pleased to welcome it and the power it brings.</p>

<p>O my son,</p>
<p>God put it in thy mind to take it hence</p>

<p>Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed</p>

<p>I met this crown, and I myself know well</p>
<p>How troublesome it sat upon my head.</p>
<p>To thee it shall descend with better quiet,</p>
<p>Better opinion, better confirmation,</p>
<p>For all the soil of the achievement goes</p>
<p>With me into the earth. It seemed in me</p>
<p>But as an honor snatched with boist’rous hand,</p>
<p>And I had many living to upbraid</p>
<p>My gain of it by their assistances,</p>
<p>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</p>
<p>Wounding supposèd peace. All these bold fears</p>
<p>Thou see’st with peril I have answerèd,</p>
<p>For all my reign hath been but as a scene</p>
<p>Acting that argument. And now my death</p>
<p>Changes the mood, for what in me was purchased</p>
<p>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort.</p>
<p>So thou the garland wear’st successively.</p>
<p>Yet though thou stand’st more sure than I could do,</p>
<p>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green,</p>
<p>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</p>
<p>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta’en out,</p>
<p>By whose fell working I was first advanced</p>
<p>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</p>
<p>To be again displaced; which to avoid,</p>
<p>I cut them off and had a purpose now</p>
<p>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</p>
<p>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</p>
<p>Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</p>
<p>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</p>
<p>With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,</p>
<p>May waste the memory of the former days.</p>
<p>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</p>
<p>That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</p>

<b>KING</b>
<p>Oh my son, God made you take it from me so that, in pleading your case so beautifully, you would make me love you more! Come here, Harry. Sit by my bed and listen to what I think will be the last advice I ever give. God knows the unusual paths and indirect, crooked ways that led me to this crown. And I know very well how much anxiety it has caused as I’ve worn it. It will fall to you in bitter peace, with better support and stronger approval. The stain of its obtainment dies now, with me. On me, the crown seemed like an honor grabbed with a violent hand, and many people lived to remind me that they had helped me take it. Eventually, those daily reminders grew into war and bloodshed, doing damage to the peace. You can see how much pain it’s caused me as I’ve fought my foes. My entire reign has been like a play, in which we rehash that disagreement. Now my death changes the show. What I bought, you will inherit. You’ll wear the crown by right of succession. But even though you have a firmer claim to the crown than I had, it’s not firm enough. Anger is still fresh, and my former friends—whom you must make into your friends—have only recently been disarmed. It was their power that first got me the crown, and I feared that same power could take me down. To avoid that, I defeated their rebellion, and planned to lead an army to the Holy Land. I thought that, with nothing to occupy themselves, they’d start eyeing me and my crown. Therefore, my Harry, make it your policy to focus the distracted minds of the people with foreign wars. Military actions abroad will make people forget about troubling matters in the past. I’d say more, but my lungs are so worn out that I don’t have the strength to speak. God forgive me for how I came by the crown, and may he grant that you enjoy it in peace.</p>
