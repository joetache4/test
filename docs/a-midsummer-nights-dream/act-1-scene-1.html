<p>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</p>

<p>Our wedding day is almost here, my beautiful Hippolyta. We’ll be getting married in four days, on the day of the new moon.

<p>Full of vexation come I with complaint</p>

<p>This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.—</p>
<p>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,</p>

<p>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats—messengers</p>

<b>EGEUS</b>
<p>I’m here, full of anger, to complain about my daughter Hermia.—Step forward, Demetrius.—My lord, this man, Demetrius, has my permission to marry her.—Step forward, Lysander.—But this other man, Lysander, has cast a magic spell over my child’s heart.—You, you, Lysander, you’ve given her poems, and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter. You’ve pretended to be in love with her, singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight, and you’ve captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair, rings, toys, trinkets, knickknacks, little presents, flowers, and candies—things that can really influence an impressionable young person. You’ve connived to steal my daughter’s heart, making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient (like she should be).—And, my gracious duke, if she won’t agree to marry Demetrius right now, I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens. Since she belongs to me, I can do what I want with her—as the law says: I can either make her marry Demetrius—or have her killed.</p>

<p>Either to die the death or to abjure</p>
<p>Forever the society of men.</p>
<p>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires.</p>
<p>Know of your youth. Examine well your blood—</p>

<p>You can endure the livery of a nun,</p>
<p>For aye to be in shady cloister mewed,</p>

</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>THESEUS</b>
<p>You’ll either be executed or you’ll never see another man again. So think carefully about what you want, beautiful Hermia. Consider how young you are, and question your feelings. Then decide whether you could stand to be a nun, wearing a priestess’ habit and caged up in a cloister forever, living your entire life without a husband or children, weakly chanting hymns to the cold and virginal goddess of the moon. People who can restrain their passions and stay virgins forever are holy. But although a virgin priestess might be rewarded in heaven, a married woman is happier on Earth. A married woman is like a rose who is picked and made into a beautiful perfume, while a priestess just withers away on the stem.</p>

<p>Did you just call me “beautiful”? Take it back. You’re the beautiful one as far as Demetrius is concerned. Oh, you’re so lucky! Your eyes are like stars, and your voice is more musical than a lark’s song is to a shepherd in the springtime. Sickness is contagious—I wish beauty were contagious too! I would catch your good looks before I left. My ear would be infected by your voice, my eye by your eye, and my tongue would come down with a bad case of your melodious speech. If the world were mine, I’d give it all up—everything except Demetrius—to be you. Oh, teach me how you look the way you do, and which tricks you used to make Demetrius fall in love with you.</p>

<p>How happy some o’er other some can be!</p>
<p>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</p>
<p>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.</p>
<p>He will not know what all but he do know.</p>
<p>And as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,</p>
<p>So I, admiring of his qualities.</p>
<p>Things base and vile, holding no quantity,</p>
<p>Love can transpose to form and dignity.</p>
<p>Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind.</p>
<p>And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.</p>
<p>Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste—</p>
<p>Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.</p>
<p>And therefore is Love said to be a child,</p>
<p>Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.</p>
<p>As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</p>
<p>So the boy Love is perjured everywhere.</p>
<p>For ere Demetrius looked on Hermia’s eyne,</p>
<p>He hailed down oaths that he was only mine.</p>
<p>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</p>
<p>So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.</p>
<p>I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.</p>
<p>Then to the wood will he tomorrow night</p>
<p>Pursue her. And for this intelligence</p>
<p>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.</p>
<p>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</p>
<p>To have his sight thither and back again.</p>

<b>HELENA</b>
<p>It’s amazing how much happier some people are than others! People throughout Athens think I’m as beautiful as Hermia. But so what? Demetrius doesn’t think so, and that’s all that matters. He refuses to admit what everyone else knows. But even though he’s making a mistake by obsessing over Hermia so much, I’m also making a mistake, since I obsess over him. Love can make worthless things beautiful. When we’re in love, we don’t see with our eyes but with our minds. That’s why paintings of Cupid, the god of love, always show him as blind. And love doesn’t have good judgment either—Cupid, has wings and no eyes, so he’s bound to be reckless and hasty. That’s why they say love is a child. because it makes such bad choices. Just as boys like to play games by telling lies, Cupid breaks his promises all the time. Before Demetrius ever saw Hermia, he showered me with promises and swore he’d be mine forever. But when he got all hot and bothered over Hermia, his promises melted away. I’ll go tell Demetrius that Hermia is running away tomorrow night. He’ll run after her. If he’s grateful to me for this information, it’ll be worth my pain in helping him pursue my rival Hermia. At least I’ll get to see him when he goes, and then again when he comes back.</p>
