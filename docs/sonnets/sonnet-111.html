<p>O for my sake do you with Fortune chide,</p>
<p>The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,</p>
<p>That did not better for my life provide</p>
<p>Than public means which public manners breeds.</p>
<p>Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,</p>
<p>And almost thence my nature is subdued</p>
<p>To what it works in, like the dyer’s hand:</p>
<p>Pity me then, and wish I were renewed,</p>
<p>Whilst like a willing patient I will drink</p>
<p>Potions of eisel ’gainst my strong infection;</p>
<p>No bitterness that I will bitter think,</p>
<p>Nor double penance, to correct correction.</p>
<p>Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,</p>
<p>Ev’n that your pity is enough to cure me.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<p>I know you curse my bad luck for having no better way to make a living than in front of the public, which has had a bad effect on my morals and behavior. This is why I have a bad name, and coming into contact with the public so much has polluted my very nature, just like a cloth-dyer’s hand becomes stained with his dye. So take pity on me and hope that I can go back to being the way I would have been if I hadn’t been contaminated by the public; meanwhile, I’ll drink bitter medicines made of vinegar to cure myself of this infection. I won’t think that the medicine’s bitter no matter how bitter it is, nor will I protest at having to do double penance to try to undo the bad influence. So pity me, dear friend, and I assure you: Your pity alone is enough to cure me.</p>
