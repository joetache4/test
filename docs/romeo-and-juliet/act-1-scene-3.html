<p>Even or odd, of all days in the year,</p>

<p>On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.</p>

<p>Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,</p>
<p>To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!</p>
<p>“Shake!” quoth the dovehouse. ’Twas no need, I trow,</p>
<p>To bid me trudge.</p>
<p>And since that time it is eleven years,</p>
<p>For then she could stand alone. Nay, by the rood,</p>
<p>She could have run and waddled all about,</p>
<p>For even the day before, she broke her brow.</p>
<p>And then my husband—God be with his soul!</p>
<p>He was a merry man—took up the child.</p>
<p>“Yea,” quoth he, “Dost thou fall upon thy face?</p>
<p>Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit,</p>
<p>Wilt thou not, Jule?” and, by my holy dame,</p>
<p>The pretty wretch left crying and said “ay.”</p>
<p>To see now, how a jest shall come about!</p>
<p>I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,</p>
<p>I never should forget it. “Wilt thou not, Jule?” quoth he.</p>

<p>Whether it’s even or odd, of all the days in the year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she’ll be fourteen. She and Susan—God rest her and all Christian souls—were born on the same day. Well, Susan died and is with God. She was too good for me. But like I said, on the night of Lammas Eve, she will be fourteen. Yes, she will. Indeed, I remember it well. It’s been eleven years since the earthquake. She stopped nursing from my breast on that very day. I’ll never forget it. I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun, under the wall of the dovehouse. You and your husband were in Mantua. Boy, do I have some memory! But like I said, when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple, the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast. Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake. There was no need to tell me to get out of there. That was eleven years ago. By then she could stand up all by herself. No, I swear, by that time she could run and waddle all around. I remember because she had cut her forehead just the day before. My husband—God rest his soul, he was a happy man—picked up the child. “Oh,” he said, “Did you fall on your face? You’ll fall backward when you grow smarter. Won’t you, Jule.” And I swear, the poor pretty thing stopped crying and said, “Yes.” Oh, to watch a joke come true! I bet if I live a thousand years, I’ll never forget it. “Won’t you, Jule,” he said. And the pretty fool stopped crying and said, “Yes.”</p>

You’ll fall backward when you grow up, won’t you, Jule?” And she stopped crying and said, “Yes.”</p>

<p><em>(to JULIET)</em> What do you say? Can you love this gentleman? Tonight you’ll see him at our feast. Study Paris’ face and find pleasure in his beauty. Examine every line of his features and see how they work together to make him handsome. If you are confused, just look into his eyes. This man is single, and he lacks only a bride to make him perfect and complete. As is right, fish live in the sea, and it’s wrong for a beauty like you to hide from a handsome man like him. Many people think he’s handsome, and whoever becomes his bride will be just as admired. You would share all that he possesses, and by having him, you would lose nothing.</p>
