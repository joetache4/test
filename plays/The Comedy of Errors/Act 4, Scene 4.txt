  - sp: DROMIO OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long ears.—I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me with beating. I am waked with it when I sleep, raised with it when I sit, driven out of doors with it when I go from home, welcomed home with it when I return. Nay, I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat, and I think when he hath lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door."
    m:
      - "I am an ass, indeed: you can tell by my long ears. I’ve served this man from the moment I was born until this very instant, and all I’ve ever gotten from him are bruises. When I’m cold, his beatings keep me warm. When I’m hot, they keep me cool. He wakes me up by beating me, makes me stand by beating me, sends me out of the house and welcomes me back by beating me. Seriously, I carry beatings around with me like a beggar woman carries her baby. I figure that once he’s crippled me, I’ll beg by showing off my beatings."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Come, go along. My wife is coming yonder."

    m:
      - "Mistress, think about your end—beware of your death! Or as the parrot says: “Beware of the rope’s end,” and watch out for a hanging."

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Wilt thou still talk? *(beats DROMIO OF EPHESUS)*"
    m:
      - "Are you going to keep talking? *(beats DROMIO OF EPHESUS)*"

  - sp: COURTESAN
    o:

    m:
      - "Now what do you think? Your husband’s mad, isn’t he?"

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "His incivility confirms no less.—"

      - "Establish him in his true sense again,"
      - "And I will please you what you will demand."
    m:

      - "There is my hand, and let it feel your ear. *(strikes PINCH)*"
    m:
      - "Here’s my hand. Let it feel your ear. *(he strikes PINCH)*"

  - sp: PINCH
    o:
      - "I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,"
      - "To yield possession to my holy prayers"
      - "And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight."
      - "I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven."
    m:
      - "Satan! You are living inside this man! I order you to release him through my prayers and to return immediately to the darkness you came from. I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven."

      - "You minion, you, are these your customers?"
      - "Did this companion with the saffron face"
      - "Revel and feast it at my house today"
      - "Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut"
      - "And I denied to enter in my house?"
    m:
      - "Listen, hussy—is this man one of your customers? Did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house?"

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "O husband, God doth know you dined at home,"
      - "Where would you had remained until this time,"
      - "Free from these slanders and this open shame."
    m:
      - "Oh, husband, God himself knows you ate at home. I wish you had stayed there, avoiding these scandals and this public embarrassment!"

  - sp: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "“Dined at home”? Thou villain, what sayest thou?"
    m:
      - "Ate at home? You there, rogue, what do you have to say about that?"

  - sp: DROMIO OF EPHESUS
    o:
      - "Certes, she did; the kitchen vestal scorned you."

  - sp: ADRIANA
    o:
      - "*(to PINCH)* Is’t good to soothe him in these contraries?"
    m:
      - "*(to PINCH)* Should I try to soothe him by pretending to agree with his lies?"

  - sp: PINCH
    o:
      - "It is no shame. The fellow finds his vein"
      - "And, yielding to him, humors well his frenzy."
    m:
