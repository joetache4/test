<p>The extreme dangers and the drops of blood</p>
<p>Shed for my thankless country are requited</p>
<p>But with that surname; a good memory,</p>
<p>And witness of the malice and displeasure</p>
<p>Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;</p>
<p>The cruelty and envy of the people,</p>
<p>Permitted by our dastard nobles, who</p>

<p>And suffer’d me by the voice of slaves to be</p>
<p>Whoop’d out of Rome. Now this extremity</p>

<p>Mistake me not—to save my life, for if</p>
<p>I had fear’d death, of all the men i’ the world</p>
<p>I would have ’voided thee, but in mere spite,</p>

<b>CORIOLANUS</b>
<p>My name is Caius Martius. I’ve done great hurt and mischief to you particularly and to all the Volsces, proof of which is my surname: Coriolanus. I worked very hard, faced extreme dangers, and shed drops of blood for my ungrateful country. My only compensation is that name. It’s a reminder and signifier of the hatred you should feel for me. That name is all that is left. With envious cruelty, the Roman people, enabled by the cowardly nobles, have turned on me and taken away all that I had. These slaves have voted me out of Rome.  These extreme circumstances are what have brought me to your home. Make no mistake: I have no wish to save my life. If I feared death, I would have avoided you more than any other man in the world. Instead I stand here before you with only my hatred and desire for revenge against my banishers. If you’re inclined to seek vengeance of your own and end the shame that’s seen throughout your country, see now how you can use my suffering to serve your purpose. Helping me get revenge will be beneficial to you. I’ll fight my own cursed country with the fury of all the hell beings. But if you choose not to do this, if you’re too tired to take this chance, then since I am also too tired to keep living, I present my throat to you and your longstanding hatred. You’d be a fool not to cut it.  I’ve always pursued you with hatred, I’ve spilled barrels of your country’s blood, so to let me live would only bring you shame unless I can work on your behalf.</p>

<p>O Martius, Martius!</p>
<p>Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart</p>
<p>A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter</p>
<p>Should from yond cloud speak divine things,</p>
<p>And say “’Tis true,” I’ld not believe them more</p>
<p>Than thee, all noble Martius. Let me twine</p>
<p>Mine arms about that body, where against</p>
<p>My grained ash an hundred times hath broke</p>
<p>And scarr’d the moon with splinters: here I clip</p>
<p>The anvil of my sword, and do contest</p>
<p>As hotly and as nobly with thy love</p>
<p>As ever in ambitious strength I did</p>
<p>Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,</p>
<p>I loved the maid I married; never man</p>
<p>Sigh’d truer breath; but that I see thee here,</p>
<p>Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart</p>
<p>Than when I first my wedded mistress saw</p>
<p>Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,</p>
<p>We have a power on foot; and I had purpose</p>
<p>Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,</p>
<p>Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out</p>
<p>Twelve several times, and I have nightly since</p>
<p>Dreamt of encounters ’twixt thyself and me;</p>
<p>We have been down together in my sleep,</p>
<p>Unbuckling helms, fisting each other’s throat,</p>
<p>And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Martius,</p>
<p>Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that</p>
<p>Thou art thence banish’d, we would muster all</p>
<p>From twelve to seventy, and pouring war</p>
<p>Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,</p>
<p>Like a bold flood o’er-bear. O, come, go in,</p>
<p>And take our friendly senators by the hands;</p>
<p>Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,</p>
<p>Who am prepared against your territories,</p>
<p>Though not for Rome itself.</p>
</td>

<b>AUFIDIUS</b>
<p>Oh, Martius, Martius! Each word that you’ve spoken has weeded from my heart a root of longstanding hatred. If from that far cloud Jupiter should speak divine things and say, “It’s true,” I would believe him no less than I believe you, noble Martius. Let me wrap my arms around this body of yours, which my wooden lance has beaten and been splintered against a hundred times. You are the anvil that my sword used to strike, and now I embrace you. Now I strive to gain your comradeship with as much ferocity and honor as I used to fight you. You should know: I loved the woman I married, that’s the truth, but seeing you here, you noble thing, makes my heart  more enraptured than when I first saw my new bride walk across my threshold. You are the god of war! I tell you, our army is ready to deploy, and now I have reason again to force your shield off of your strong arm, or lose my own arm instead. You’ve defeated me twelve different times, and every night since I have dreamed of encounters between us. We’d fight down on the ground, taking off our helmets, forcing our fists into each other’s throats. Then I wake up, half dead, and it was all a dream. Worthy Martius, even if we had no reason to attack Rome other than the fact that you’ve been banished, we would assemble every man from ages twelve to seventy and flood ungrateful Rome with our fury. Come inside now and shake hands with our senators. They are just now saying goodbye to me, as I was about to attack Roman territories, though not Rome itself.</p>

<p>The guests here can’t stop talking about him. It’s as if he were the son and heir to Mars. He’s sitting at the head of the table and none of the senators are asking him any questions—they’ve all taken their hats off to him. Our general himself treats him like a mistress, touching his hand like a sacred relic, listening with wide-eyed wonder to his every word. But the bottom line is that our general is now half the man he was yesterday. He’s given half his power away to Caius Martius and the whole table supports him. He says that he’ll go and catch the keeper of Rome’s gates by the ears, that he’ll mow down whoever stands in his way, leaving a trail behind him.</p>
