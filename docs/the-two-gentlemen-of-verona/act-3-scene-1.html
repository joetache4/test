<p>My gracious lord, that which I would discover</p>
<p>The law of friendship bids me to conceal;</p>
<p>But when I call to mind your gracious favors</p>
<p>Done to me, undeserving as I am,</p>
<p>My duty pricks me on to utter that</p>
<p>Which else no worldly good should draw from me.</p>
<p>Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,</p>
<p>This night intends to steal away your daughter.</p>
<p>Myself am one made privy to the plot.</p>
<p>I know you have determined to bestow her</p>
<p>On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;</p>
<p>And should she thus be stolen away from you,</p>
<p>It would be much vexation to your age.</p>
<p>Thus, for my duty’s sake, I rather chose</p>
<p>To cross my friend in his intended drift</p>
<p>Than, by concealing it, heap on your head</p>
<p>A pack of sorrows which would press you down,</p>
<p>Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>PROTEUS</b>
<p>My gracious lord, the rules of friendship require that I keep secret what I’m about to reveal to you. But when I think of all you’ve graciously done for me, undeserving as I am, my duty urges me to divulge what nothing else in the world could pull out of me. You should know, your highness, that Sir Valentine, my friend, intends to run away with your daughter tonight. I was informed of the plot. I know you’ve decided to marry her to Thurio, whom your lovely daughter hates. And should she be taken away from you this way, it would greatly upset you in your old age. So, for the sake of my duty, I chose to go against my friend and his intended scheme rather than hide it and burden your mind with a pack of sorrows that would weigh you down and send you to an early grave.</p>

<b>DUKE</b>
<p>Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,</p>
<p>Which to requite, command me while I live.</p>
<p>This love of theirs myself have often seen,</p>
<p>Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,</p>
<p>And oftentimes have purposed to forbid</p>
<p>Sir Valentine her company and my court.</p>
<p>But, fearing lest my jealous aim might err,</p>
<p>And so, unworthily, disgrace the man—</p>
<p>A rashness that I ever yet have shunned—</p>
<p>I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find</p>
<p>That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.</p>
<p>And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,</p>
<p>Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,</p>
<p>I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,</p>
<p>The key whereof myself have ever kept;</p>
<p>And thence she cannot be conveyed away.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>DUKE</b>
<p>Proteus, I thank you for your honest concern. In return, ask anything you want of me while I still live. I’ve often happened to see this love of theirs for myself, when they’ve thought me asleep, and frequently I’ve considered forbidding Sir Valentine from seeing her or attending my court. But I’ve been afraid my jealousy might be misplaced, and as a result I might needlessly disgrace him—I’ve always disdained foolish impulsiveness. So I treated him kindly, only to learn of this deceitful plot you’ve just revealed. And, so you know how much I fear this, I make her sleep in one of the upper towers of the castle every night, because I know how impressionable youth can be led astray. I always keep the key myself, so that she cannot be taken away.</p>

I once thought she would fulfill her duty and take care of me in my old age, but now I’ve resolved to find a new wife and marry my daughter off to whomever will take her.

<p>A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.</p>

<b>VALENTINE</b>
<p>A woman will sometimes scorn the very thing that pleases her most. Send her another gift. Never give up, because her initial disdain will make her eventual feelings of love even stronger. If she frowns, it’s not out of hatred for you but rather to make you love her even more. If she chides you, it’s not so that you’ll go away, because the fools will go crazy if they’re left alone. Don’t be offended, whatever she says. By “Get out of here,” she doesn’t really mean, “Go away!” Flatter and praise women, compliment them, talk about their graces. Even if they have the blackest skin, say they have the faces of angels. In my opinion, any man that has a tongue isn’t really a man unless he can use it to win a woman.</p>

I want to be as fortunate as my slaves. I curse myself, too, because I sent them to the place where I, their lord, should be.” What’s this here at the end? “Sylvia, this night I will free you.” So that’s it, and here’s the ladder you planned to use. Why, Phaethon—for you are Merops’ son —will you try to drive the sun god’s chariot and burn the world in your brash idiocy? Will you grasp at the stars because they shine on you, as you grasp at my daughter for favoring you? Go, vulgar intruder, arrogant slave! Flash your fawning smiles on someone in your own class, and know that my patience—which is more than you deserve—allows you to leave this place. Thank me for this more than you’ve thanked me for all the favors I’ve granted you, which were too many. But if you stay here in my kingdom any longer than it takes to hurry away, then by heaven my anger will be far greater than any love I’ve ever felt for my daughter or for you. Get out of here! I will not hear your futile excuses. If you love your life, then you’ll hurry on your way from here.</p>

What good is light if I can’t see Sylvia? What joy is joy if Sylvia isn’t nearby? Unless I can be happy to think she is near and live on the mere thought of her perfection. Unless I can be near Sylvia in the night, there is no music in the nightingale’s singing. Unless I can look on Sylvia in the day, the day doesn’t even exist. She is my essence, and I’ll cease to exist if I’m not cared for, shined upon, valued, and kept alive by her gentle power. I don’t run from death if I run from the duke’s deadly threats. If I stay here, I am just waiting for death, but if I flee this place, then I flee from life itself.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, and she’s responded to the sentence—which, if not revoked, will be enforced—by crying a sea of melting pearls, which some people call tears. She cried them out at the feet of her ill-mannered father, and did so upon her knees, wringing her hands, whose beautiful whiteness appropriately seemed to result from her sorrow. But neither begging on her knees, nor extending her pure hands, nor heaving sad sighs, deep groans, or crying tears that flow like silver streams would move her unsympathetic father to change his order that Valentine must die if captured. Besides, her begging to repeal the order of banishment against you bothered him so much that he ordered her locked away and threatened to keep her there permanently.</p>

<p>That can’t mean her tongue, since it’s already written down that she’s slow with words. And it isn’t about her purse, because I’ll keep that shut. Now she may be loose in another way, and that I can’t help. Well, keep going.</p>

<p>More hair than brains? Maybe that’s so. I’ll prove it. The top of a saltshaker hides the salt, so therefore it is more than the salt. The hair that covers the brains is more than the brains, because the larger thing hides the smaller thing. Okay, what’s next?</p>
