    o:
      - "Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand"
      - "That chambers will be safe."
    m:
      - "Kinsmen, I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms."

  - sp: MENTEITH
    o:
      - "    We doubt it nothing."
    m:
      - "We don’t doubt it."

  - sp: SIWARD
    o:
      - "What wood is this before us?"
    m:
      - "What’s the name of this forest behind us?"

  - sp: MENTEITH
    o:
      - "    The wood of Birnam."
    m:

  - sp: MALCOLM
    o:
      - "Let every soldier hew him down a bough"
      - "And bear ’t before him. Thereby shall we shadow"
      - "The numbers of our host and make discovery"
      - "Err in report of us."
    m:
      - "Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him. That way we can conceal how many of us there are, and Macbeth’s spies will give him inaccurate reports."

  - sp: SOLDIERS
    o:
      - "    It shall be done."
    m:
      - "We’ll do it."

  - sp: SIWARD
    o:
      - "We learn no other but the confident tyrant"
      - "Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure"
      - "Our setting down before ’t."
    m:
      - "We have no news except that the overconfident Macbeth is still in Dunsinane and will allow us to lay siege to the castle."

  - sp: MALCOLM
    o:
      - "    ’Tis his main hope:"
      - "For, where there is advantage to be given,"
      - "Both more and less have given him the revolt,"
      - "And none serve with him but constrainèd things"
      - "Whose hearts are absent too."
    m:
      - "He wants us to lay siege. Wherever his soldiers have an opportunity to leave him, they do, whatever rank they are. No one fights with him except men who are forced to, and their hearts aren’t in it."

    o:
      - "    Let our just censures"
      - "Attend the true event, and put we on"

      - "Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,"
      - "But certain issue strokes must arbitrate."
      - "Towards which, advance the war."
    m:
      - "Soon we’ll find out what’s really ours and what isn’t. It’s easy for us to get our hopes up just sitting around thinking about it, but the only way this is really going to be settled is by violence. So let’s move our armies forward."

  - os: "Exeunt, marching"
    ms: "They exit, marching."
