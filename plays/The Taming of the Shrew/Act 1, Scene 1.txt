    ms: "The sound of trumpet fanfare. LUCENTIO and his servant TRANIO enter."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "Tranio, since for the great desire I had"
      - "To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,"
      - "I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,"
      - "The pleasant garden of great Italy,"
      - "And by my father’s love and leave am armed"
      - "With his goodwill and thy good company."
      - "My trusty servant, well approved in all,"
      - "Here let us breathe and haply institute"
      - "A course of learning and ingenious studies."
      - "Pisa, renownèd for grave citizens,"
      - "Gave me my being and my father first,"
      - "A merchant of great traffic through the world,"
      - "Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii."
      - "Vincentio’s son, brought up in Florence,"
      - "It shall become to serve all hopes conceived"
      - "To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds."
      - "And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study"
      - "Virtue, and that part of philosophy"
      - "Will I apply that treats of happiness"
      - "By virtue specially to be achieved."
      - "Tell me thy mind, for I have Pisa left"
      - "And am to Padua come, as he that leaves"
      - "A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep"
      - "And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst."
    m:
      - "Well, Tranio, here we are in fertile Lombardy, garden of Italy, about to fulfill my lifelong dream. You know how I’ve always longed to see the fair city of Padua, famous for its arts and letters, and now, thanks to my father’s generosity, here I am—with his blessing and your good company. So, my trusty servant—and you’ve never let me down—why don’t we settle here for a time to institute a course of study, a really rigorous curriculum. I was born in Pisa, famous for its serious citizens, like my father before me; my father, Vincentio, a successful, world-traveled merchant, was one of the Bentivolii. It’s only fitting that I, his son, reared in Florence, should concentrate on adding more virtuous deeds to my father’s own, stacking them on top of his wealth. For this reason, Tranio, I’ll study ethics and—for the time being, anyway—pursue those areas of philosophy that teach a man how to achieve happiness through virtue. What do you think of all this? Leaving Pisa for Padua, I feel a little like a thirsty man who turns from a puddle to a vast lake he can drink from."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*Mi perdonato,* gentle master mine."
      - "I am in all affected as yourself,"
      - "Glad that you thus continue your resolve"
      - "To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy."
      - "Only, good master, while we do admire"
      - "This virtue and this moral discipline,"
      - "Let’s be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray,"
      - "Or so devote to Aristotle’s checks"
      - "As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured."
      - "Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,"
      - "And practice rhetoric in your common talk;"
      - "Music and poesy use to quicken you;"
      - "The mathematics and the metaphysics—"
      - "Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you."
      - "No profit grows where is no pleasure ta’en."
      - "In brief, sir, study what you most affect."
    m:
      - "Pardon me, gentle master. As usual, I’m in complete agreement with you about everything, and glad that you still relish the idea of studying philosophy—and let me add that I admire your virtue and your moral discipline. That said, let’s not become total stoics or unfeeling blocks of wood and give up all thought of pleasure. We don’t want to become so focused on Aristotle that we forget to read Ovid. Here’s my thought: practice your logic as you chat with your friends, and your rhetoric in ordinary conversation. Use music and poetry to excite your senses. Math and metaphysics—well, I’d play them by ear, spending only as much time on them as you can stand. There’s nothing to be gained from things we take no pleasure in. What I’m saying, sir, is this: study what you most enjoy."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise."
      - "If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,"
      - "We could at once put us in readiness"
      - "And take a lodging fit to entertain"
      - "Such friends as time in Padua shall beget."
      - "But stay awhile. What company is this?"
    m:
      - "Thanks, Tranio. That’s good advice. Now if only Biondello would get here, we could find a nice place to stay where the friends we’ll make here in Padua could visit us. Wait! Who are all these people?"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "Master, some show to welcome us to town."
    m:
      - "Maybe it’s a parade to welcome us to town, master."

  - os: "LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by"
    ms: "LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand off to one side"

  - os: "Enter BAPTISTA, KATHERINE, BIANCA, GREMIO, and HORTENSIO"
    ms: "BAPTISTA enters with his elder daughter, KATHERINE, the younger daughter, BIANCA, and two suitors to BIANCA, an old man named GREMIO and a younger man named HORTENSIO."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "Gentlemen, importune me no farther,"
      - "For how I firmly am resolved you know—"
      - "That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter"
      - "Before I have a husband for the elder."
      - "If either of you both love Katherina,"
      - "Because I know you well and love you well"
      - "Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure."
    m:
      - "Enough, gentlemen! You can’t influence me on this point. You know how I feel. I’m determined not to permit my younger daughter to marry until I have a husband for the elder one. I’ve long regarded you both as good friends. Therefore, if either of you is partial to Katherina, he shall have my permission to court her freely."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "To cart her, rather. She’s too rough for me.—"
      - "There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?"
    m:
      - "Cart her, you mean. She’s too much for me. How about you, Hortensio? Are you still interested in marrying?"

  - sp: KATHERINE
    o:
      - "*(to BAPTISTA)* I pray you, sir, is it your will"
      - "To make a stale of me amongst these mates?"
    m:
      - "*(to BAPTISTA)* May I ask, sir, if it’s your intention to publicly humiliate me, showing me off like a whore in front of these suitors?"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "“Mates,” maid? how mean you that? No mates for you"
      - "Unless you were of gentler, milder mold."
    m:
      - "We’re not your suitors, that’s for sure! Not until you improve your temper, girl!"

  - sp: KATHERINE
    o:
      - "I’ faith, sir, you shall never need to fear."
      - "I wis it is not halfway to her heart."
      - "But if it were, doubt not her care should be"
      - "To comb your noddle with a three-legged stool"
      - "And paint your face and use you like a fool."
    m:
      - "Don’t worry, I couldn’t care less. The only possible interest I could take in you would be to hit you on the head with a stool, paint your face with blood, and make a fool out of you."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "From all such devils, good Lord, deliver us!"
    m:
      - "May the good Lord keep me safe from all women like her!"

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "And me too, good Lord!"
    m:
      - "Me too, Lord!"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(aside to LUCENTIO)*"
      - "Husht, master, here’s some good pastime toward."
      - "That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward."
    m:
      - "*(speaking so that only LUCENTIO can hear)* Wow! This’ll be fun to watch! This girl is either completely crazy or incredibly willful."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "*(aside to TRANIO)* But in the other’s silence do I see"
      - "Maid’s mild behavior and sobriety."
      - "Peace, Tranio."
    m:
      - "*(speaking so that only TRANIO can hear)* But her sister seems quiet and well behaved, as a young girl should be. Shhh, Tranio."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(aside to LUCENTIO)* Well said, master. Mum, and gaze your fill."
    m:
      - "*(speaking so that only LUCENTIO can hear)* Indeed, master. Let’s keep quiet and watch."

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "*(to GREMIO and HORTENSIO)*"
      - "Gentlemen, that I may soon make good"
      - "What I have said—Bianca, get you in,"
      - "And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,"
      - "For I will love thee ne’er the less, my girl."
    m:
      - "*(to GREMIO and HORTENSIO)* Gentlemen, since I’d like to make good on what I’ve said—Bianca, go inside. And don’t be unhappy, my dear. Whatever happens, you know I’ll never love you less."

  - sp: KATHERINE
    o:
      - "A pretty peat! It is best"
      - "Put finger in the eye, an she knew why."
    m:
      - "What a spoiled little brat. She’d make herself cry now, if she could think of a reason."

  - sp: BIANCA
    o:
      - "Sister, content you in my discontent.—"
      - "Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe."
      - "My books and instruments shall be my company,"
      - "On them to look and practice by myself."
    m:
      - "Sister, be happy in my unhappiness.—Sir, I will humbly obey you. I’ll take comfort in my books and music, reading and practicing my instruments."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "Hark, Tranio! Thou may’st hear Minerva speak."
    m:
      - "Listen Tranio! That’s Minerva’s voice you hear."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?"
      - "Sorry am I that our goodwill effects"
      - "Bianca’s grief."
    m:
      - "Signior Baptista, will you really be this cruel? I regret that our goodwill should cause Bianca unhappiness."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "Why will you mew her up,"
      - "Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell"
      - "And make her bear the penance of her tongue?"
    m:
      - "Why are you locking her away because of this fiend from hell, Signor Baptista? Why does the one daughter have to be punished for the other’s mouth?"

  - sp: BAPTISTA
    o:
      - "Gentlemen, content ye. I am resolved.—"
      - "Go in, Bianca."
    m:
      - "Gentlemen, I’ve made my decision. That’s all there is to it. Go inside, Bianca."

  - os: "Exit BIANCA"
    ms: "BIANCA exits."

  - o:
      - "And for I know she taketh most delight"
      - "In music, instruments, and poetry,"
      - "Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,"
      - "Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,"
      - "Or, Signior Gremio, you know any such,"
      - "Prefer them hither, for to cunning men"
      - "I will be very kind, and liberal"
      - "To mine own children in good bringing up."
      - "And so farewell.—Katherina, you may stay,"
      - "For I have more to commune with Bianca."
    m:
      - "And because I know how fond she is of music, playing her instruments, and poetry, I plan to hire live-in tutors for her. If either of you gentlemen knows anyone who would be suitable for the job, send him to me. I’ll pay well for good teachers. I don’t stint when it comes to educating my children. Goodbye, gentlemen. Katherina, you may stay. I have things to discuss with Bianca."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."

  - sp: KATHERINE
    o:
      - "Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What, shall I be appointed hours as though, belike, I knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?"
    m:
      - "Stay out here? I don’t think so! Am I to be dictated to, like a child? Told when to come and where to go? No."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "She exits."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "You may go to the devil’s dam! Your gifts are so good here’s none will hold you.—Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together and fast it fairly out. Our cake’s dough on both sides. Farewell. Yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father."
    m:
      - "You can go straight to hell! What you have to offer is nothing anyone wants. Hortensio, our desire to be married isn’t so great that we can’t wait this out patiently. It’s tough on both of us, but I guess we’ll live. So long. But to prove my love for Bianca, I’m going to see if I can find a good tutor to give her lessons in the things she enjoys. If I do, I’ll send him to her father."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "So will I, Signior Gremio. But a word, I pray. Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle, know now upon advice, it toucheth us both, that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca’s love, to labor and effect one thing specially."
    m:
      - "I’ll do the same. But wait—don’t go just yet, Signior Gremio. I know we’ve never exactly been allies, but it might be in both our interests, if you think about it, to put our heads together about one particular thing. That is, if we ever want to return to being rivals for Bianca’s love."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "What’s that, I pray?"
    m:
      - "And that would be—?"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister."
    m:
      - "To find a husband for her sister."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "A husband? A devil!"
    m:
      - "A husband? You mean a devil!"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "I say a husband."
    m:
      - "I mean a husband."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "I say a devil. Think’st thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?"
    m:
      - "I say a devil. Do you really think there’s a man fool enough to marry into hell—however rich the father is?"

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Tush, Gremio. Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough."
    m:
      - "Oh, I don’t know. Just because we wouldn’t want to put up with her tantrums, that doesn’t mean there aren’t guys who would, if we could find them. Guys who’d take her with all her faults, provided there were enough money involved."

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "I cannot tell. But I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to be whipped at the high cross every morning."
    m:
      - "I don’t know. All I know is *I’d* rather endure a public whipping every morning than put up with her—even with a big dowry."

  - sp: HORTENSIO
    o:
      - "Faith, as you say, there’s small choice in rotten apples. But come, since this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth friendly maintained till by helping Baptista’s eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to ’t afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?"
    m:
      - "The two choices are about equal, it’s true. But come, since we must be friends in the face of this new obstacle, let’s work together to find a husband for Baptista’s elder daughter, and thus free his younger daughter to have a husband, too. Then we can go back to fighting with each other. Happy the man that claims you, sweet Bianca! And may the best man win. What do you say, Signior Gremio?"

  - sp: GREMIO
    o:
      - "I am agreed, and would I had given him the best horse inv Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid the house of her! Come on."
    m:
      - "Agreed. This imaginary suitor for Katherina—I’d buy him the best horse in Padua if he’d get here quickly, woo her, marry her, take her to bed, and rid the house of her. Let’s go."

  - os: "Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO"
    ms: "GREMIO and HORTENSIO exit."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible"
      - "That love should of a sudden take such hold?"
    m:
      - "Sir, is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly?"

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "O Tranio, till I found it to be true,"
      - "I never thought it possible or likely."
      - "But see, while idly I stood looking on,"
      - "I found the effect of love in idleness"
      - "And now in plainness do confess to thee"
      - "That art to me as secret and as dear"
      - "As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was,"
      - "Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,"
      - "If I achieve not this young modest girl."
      - "Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst."
      - "Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt."
    m:
      - "Oh, Tranio, until it happened to me, I never would have thought it possible. But now I confess it openly to you, Tranio. You are to me what Anna, Dido’s sister, was to the Queen of Carthage. I confide in you. I tell you, Tranio, I’m on fire, in agony. I’ll die if I can’t have this modest young girl for my wife. Advise me, Tranio—I know you can. Help me, Tranio—I know you will."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "Master, it is no time to chide you now."
      - "Affection is not rated from the heart."
      - "If love have touched you, naught remains but so:"
      - "*Redime te captum quam queas minimo.*"
    m:
      - "Master, this is no moment to lecture you. The heart won’t be reasoned with. If love has touched you, love has touched you—end of story. But, as the Roman Terence advises, now that you’re a captive, it’s time to buy back your freedom at the lowest possible cost."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "Gramercies, lad, go forward. This contents."
      - "The rest will comfort, for thy counsel’s sound."
    m:
      - "Yes, you’re right. Please go on. I feel better already, and I know there’s more good advice where that came from."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "Master, you looked so longly on the maid,"
      - "Perhaps you marked not what’s the pith of all."
    m:
      - "Master, you were so focused on the girl herself, I wonder if you missed the main point here."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "Oh yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face"
      - "Such as the daughter of Agenor had,"
      - "That made great Jove to humble him to her hand"
      - "When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand."
    m:
      - "Oh no! I saw sweetness and beauty in her face of the kind that humbled great Jove. He saw it in Europa that time she brought him to his knees in Crete."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "Saw you no more? Marked you not how her sister"
      - "Began to scold and raise up such a storm"
      - "That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?"
    m:
      - "That’s all you noticed? You missed the part where her sister began to scold her and made such a ruckus that human ears could hardly stand it?"

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move"
      - "And with her breath she did perfume the air."
      - "Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her."
    m:
      - "Tranio, I saw her coral-pink lips move and perfume the air with her breath. I saw nothing in her except what is virtuous and lovely."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "*(aside)* Nay, then, ’tis time to stir him from his trance.—"
      - "I pray, awake, sir! If you love the maid,"
      - "Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:"
      - "Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd"
      - "That till the father rid his hands of her,"
      - "Master, your love must live a maid at home,"
      - "And therefore has he closely mewed her up,"
      - "Because she will not be annoyed with suitors."
    m:
      - "*(to the audience)* I think it’s time to rouse him from his trance.—Wake up, sir! If you love the girl, it’s time to figure out how to win her. The way things stand, her older sister is so bitchy and difficult that the father can’t wait to get rid of her. But until he does, your sweetheart is grounded, locked up at home and not allowed any suitors."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father’s he!"
      - "But art thou not advised, he took some care"
      - "To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?"
    m:
      - "Oh, Tranio, what a cruel father he is. Still, did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her?"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now ’tis plotted!"
    m:
      - "I did—and now I’ve got it!"

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "I have it, Tranio!"
    m:
      - "Tranio, I think I’ve got it!"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "  Master, for my hand,"
      - "Both our inventions meet and jump in one."
    m:
      - "I’ll bet we’re both thinking the same thing, master."

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "Tell me thine first."
    m:
      - "Tell me your idea first."

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "  You will be schoolmaster"
      - "And undertake the teaching of the maid:"
      - "That’s your device."
    m:
      - "You will pretend to be a schoolmaster and offer to teach the girl. Is that your plan?"

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "  It is. May it be done?"
    m:
      - "It is. Do you think it would work?"

  - sp: TRANIO
    o:
      - "Not possible. For who shall bear your part"
      - "And be in Padua here Vincentio’s son,"
      - "Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,"
      - "Visit his countrymen and banquet them?"
    m:
      - "No, not a chance. You’re supposed to be here in Padua studying. So who would fill in for you—pretend to be Vincentio’s son, live in his house, pore over his books, welcome his friends, and wine and dine his fellow expatriates from Pisa?"

  - sp: LUCENTIO
    o:
      - "*Basta,* content thee, for I have it full."
      - "We have not yet been seen in any house,"
      - "Nor can we be distinguished by our faces"
      - "For man or master. Then it follows thus:"
      - "Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,"
      - "Keep house and port and servants as I should."
      - "I will some other be, some Florentine,"
      - "Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa."
      - "’Tis hatched, and shall be so. Tranio, at once"
      - "Uncase thee. Take my colored hat and cloak."
    m:
      - "Enough! Don’t worry, I have it all figured out. No one has seen us yet, and no one knows what we look like—which of us is master and which servant. It’s obvious: *You* will be *me,* Tranio—live in my house, instruct the servants and do everything in my place just as I would. I, meanwhile, will impersonate some other made-up fellow—some guy from Florence or Naples, or some poor guy from Pisa. There! That’s a plan. Take off what you’re wearing and put on my hat and cloak."
