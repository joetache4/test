  - os: "Enter DUKE and THURIO"
    ms: "The DUKE and THURIO enter."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,"
      - "Now Valentine is banished from her sight."
    m:
      - "Sir Thurio, don’t worry. She is sure to love you now that Valentine has been banished from her sight."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "Since his exile she hath despised me most,"
      - "Forsworn my company and railed at me,"
      - "That I am desperate of obtaining her."
    m:
      - "Since his exile she has despised me even more, she has refused to be around me, and she has condemned me, so that I have no hope of winning her."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "This weak impress of love is as a figure"
      - "Trenchèd in ice, which with an hour’s heat"
      - "Dissolves to water and doth lose his form."
      - "A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,"
      - "And worthless Valentine shall be forgot."
    m:
      - "The weak impression love makes on the heart is like an ice sculpture, which melts into water and loses its form after being exposed to heat for just an hour. A little time will ease her disdain, and worthless Valentine will be forgotten."

  - os: "Enter PROTEUS"
    ms: "PROTEUS enters."

  - o:
      - "How now, Sir Proteus? Is your countryman,"
      - "According to our proclamation, gone?"
    m:
      - "How’s it going, Sir Proteus? Is your countryman gone, as our proclamation commands?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Gone, my good lord."
    m:
      - "He’s gone, my good lord."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "My daughter takes his going grievously."
    m:
      - "My daughter is upset over his departure."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "A little time, my lord, will kill that grief."
    m:
      - "A little time, my lord, will kill that grief."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "So I believe, but Thurio thinks not so."
      - "Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee—"
      - "For thou hast shown some sign of good desert—"
      - "Makes me the better to confer with thee."
    m:
      - "That’s what I believe, too, but Thurio doesn’t think so. Proteus, the high esteem I have for you—for you’ve shown me that you deserve it—makes me more inclined to discuss this matter with you."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Longer than I prove loyal to Your Grace"
      - "Let me not live to look upon Your Grace."
    m:
      - "Let me die if I ever live to see the day I am disloyal to Your Grace."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Thou know’st how willingly I would effect"
      - "The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter."
    m:
      - "You know how much I would like to arrange a marriage between Sir Thurio and my daughter."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "I do, my lord."
    m:
      - "I do, my lord."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "And also, I think, thou art not ignorant"
      - "How she opposes her against my will."
    m:
      - "And also, I think, you’re aware that she refuses to obey my will?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "She did, my lord, when Valentine was here."
    m:
      - "She refused when Valentine was here, my lord."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Ay, and perversely she persevers so."
      - "What might we do to make the girl forget"
      - "The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?"
    m:
      - "Yes, and oddly enough she continues to oppose me. What can we do to make this girl forget her love for Valentine and love Sir Thurio?"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "The best way is to slander Valentine"
      - "With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent,"
      - "Three things that women highly hold in hate."
    m:
      - "The best way is to slander Valentine and make up lies about his infidelity, cowardice, and poor parentage—three things women strongly hate."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Ay, but she’ll think that it is spoke in hate."
    m:
      - "Yes, but she’ll think these things are only said out of hatred for him."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Ay, if his enemy deliver it;"
      - "Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken"
      - "By one whom she esteemeth as his friend."
    m:
      - "Yes, if his enemy tells her these things. Therefore, someone she believes to be his friend must tell her the details."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Then you must undertake to slander him."
    m:
      - "Then you must make it your job to slander him."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do."
      - "’Tis an ill office for a gentleman,"
      - "Especially against his very friend."
    m:
      - "I would hate to do that, my lord. It’s a job unsuitable for a gentleman, especially against his own friend."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Where your good word cannot advantage him,"
      - "Your slander never can endamage him;"
      - "Therefore the office is indifferent,"
      - "Being entreated to it by your friend."
    m:
      - "If your praise can’t help him, then your slander can’t do him any harm. Therefore the task is neither good nor bad, since I, your friend, ask you to do it."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "You have prevailed, my lord. If I can do it"
      - "By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,"
      - "She shall not long continue love to him."
      - "But say this weed her love from Valentine,"
      - "It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio."
    m:
      - "You’ve convinced me, my lord. If I do what I can to speak against him, she won’t love him much longer. But even if she stops loving Valentine, it doesn’t mean she will love Sir Thurio."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,"
      - "Lest it should ravel and be good to none,"
      - "You must provide to bottom it on me;"
      - "Which must be done by praising me as much"
      - "As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine."
    m:
      - "So, as you break down her love for him, you must build it back up around me, so that it doesn’t come apart and become useless to everyone. You must do this by praising me as much as you dispraise Sir Valentine."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind"
      - "Because we know, on Valentine’s report,"
      - "You are already Love’s firm votary"
      - "And cannot soon revolt and change your mind."
      - "Upon this warrant shall you have access"
      - "Where you with Sylvia may confer at large;"
      - "For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,"
      - "And, for your friend’s sake, will be glad of you,"
      - "Where you may temper her by your persuasion"
      - "To hate young Valentine and love my friend."
    m:
      - "And, Proteus, we feel we can trust you with this task because we know, from what Valentine told us, that you’re already in love and can’t quickly fall out of love. For this reason you will be allowed to speak to Sylvia as you like. She is sad, sullen, and melancholy, and she’ll be happy to see you because you’re close to Valentine. Then you can shape her by your persuasion to hate young Valentine and love my friend, Sir Thurio."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "As much as I can do, I will effect."
      - "But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;"
      - "You must lay lime to tangle her desires"
      - "By wailful sonnets, whose composèd rhymes"
      - "Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows."
    m:
      - "I will do as much as I can. But you, Sir Thurio, aren’t doing enough to win her. To entice her and capture her desires, you must write sonnets whose well-crafted rhymes should be filled with vows of devotion."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Ay, much is the force of heaven-bred poesy."
    m:
      - "Yes, poetry bred by heaven is very powerful."

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "Say that upon the altar of her beauty"
      - "You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart."
      - "Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears"
      - "Moist it again, and frame some feeling line"
      - "That may discover such integrity:"
      - "For Orpheus’ lute was strung with poets’ sinews,"
      - "Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,"
      - "Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans"
      - "Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands."
      - "After your dire-lamenting elegies,"
      - "Visit by night your lady’s chamber window"
      - "With some sweet consort. To their instruments"
      - "Tune a deploring dump; the night’s dead silence"
      - "Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance."
      - "This, or else nothing, will inherit her."
    m:
      - "Say that you sacrifice your tears, your sighs, and your heart on the altar of her beauty. Write until your ink dries up and then moisten it again with your tears, and craft some emotional line that reveals your sincerity—after all, Orpheus’ lute was made from the same stuff as poetry and could soften steel and stones, make tigers tame, and cause huge whales to leave the deep ocean and dance on the sand. After you give her your love poems, go to her bedroom window at night with a group of musicians. While they play, sing a sad melody, and the silent night will enhance such sweet heartsick yearning. If that doesn’t win her, nothing will."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "This discipline shows thou hast been in love."
    m:
      - "Your instructions show that you’ve been in love before."

  - sp: THURIO
    o:
      - "And thy advice this night I’ll put in practice."
      - "Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,"
      - "Let us into the city presently"
      - "To sort some gentlemen well skilled in music."
      - "I have a sonnet that will serve the turn"
      - "To give the onset to thy good advice."
    m:
      - "And I’ll act on your advice tonight. Therefore, good Proteus, my guide, let’s go into the city to find some gentlemen skilled at playing instruments. I have a sonnet that will work to set your plan into action."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "About it, gentlemen!"
    m:
      - "Let’s do it, gentlemen!"

  - sp: PROTEUS
    o:
      - "We’ll wait upon Your Grace till after supper,"
      - "And afterward determine our proceedings."
    m:
      - "We’ll visit Your Grace after supper and then determine our next move."

  - sp: DUKE
    o:
      - "Even now about it! I will pardon you."
    m:
      - "Like I said, let’s do it! You’re excused."

  - os: "Exeunt"
    ms: "They exit."
