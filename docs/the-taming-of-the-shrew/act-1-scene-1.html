<b>LUCENTIO</b>
<p>Tranio, since for the great desire I had</p>
<p>To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,</p>
<p>I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,</p>
<p>The pleasant garden of great Italy,</p>
<p>And by my father’s love and leave am armed</p>
<p>With his goodwill and thy good company.</p>
<p>My trusty servant, well approved in all,</p>
<p>Here let us breathe and haply institute</p>
<p>A course of learning and ingenious studies.</p>
<p>Pisa, renownèd for grave citizens,</p>
<p>Gave me my being and my father first,</p>
<p>A merchant of great traffic through the world,</p>
<p>Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii.</p>
<p>Vincentio’s son, brought up in Florence,</p>
<p>It shall become to serve all hopes conceived</p>
<p>To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.</p>
<p>And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study</p>
<p>Virtue, and that part of philosophy</p>
<p>Will I apply that treats of happiness</p>
<p>By virtue specially to be achieved.</p>
<p>Tell me thy mind, for I have Pisa left</p>
<p>And am to Padua come, as he that leaves</p>
<p>A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep</p>
<p>And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>LUCENTIO</b>
<p>Well, Tranio, here we are in fertile Lombardy, garden of Italy, about to fulfill my lifelong dream. You know how I’ve always longed to see the fair city of Padua, famous for its arts and letters, and now, thanks to my father’s generosity, here I am—with his blessing and your good company. So, my trusty servant—and you’ve never let me down—why don’t we settle here for a time to institute a course of study, a really rigorous curriculum. I was born in Pisa, famous for its serious citizens, like my father before me; my father, Vincentio, a successful, world-traveled merchant, was one of the Bentivolii. It’s only fitting that I, his son, reared in Florence, should concentrate on adding more virtuous deeds to my father’s own, stacking them on top of his wealth. For this reason, Tranio, I’ll study ethics and—for the time being, anyway—pursue those areas of philosophy that teach a man how to achieve happiness through virtue. What do you think of all this? Leaving Pisa for Padua, I feel a little like a thirsty man who turns from a puddle to a vast lake he can drink from.</p>

<p>And practice rhetoric in your common talk;</p>
<p>Music and poesy use to quicken you;</p>
<p>The mathematics and the metaphysics—</p>
<p>Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.</p>
<p>No profit grows where is no pleasure ta’en.</p>
<p>In brief, sir, study what you most affect.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>TRANIO</b>
<p>Pardon me, gentle master. As usual, I’m in complete agreement with you about everything, and glad that you still relish the idea of studying philosophy—and let me add that I admire your virtue and your moral discipline. That said, let’s not become total stoics or unfeeling blocks of wood and give up all thought of pleasure. We don’t want to become so focused on Aristotle that we forget to read Ovid. Here’s my thought: practice your logic as you chat with your friends, and your rhetoric in ordinary conversation. Use music and poetry to excite your senses. Math and metaphysics—well, I’d play them by ear, spending only as much time on them as you can stand. There’s nothing to be gained from things we take no pleasure in. What I’m saying, sir, is this: study what you most enjoy.</p>

<p>I pray, awake, sir! If you love the maid,</p>
<p>Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:</p>
<p>Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd</p>
<p>That till the father rid his hands of her,</p>
<p>Master, your love must live a maid at home,</p>
<p>And therefore has he closely mewed her up,</p>
<p>Because she will not be annoyed with suitors.</p>

<b>TRANIO</b>
<p><em>(to the audience)</em> I think it’s time to rouse him from his trance.—Wake up, sir! If you love the girl, it’s time to figure out how to win her. The way things stand, her older sister is so bitchy and difficult that the father can’t wait to get rid of her. But until he does, your sweetheart is grounded, locked up at home and not allowed any suitors.</p>

<p>Enough! Don’t worry, I have it all figured out. No one has seen us yet, and no one knows what we look like—which of us is master and which servant. It’s obvious: <em>You</em> will be <em>me,</em> Tranio—live in my house, instruct the servants and do everything in my place just as I would. I, meanwhile, will impersonate some other made-up fellow—some guy from Florence or Naples, or some poor guy from Pisa. There! That’s a plan. Take off what you’re wearing and put on my hat and cloak.</p>
