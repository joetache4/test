<p>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.</p>

<p>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</p>

<p>Yes, believe me, if I had such risky business ventures in other countries, I’d be sad too. I’d worry about it every second.

Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad.</p>

<p>My wind cooling my broth</p>
<p>Would blow me to an ague when I thought</p>
<p>What harm a wind too great at sea might do.</p>
<p>I should not see the sandy hourglass run,</p>
<p>But I should think of shallows and of flats</p>
<p>And see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand,</p>
<p>Vailing her high top lower than her ribs</p>
<p>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</p>
<p>And see the holy edifice of stone</p>
<p>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</p>
<p>Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,</p>
<p>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</p>
<p>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</p>
<p>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</p>
<p>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</p>
<p>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</p>
<p>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?</p>
<p>But tell not me. I know Antonio</p>
<p>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>SALARINO</b>
<p>I’d get scared every time I blew on my soup to cool it, thinking of how a strong wind could wipe out my ships. Every time I glanced at the sand in an hourglass I’d imagine my ships wrecked on sandbars. I’d think of dangerous rocks every time I went to church and saw the stones it was made of. If my ship brushed up against rocks like that, its whole cargo of spices would be dumped into the sea. All of its silk shipments would be sent flying into the roaring waters. In one moment I’d go bankrupt. Who wouldn’t get sad thinking about things like that? It’s obvious. Antonio is sad because he’s so worried about his cargo.</p>

<p>No, that’s not it, trust me. Thankfully my financial situation is healthy. I don’t have all of my money invested in one ship, or one part of the world. If I don’t do well this year, I’ll still be okay. So it’s not my business that’s making me sad.</p>

<p>Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice</p>
<p>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio—</p>
<p>I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks—</p>
<p>There are a sort of men whose visages</p>
<p>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</p>
<p>And do a willful stillness entertain</p>
<p>With purpose to be dressed in an opinion</p>

<p>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.</p>

<p>Then I’ll play the happy fool and get laugh lines on my face. I’d rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun. Why should any living man sit still like a statue? Why should he sleep when he’s awake? Why should he get ulcers from being crabby all the time? I love you, and I’m telling you this because I care about you, Antonio—there are men who always look serious. Their faces never move or show any expression, like stagnant ponds covered with scum. They’re silent and stern, and they think they’re wise and deep, important and respectable. When they talk, they think everybody else should keep quiet, and that even dogs should stop barking. I know a lot of men like that, Antonio. The only reason they’re considered wise is because they don’t say anything. I’m sure if they ever opened their mouths, everyone would see what fools they are. I’ll talk to you more about this some other time. In the meantime, cheer up. Don’t go around looking so glum. That’s my opinion, but what do I know? I’m a fool.—Let’s go, Lorenzo.—Goodbye for now. I’ll finish my lecture after dinner.</p>

<p>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions. I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o’er a cold decree. Such a hare is madness the youth—to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word “choose!” I may neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I dislike—so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?</p>

<b>PORTIA</b>
<p>You think it’s that easy? If doing good deeds were as easy as knowing how to do them, then everyone would be better off. Small chapels would be big churches, and poor men’s cottages would be princes’ palaces. It takes a good priest to practice what he preaches. For me, it’s easier to lecture twenty people on how to be good than to be the one person out of twenty who actually does good things. The brain can tell the heart what to do, but what does it matter? Cold rules don’t matter when you’ve got a hot temper. Young people are like frisky young rabbits, and good advice is like a crippled old man trying to catch them. But thinking like this won’t help me choose a husband. Oh, the word “choose” is strange! I can’t choose who I like, or refuse who I dislike. I’m a living daughter still controlled by the wishes of her dead father. Isn’t it a pain that I can’t choose or refuse anyone, Nerissa?</p>

<p>Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations. Therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?</p>

<p>Your father was an extremely moral man, and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds. Your father’s idea was to have a game with three boxes. The suitor who can figure out whether to pick the gold, silver, or lead box will solve your father’s riddle—and that suitor’s the man for you. No one will ever choose the right box who doesn’t deserve your love. But tell me. Do you like any of the princely suitors who’ve come?</p>

<p>No, he didn’t charge interest—not in your sense of the word. But listen to what Jacob did. When he and Laban agreed that all the spotted lambs would be Jacob’s pay, it was the end of autumn, when the sheep were starting to mate. Because newborns look like whatever their mother sees during mating, he stuck some spotted branches into the ground right in front of the sheep, who saw them while they mated. The mothers later gave birth to spotted lambs, all of which went to Jacob. That was his way of expanding his business, and it worked. My point is that profit is a blessing, as long as you don’t steal to get it.</p>

<p>This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for—</p>
<p>A thing not in his power to bring to pass</p>
<p>But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven.</p>
<p>Was this inserted to make interest good?</p>

<p>That business venture you’re referring to happened because God made it happen like that. Jacob didn’t have any control over what happened. Are you saying this story proves that charging interest makes sense? That your interest payments are like Jacob’s sheep?</p>

<p>For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.</p>
<p>You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog,</p>
<p>And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine—</p>
<p>And all for use of that which is mine own.</p>
<p>Well then, it now appears you need my help.</p>

<p>You, that did void your rheum upon my beard</p>
<p>And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur</p>
<p>Over your threshold! Moneys is your suit.</p>
<p>What should I say to you? Should I not say,</p>
<p>“Hath a dog money? Is it possible</p>
<p>A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or</p>

<p>Signor Antonio, you’ve often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto. I have always just shrugged and put up with it because Jews are good at suffering. You called me a heathen, a dirty dog, and you spit on my Jewish clothes. And all because I use my own money to make a profit. And now it looks like you need my help. All right then. You come to me saying, “Shylock, we need money.” You say that!—even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you’d kick a stray mutt out your front door. And now you’re asking for money. What can I tell you? Shouldn’t I say, “Does a dog have money? Is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats?” Or should I bend down low, and in a humble and submissive voice say: “Sir, last Wednesday you spit on me. You insulted me on this day, and another time you called me a dog. And out of gratitude for these favors, I’ll be happy to lend you the money?”</p>

Anyway, my conscience says, “Stay put.” “Go,” the devil says. “Don’t go,” says my conscience. “Conscience,” I say, “you give good advice.” “Devil,” I say, “you give good advice.” If I listened to my conscience, I’d stay with the Jew my master, who’s a devil. But if I ran away from the Jew, I’d be following the advice of the devil, who’s the very devil himself.

<p>Some god direct my judgment! Let me see.</p>
<p>I will survey th’ inscriptions back again.</p>
<p>What says this leaden casket?</p>
<p>“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”</p>
<p>Must give—for what? For lead? Hazard for lead?</p>
<p>This casket threatens. Men that hazard all</p>
<p>Do it in hope of fair advantages.</p>
<p>A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross.</p>
<p>I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.</p>
<p>What says the silver with her virgin hue?</p>
<p>“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”</p>
<p>“As much as he deserves!”—pause there, Morocco,</p>
<p>And weigh thy value with an even hand.</p>
<p>If thou beest rated by thy estimation,</p>
<p>Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough</p>
<p>May not extend so far as to the lady,</p>
<p>And yet to be afeard of my deserving</p>
<p>Were but a weak disabling of myself.</p>
<p>As much as I deserve! Why, that’s the lady.</p>
<p>I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,</p>
<p>In graces, and in qualities of breeding.</p>
<p>But more than these, in love I do deserve.</p>
<p>What if I strayed no further, but chose here?</p>
<p>Let’s see once more this saying graved in gold,</p>
<p>“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”</p>
<p>Why, that’s the lady. All the world desires her.</p>
<p>From the four corners of the earth they come</p>
<p>To kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint.</p>
<p>The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds</p>
<p>Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now</p>
<p>For princes to come view fair Portia.</p>
<p>The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head</p>
<p>Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar</p>
<p>To stop the foreign spirits, but they come</p>
<p>As o’er a brook to see fair Portia.</p>
<p>One of these three contains her heavenly picture.</p>
<p>Is ’t like that lead contains her? ’Twere damnation</p>
<p>To think so base a thought. It were too gross</p>
<p>To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.</p>
<p>Or shall I think in silver she’s immured,</p>
<p>Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?</p>
<p>O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem</p>
<p>Was set in worse than gold. They have in England</p>
<p>A coin that bears the figure of an angel</p>
<p>Stamped in gold, but that’s insculped upon.</p>
<p>But here an angel in a golden bed</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>MOROCCO</b>
<p>I wish some god could help me choose! Let me see. I’ll look over the inscriptions again. What does the lead box say? “He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” Must give everything—for what? For lead? Risk everything for lead? This box is too threatening. Men who risk everything hope to make profits. A golden mind doesn’t bend down to choose something worthless. So I won’t give or risk anything for lead. What does the silver one say? “He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves.” As much as he deserves—wait a minute there, Morocco, and consider your own value with a level head. If your reputation is trustworthy, you deserve a lot—though maybe not enough to include this lady. But fearing I don’t deserve her is a way of underestimating myself. As much as I deserve—I deserve Portia! By birth I deserve her. In terms of wealth, talents, and upbringing, and especially love, I deserve her. What if I went no further and chose this one? But let’s see once more what the gold one says: “He who chooses me will get what many men want.” That’s Portia! The whole world wants her. They come from the four corners of the earth to kiss this shrine and see this living, breathing saint. Princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of Arabia to come see the beautiful Portia. The wide ocean doesn’t prevent them from coming to see her—they travel across it as if it were a little stream. One of these three boxes contains her lovely picture. Could the lead one contain it? No, it’d be a sin to think such a low thought. Lead’s too crass to hold her. Is she enclosed in silver, which is ten times less valuable than gold? Oh, what a sinful thought! Nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold. They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel, but that’s just engraved on the surface.</p>

<p>Okay, I’m ready. I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for! Gold, silver, and common lead. “He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” You’d have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you. What does the golden box say? Hmm, let me see: “He who chooses me will get what many men want.” What many men want—that “many” could mean that most people are fools and choose by whatever is flashy. They don’t go beyond what their eyes see. They don’t bother to find out what’s on the inside. Just like those birds called martins who build their nests on the outside of walls, people pay too much attention to what’s on the outside. So I won’t choose what many men desire, because I won’t jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population. So I guess it’s you, you silver treasure house. Tell me once more what you say. “He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” That’s nicely put—because who’s going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves? No one should have an honor he doesn’t deserve. Oh, wouldn’t it be great if property, rank, official positions, and other honors were earned only by merit, not by corruption? There wouldn’t be too many important men then. How many people who are humble now would be great then? How many people who give orders now would have to take orders? How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants? And how many common people would suddenly shine with nobility? Well, let me get back to my choice. “He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” I’ll assume I deserve the very best.—Give me a key for this one. I’ll unlock my fate here in a second.</p>

Doesn’t a Jew have hands, bodily organs, a human shape, five senses, feelings, and passions? Doesn’t a Jew eat the same food, get hurt with the same weapons, get sick with the same diseases, get healed by the same medicine, and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian? If you prick us with a pin, don’t we bleed? If you tickle us, don’t we laugh? If you poison us, don’t we die? And if you treat us badly, won’t we try to get revenge? If we’re like you in everything else, we’ll resemble you in that respect. If a Jew offends a Christian, what’s the Christian’s kind and gentle reaction? Revenge. If a Christian offends a Jew, what punishment will he come up with if he follows the Christian example? Of course, the same thing—revenge! I’ll treat you as badly as you Christians taught me to—and you’ll be lucky if I don’t outdo my teachers.</p>

Then if he loses, it’ll be his swan song, music before the end. And since swans need water to swim in, I’ll cry him a river when he loses. But on the other hand, he may win. What music should we play then? If he wins, the music should be like the majestic trumpets that blare when subjects bow to a newly crowned monarch. It’s the sweet sounds at daybreak that the dreaming bridegroom hears on his wedding morning, calling him to the church. Bassanio’s walking to the boxes now. He looks as dignified as Hercules did when he saved the princess Hesione from the sea monster. But he loves me more than Hercules loved the princess. I’ll play Hesione, and everyone else will be the bystanders watching with tear-streaked faces. We’ve all come out to see what will happen.—Go, Hercules! If you survive, I’ll live. I’m more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself.</p>

<p>So may the outward shows be least themselves.</p>
<p>The world is still deceived with ornament.</p>
<p>In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt</p>
<p>But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,</p>
<p>Obscures the show of evil? In religion,</p>
<p>What damnèd error, but some sober brow</p>
<p>Will bless it and approve it with a text,</p>
<p>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?</p>

<p>How many cowards whose hearts are all as false</p>
<p>As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins</p>
<p>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,</p>
<p>Who, inward searched, have livers white as milk,</p>
<p>And these assume but valor’s excrement</p>
<p>To render them redoubted. Look on beauty,</p>
<p>And you shall see ’tis purchased by the weight,</p>
<p>Which therein works a miracle in nature,</p>
<p>Making them lightest that wear most of it.</p>
<p>So are those crispèd snaky golden locks</p>
<p>Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind,</p>

<p>To be the dowry of a second head,</p>
<p>The skull that bred them in the sepulcher.</p>
<p>Thus ornament is but the guilèd shore</p>
<p>To a most dangerous sea, the beauteous scarf</p>
<p>Veiling an Indian beauty—in a word,</p>
<p>The seeming truth which cunning times put on</p>
<p>To entrap the wisest. Therefore then, thou gaudy gold,</p>
<p>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee.</p>
<p>Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge</p>
<p>’Tween man and man. But thou, thou meagre lead,</p>
<p>Which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught,</p>
<p>Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence,</p>
<p>And here choose I. Joy be the consequence!</p>
</td>

<b>BASSANIO</b>
<p>You can’t always judge a book by its cover. People are often tricked by false appearances. In court, someone can deliver a false plea but hide its wickedness with a pretty voice. In religion, don’t serious men defend sins with Scripture, covering up evil with a show of good. Every sin in the world manages to make itself look good somehow. How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars, the god of war? Take another example: beauty. It can be bought by the ounce in makeup, which works miracles. Women who wear it the most are respected the least. It’s the same thing with hair. Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful. But you can buy that kind of hair as a wig, and wigs are made from dead people’s hair. Decoration’s nothing but a danger, meant to trick and trap the viewer. A lovely, cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea, just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty. Nowadays, everyone’s fooled by appearances. So I’ll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box—it’s like the gold that Midas couldn’t eat. And I’ll have nothing to do with the pale silver either, the metal that common coins are made of. But this humble lead one, though it looks too threatening to promise me anything good, moves me more than I can say. So this is the one I choose. I hope I’m happy with my choice!</p>

The painter was like a spider in creating it so delicately. But her eyes—how could he keep looking at them long enough to paint them? I would’ve expected that when he finished one of them, it would have enraptured him and kept him from painting the other. But I’m giving only faint praise of the picture, just as the picture, as good as it is, is only a faint imitation of the real woman herself. Here’s the scroll that sums up my fate:</p>

<p>O sweet Portia,</p>
<p>Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words</p>
<p>That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,</p>
<p>When I did first impart my love to you,</p>
<p>I freely told you, all the wealth I had</p>
<p>Ran in my veins. I was a gentleman,</p>
<p>And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,</p>
<p>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</p>
<p>How much I was a braggart. When I told you</p>
<p>My state was nothing, I should then have told you</p>
<p>That I was worse than nothing, for indeed</p>
<p>I have engaged myself to a dear friend,</p>
<p>Engaged my friend to his mere enemy</p>
<p>To feed my means.</p>
<p>Here is a letter, lady,</p>
<p>The paper as the body of my friend,</p>
<p>And every word in it a gaping wound,</p>
<p>Issuing life blood.—But is it true, Salerio?</p>
<p>Have all his ventures failed? What, not one hit?</p>
<p>From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,</p>
<p>From Lisbon, Barbary, and India?</p>
<p>And not one vessel ’scape the dreadful touch</p>
<p>Of merchant-marring rocks?</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>BASSANIO</b>
<p>Oh Portia, these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper. My darling, when I gave my love to you, I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins—that I have noble blood, but no money. When I said that, I told you the truth. But my dear, when I said I was worth nothing, I was actually bragging—I should’ve said that I was worse than nothing. I’ve borrowed money from a dear friend who in turn borrowed money from his mortal enemy for my sake. Here’s a letter, my dear. The paper’s like my friend’s body, and every word in it is a bleeding wound on that body.—But is it true, Salerio? Have all his business ventures failed? Not even one success? He had ships to Tripolis, Mexico, England, Lisbon, North Africa, and India, and not one of these ships avoided the rocks?</p>

<p>The duke himself, and the magnificoes</p>

<p>Not one, my lord. Anyway, even if he had the money now, the Jew probably wouldn’t take it. I’ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man. He’s at the duke’s morning and night, accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice. Twenty merchants, the duke himself, and the highest-ranking Venetian nobles have all tried to persuade him to forget his contract, but nobody can do it. He’s determined to get the penalty specified in his contract with Antonio.</p>

Just as there’s no clear reason why one man doesn’t want a roast pig, or why another man can’t stand a harmless and useful cat, or another can’t tolerate bagpipes, so I can’t give a reason, and I won’t give a reason (other than the simple hate and loathing I feel for Antonio) why I’m pursuing this unprofitable case against him.

<p>The quality of mercy is not strained.</p>

<p>’Tis mightiest in the mightiest. It becomes</p>
<p>The thronèd monarch better than his crown.</p>
<p>His scepter shows the force of temporal power,</p>
<p>The attribute to awe and majesty</p>
<p>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings,</p>
<p>But mercy is above this sceptered sway.</p>
<p>It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings.</p>
<p>It is an attribute to God himself.</p>
<p>And earthly power doth then show likest God’s</p>
<p>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,</p>
<p>Though justice be thy plea, consider this—</p>
<p>That in the course of justice none of us</p>
<p>Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,</p>
<p>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render</p>
<p>The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much</p>
<p>To mitigate the justice of thy plea,</p>
<p>Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice</p>
<p>Must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant there.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>PORTIA</b>
<p>No one shows mercy because he has to. It just happens, the way gentle rain drops on the ground. Mercy is a double blessing. It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it. It’s strongest in the strongest people. It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him. The king’s scepter represents his earthly power, the symbol of majesty, the focus of royal authority. But mercy is higher than the scepter. It’s enthroned in the hearts of kings, a quality of God himself. Kingly power seems most like God’s power when the king mixes mercy with justice. So although justice is your plea, Jew, consider this. Justice won’t save our souls. We pray for mercy, and this same prayer teaches us to show mercy to others as well. I’ve told you this to make you give up this case. If you pursue it, this strict court of Venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there.</p>

<p>Wait a minute, Jew. The law has another hold on you. The laws of Venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen, the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner’s goods. The other half goes to the state. Whether the offending person lives or dies is up to the duke—there’s no one else to appeal to.

<p>The reason is your spirits are attentive.</p>
<p>For do but note a wild and wanton herd,</p>
<p>Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,</p>
<p>Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,</p>
<p>Which is the hot condition of their blood—</p>
<p>If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,</p>
<p>Or any air of music touch their ears,</p>
<p>You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,</p>
<p>Their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze</p>
<p>By the sweet power of music.</p>
<p>Therefore the poet</p>
<p>Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods</p>
<p>Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,</p>
<p>But music for the time doth change his nature.</p>
<p>The man that hath no music in himself,</p>
<p>Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,</p>
<p>Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.</p>
<p>The motions of his spirit are dull as night,</p>
<p>And his affections dark as Erebus.</p>
<p>Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>LORENZO</b>
<p>That’s because your soul is paying attention to the music. Take a wild herd of animals, or young untrained colts, leaping around like crazy, roaring and neighing loudly, which they have to do because it’s in their blood—but if they happen to hear a trumpet, or any kind of music, they all stand still. Sweet music makes their wild eyes peaceful. That’s why the poet Ovid wrote that the great musician Orpheus could make trees, stones, and rivers come to him by playing music. There’s nothing in the world that can resist music. The man who can’t be moved by the harmonious melodies is fit only for treason, violence, and pillage. His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld. Nobody like that should be trusted. Pay attention to the music.</p>

<p>How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring? You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died, and that it would be buried with you. If you didn’t want to take care of it for my sake, you should have just because you made so many vows that you’d take care of it. And now you claim you gave it to a judge’s clerk! No, I swear to God that clerk will never grow a beard on his face.</p>

<p>I have to be honest with you. You were wrong to give away your wife’s first gift so thoughtlessly, a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body. I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away. And here he is. I’d swear he wouldn’t leave it behind, or even take it off his finger, for all the money in the world. To tell the truth, Gratiano, you’re giving your wife a valid reason to get upset. If it were me, I’d be very upset too.</p>
