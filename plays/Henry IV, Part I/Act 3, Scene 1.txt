    ms: "HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, Lord MORTIMER, and Owen GLENDOWER enter."

  - sp: MORTIMER
    o:
      - "These promises are fair, the parties sure,"
      - "And our induction full of prosperous hope."
    m:
      - "These commitments are reliable, our allies are solid, and the beginning of our project bodes well."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower,"
      - "Will you sit down? And Uncle Worcester—"
      - "A plague upon it, I have forgot the map."
    m:
      - "Lord Mortimer, and kinsman Glendower, won’t you please sit? And Uncle Worcester—Dammit! I forgot the map!"

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "No, here it is. Sit, cousin Percy"
      - "Sit, good cousin Hotspur, for by that name"
      - "As oft as Lancaster doth speak of you"
      - "His cheek looks pale and with a rising sigh"
      - "He wisheth you in heaven."
    m:
      - "Here it is. Sit, kinsman Percy. Sit, good cousin Hotspur. For that is the name King Henry calls you, and whenever he says it, he grows pale, and with a sigh he wishes you were in heaven."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "  And you in hell,"
      - "As oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of."
    m:
      - "And you in hell, whenever he hears someone say “Owen Glendower.”"

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "I cannot blame him. At my nativity"
      - "The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,"
      - "Of burning cressets, and at my birth"
      - "The frame and huge foundation of the earth"
      - "Shaked like a coward."
    m:
      - "I don’t blame him. The sky was full of fiery meteors and comets when I was conceived, and when I was born, the entire earth shook like a coward."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "  Why, so it would have done"
      - "At the same season if your mother’s cat"
      - "Had but kittened, though yourself had never been born."
    m:
      - "Why, the same thing would have happened if your mother’s cat had given birth to kittens that day, whether you’d been born or not."

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "I say the earth did shake when I was born."
    m:
      - "I say there was an earthquake when I was born."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "And I say the earth was not of my mind,"
      - "If you suppose as fearing you it shook."
    m:
      - "And I say that if you think the earth shook because it was afraid of you, then the earth and I do not agree."

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "The heavens were all on fire; the earth did tremble."
    m:
      - "The heavens were all on fire, and the earth trembled."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,"
      - "And not in fear of your nativity."
      - "Diseas—d nature oftentimes breaks forth"
      - "In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth"
      - "Is with a kind of colic pinched and vexed"
      - "By the imprisoning of unruly wind"
      - "Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving,"
      - "Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down"
      - "Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth"
      - "Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,"
      - "In passion shook."
    m:
      - "Oh! Then the earth trembled when it saw the heavens on fire, and not in fear of your birth. When nature is diseased, strange eruptions can break forth. Often, the earth is pinched with a kind of colic, and troubled by gas in her belly. When that gas struggles to be released, it shakes old Mother Earth, bringing down steeples and moss-covered towers. When you were born, our Mother Earth was ill and shook with pain."

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "  Cousin, of many men"
      - "I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave"
      - "To tell you once again that at my birth"
      - "The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,"
      - "The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds"
      - "Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields."
      - "These signs have marked me extraordinary,"
      - "And all the courses of my life do show"
      - "I am not in the roll of common men."
      - "Where is he living, clipped in with the sea"
      - "That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,"
      - "Which calls me pupil or hath read to me?"
      - "And bring him out that is but woman’s son"
      - "Can trace me in the tedious ways of art"
      - "And hold me pace in deep experiments."
    m:
      - "Kinsman, I don’t take this kind of contrary behavior from many people. With your permission, I’ll say one more time that when I was born, the heavens were full of shooting stars. The goats ran down from the mountains, and herds of animals stampeded strangely through the fields. These signs marked me as an extraordinary person. All the events of my life prove that I should not be counted with ordinary men. Is there a man who lives anywhere within England, Scotland, or Wales who can say I learned from him, or that he taught me? And bring forward one human who can follow me in the complicated ways of magic, or keep up with me in my obscure experiments."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "I think there’s no man speaks better Welsh."
      - "I’ll to dinner."
    m:
      - "Well, nobody speaks better Welsh. I’m going to lunch."

  - sp: MORTIMER
    o:
      - "Peace, cousin Percy. You will make him mad."
    m:
      - "Stop now, kinsman Percy. You will upset him."

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "I can call spirits from the vasty deep."
    m:
      - "I can summon spirits from the deep ocean."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "Why, so can I, or so can any man,"
      - "But will they come when you do call for them?"
    m:
      - "Why, so can I, and so can any other man! But will they come when you summon them?"

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the devil."
    m:
      - "Why, kinsman, I can teach you to command the devil."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil"
      - "By telling truth. Tell truth and shame the devil."
      - "If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,"
      - "And I’ll be sworn I have power to shame him hence."
      - "O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!"
    m:
      - "And I can teach you, kinsman, how to shame the devil—by telling the truth! “Tell the truth and shame the devil,” as the old saying goes. If you do have the power to call him up, then bring him here. And I’ll swear I have the power to shame him into leaving. Oh, for goodness sake, tell the truth and shame the devil!"

  - sp: MORTIMER
    o:
      - "Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat."
    m:
      - "Enough already; stop this useless talking."

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head"
      - "Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye"
      - "And sandy-bottomed Severn have I sent him"
      - "Bootless home and weather-beaten back."
    m:
      - "Three times now, Henry Bolingbroke has raised an army against mine. And three times, I turned him back from the banks of the River Wye, and the sandy-bottomed River Severn. I sent him home, bootless and beaten by foul weather."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "Home without boots, and in foul weather too!"
      - "How ’scapes he agues, in the devil’s name?"
    m:
      - "You sent him home without his boots, and in foul weather? How in the devil’s name did he avoid catching fevers?"

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "Come, here’s the map. Shall we divide our right"
      - "According to our threefold order ta’en?"
    m:
      - "All right, here’s the map. Shall we divide up our territories according to our three-way agreement?"

  - sp: MORTIMER
    o:
      - "The Archdeacon hath divided it"
      - "Into three limits very equally:"
      - "England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,"
      - "By south and east is to my part assigned;"
      - "All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,"
      - "And all the fertile land within that bound"
      - "To Owen Glendower; and, dear coz, to you"
      - "The remnant northward, lying off from Trent."
      - "And our indentures tripartite are drawn,"
      - "Which being sealèd interchangeably—"
      - "A business that this night may execute—"
      - "Tomorrow, cousin Percy, you and I"
      - "And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth"
      - "To meet your father and the Scottish power,"
      - "As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury."
      - "My father Glendower is not ready yet,"
      - "Not shall we need his help these fourteen days."
      - "*(to GLENDOWER)* Within that space you may have drawn together"
      - "Your tenants, friends, and neighboring gentlemen."
    m:
      - "The Archdeacon has divided the land into three very equal parts. All of England southeast of the Trent and Severn rivers goes to me. All of Wales, and everything west of the Severn—including all the fertile land within those boundaries—goes to Owen Glendower. And, my dear kinsman, you get everything that remains to the north, coming up from the Trent. Our agreement is drawn up in triplicate. We can all sign it tonight, and then, kinsman Percy, tomorrow you, me, and Worcester will set off to meet your father and the Scottish army at Shrewsbury, as planned. My father-in-law Glendower isn’t ready yet, but we won’t need his army for another two weeks. *(to GLENDOWER)* By that time, you will have raised an army of the farmers on your land, your allies, and your neighbors."

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "A shorter time shall send me to you, lords,"
      - "And in my conduct shall your ladies come,"
      - "From whom you now must steal and take no leave,"
      - "For there will be a world of water shed"
      - "Upon the parting of your wives and you."
    m:
      - "I’ll be ready sooner than that, my lords; and I’ll bring your wives along with me. You should sneak away from them now, and leave without saying goodbye. Otherwise, they’ll cry an ocean of tears when you leave them."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,"
      - "In quantity equals not one of yours."
      - "See how this river comes me cranking in"
      - "And cuts me from the best of all my land"
      - "A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out."
      - "I’ll have the current in this place dammed up,"
      - "And here the smug and silver Trent shall run"
      - "In a new channel, fair and evenly."
      - "It shall not wind with such a deep indent,"
      - "To rob me of so rich a bottom here."
    m:
      - "I think my share, north of Burton here, isn’t as big as any of yours. Look how this river swoops in. It cuts out a huge chunk of my best land, in the shape of a half-moon. I’ll have a dam built. I’ll re-route the Trent River so it won’t go winding so far into my land and rob me of a fertile valley."

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "Not wind? It shall, it must. You see it doth."
    m:
      - "It won’t go winding? It will. It must. You see that it does."

  - sp: MORTIMER
    o:
      - "Yea, but Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up"
      - "With like advantage on the other side,"
      - "Gelding the opposèd continent as much"
      - "As on the other side it takes from you."
    m:
      - "Yes, but look how the Trent runs its course and winds a similar distance into my share. It cuts out the same amount of land from my side as it does from yours."

  - sp: WORCESTER
    o:
      - "Yea, but a little charge will trench him here"
      - "And on this north side win this cape of land,"
      - "And then he runs straight and even."
    m:
      - "Yes, but a small sum of money will pay to dig a trench, which will reclaim this bit of land on the north side. Then it will run straight along."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "I’ll have it so. A little charge will do it."
    m:
      - "I’ll do that. It will only take a little money."

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "I’ll not have it altered."
    m:
      - "I won’t have it changed."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "  Will not you?"
    m:
      - "You won’t?"

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "No, nor you shall not."
    m:
      - "No, and neither will you."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "  Who shall say me nay?"
    m:
      - "Who’s going to stop me?"

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "Why, that will I."
    m:
      - "Why, I will."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh."
    m:
      - "Well, say it in Welsh then, so I can’t understand you."

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "I can speak English, lord, as well as you,"
      - "For I was trained up in the English court,"
      - "Where being but young I framèd to the harp"
      - "Many an English ditty lovely well"
      - "And gave the tongue a helpful ornament—"
      - "A virtue that was never seen in you."
    m:
      - "My lord, I can speak English just as well as you. I was brought up in the English court. There, in my youth, I composed many English songs for the harp, lending the language lovely ornaments of music. That is an accomplishment you have never achieved."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "Marry,"
      - "And I am glad of it with all my heart:"
      - "I had rather be a kitten and cry “mew”"
      - "Than one of these same meter balladmongers."
      - "I had rather hear a brazen can’stick turned,"
      - "Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree,"
      - "And that would set my teeth nothing an edge,"
      - "Nothing so much as mincing poetry."
      - "’Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag."
    m:
      - "Indeed, and my whole heart is glad for that. I’d rather be a kitten and say “meow” than be a courtly balladeer. I’d rather hear a piece of brass turned on a lathe, or a ungreased wheel grind on its axle. Nothing sets my teeth on edge so as much as finicky poetry; it’s like the lurching steps of a lame horse."

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "Come, you shall have Trent turned."
    m:
      - "Fine. Change the Trent’s course."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "I do not care. I’ll give thrice so much land"
      - "To any well-deserving friend;"
      - "But in the way of bargain, mark you me,"
      - "I’ll cavil on the ninth part of a hair."
      - "Are the indentures drawn? Shall we be gone?"
    m:
      - "I don’t care. I’d gladly give away three times as much land to any friend who deserved it. But when it comes to negotiating a deal, mark my words: I’ll haggle over the smallest fraction of a hair. Are the agreements drawn up? Are we ready to leave?"

  - sp: GLENDOWER
    o:
      - "The moon shines fair. You may away by night."
      - "I’ll haste the writer, and withal"
      - "Break with your wives of your departure hence."
      - "I am afraid my daughter will run mad,"
      - "So much she doteth on her Mortimer."
    m:
      - "The moon is bright; you can leave during the night. I’ll tell the man writing up our documents to hurry, and I’ll tell your wives you’re leaving. I’m afraid my daughter will go mad because she loves Mortimer so much."

  - os: "Exit GLENDOWER"
    ms: "GLENDOWER exits."

  - sp: MORTIMER
    o:
      - "Fie, cousin Percy, how you cross my father!"
    m:
      - "Damn, kinsman Percy! How angry you make my father-in-law!"

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "I cannot choose. Sometime he angers me"
      - "With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant,"
      - "Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,"
      - "And of a dragon and a finless fish,"
      - "A clip-winged griffin and a moulten raven,"
      - "A couching lion and a ramping cat,"
      - "And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff"
      - "As puts me from my faith. I tell you what—"
      - "He held me last night at least nine hours"
      - "In reckoning up the several devils’ names"
      - "That were his lackeys. I cried “Hum,” and “Well, go to,”"
      - "But marked him not a word. O, he is as tedious"
      - "As a tired horse, a railing wife,"
      - "Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live"
      - "With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,"
      - "Than feed on cates and have him talk to me"
      - "In any summerhouse in Christendom."
    m:
      - "I can’t help it. He makes me angry with all his talk. Moles and ants, Merlin and his prophecies, dragons, a fish with no fins, a griffin without wings, a raven without feathers, a crouching lion and a cat rearing up to pounce. He talks so much mumbo-jumbo that I don’t know what to believe anymore. I’ll tell you this: he kept me awake last night for at least nine hours, listing the names of all the devils that serve him. I said, “Hmm,” and, “How interesting,” but he didn’t hear a word. Oh, he’s as tedious as a tired horse or a nagging wife; he’s worse than a smoke-filled house. I’d rather live in a windmill and eat nothing but cheese and garlic than in a luxurious home eating delicacies, if it meant I had to listen to him talk."

  - sp: MORTIMER
    o:
      - "In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,"
      - "Exceedingly well read and profited"
      - "In strange concealments, valiant as a lion,"
      - "And as wondrous affable, and as bountiful"
      - "As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?"
      - "He holds your temper in a high respect"
      - "And curbs himself even of his natural scope"
      - "When you come cross his humor. Faith, he does."
      - "I warrant you that man is not alive"
      - "Might so have tempted him as you have done"
      - "Without the taste of danger and reproof."
      - "But do not use it oft, let me entreat you."
    m:
      - "Truly, he’s a worthy man. He’s exceedingly well-read, and proficient in the occult; he’s as brave as a lion, incredibly charming, and as generous as the jewel mines of India. And do you know what, cousin? He holds you in great respect. He restrains his temper when you do something to put him in a bad mood. I promise you, there isn’t a man alive who could have challenged him as you have, and gotten away without being hurt or punished. But don’t try it too often, I beg you."

  - sp: WORCESTER
    o:
      - "*(to HOTSPUR)* In faith, my lord, you are too willful-blame,"
      - "And, since your coming hither, have done enough"
      - "To put him quite beside his patience."
      - "You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault."
      - "Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood—"
      - "And that’s the dearest grace it renders you—"
      - "Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,"
      - "Defect of manners, want of government,"
      - "Pride, haughtiness, opinion, and disdain,"
      - "The least of which, haunting a nobleman,"
      - "Loseth men’s hearts and leaves behind a stain"
      - "Upon the beauty of all parts besides,"
      - "Beguiling them of commendation."
    m:
      - "*(to HOTSPUR)* Truly, my lord, you are to blame in your stubbornness. Since you arrived, you have done enough to test his patience. You must learn, sir, to correct this fault. Sometimes it demonstrates greatness, courage, strength—and that honors you. But often it reveals fury, bad manners, lack of self-control, pride, arrogance, conceitedness, and contempt. In a gentlemen, the least of these qualities will make you lose people’s affections. It stains your beautiful qualities, making it impossible for them to be noticed."

  - sp: HOTSPUR
    o:
      - "Well, I am schooled. Good manners be your speed!"
      - "Here come our wives, and let us take our leave."
    m:
      - "Well, I have had my lesson. May good manners bring you success! Here come our wives; let’s say our goodbyes."

      - "In such a parley should I answer thee."
    m:

      - "With ravishing division, to her lute."
    m:
      - "I understand your kisses and you mine; that’s a conversation of emotion. I’ll study continuously, my love, until I learn your language. Your voice makes Welsh sound as sweet as the most eloquently written songs, sung by a fair queen in a garden of summer flowers, with a gorgeous accompaniment on her a lute."

You swear like a candymaker’s wife. “Not you, darn it.” And “I swear on my life,” and “God forgive me,” and “as plain as day.” Your curse words are smooth as silk. You’d think you’d never gone further than Finsbury in your life. Swear like the real lady you are, Kate. Let loose a good mouthful of curses; leave “darn” and such watered-down cursewords to those citizens, trimmed in velvet and wearing their Sunday best. Come on, sing."
