      - "This last old man, whom with a broken heart I’ve sent back to Rome, loved me better than a father. Indeed, he treated me like a god. Their last resort was to send him. Though I turned him away, out of love for him I again offered the same terms they had previously refused and now cannot accept. That is all I have yielded to he who thought that he could do more. I’ll no longer listen to any more pleas, made either by the state or by my private friends.  Ha! What shout is this?"

Let it be virtuous to be unmovable.What is that curtsy worth? Or those doe eyes, which can make the gods break their vows? I melt, and I’m no stronger than anyone else.  For my mother to bow to me is as if Mt. Olympus would plead before a molehill. And my young boy has an imploring look, which by nature I don’t want to deny. But let the Volsces destroy Rome and lay siege on Italy—I’ll never be so weak as to obey instinct. Instead I will stand firm, as if a man were his own creator and had no family."

Don’t ask me to dismiss my soldiers or to yield to the common people of Rome. Don’t tell me the ways in which I seem unnatural. Don’t try to mitigate my rage and need for vengeance with your colder reasons."

    m:
      - "Even if we were silent and didn’t speak, our clothing and the condition of our bodies would betray the lives we’ve led since your exile. Think how we three are worse off than all living women, because seeing you—a sight that should make our eyes flow with tears of joy and our hearts dance with relief—constrains our eyes from weeping and shakes our hearts with fear and sorrow to make the mother, wife, and child see the son, the husband, and the father tearing his country’s bowels out. Your hatred will kill us poor people. You deny our prayers to the gods, which is the only comfort we have, and if we can’t pray—and pray for our country—where will we go if you succeed, where will we go? Alas, either we must lose the country, our dear mother, or else we must lose you, our comfort in the country. We will inevitably face tragedy, but we do have a wish for one side to win. Either you must, as a traitor, be led with handcuffs thorough our streets, or else triumphantly march on your ruined country and wear the medal for having bravely shed your wife and children’s blood. For myself, son, I don’t intend to rely on fortune until these wars end. If I can’t persuade you to reach a noble compromise with both sides rather than seek total destruction, when you march to assault your country you’ll be treading—and believe me about this—on your mother’s womb, which brought you into this world."

    m:
      - "No, don’t leave us now. If it were the case that our request was to save the Romans and thereby destroy the Volsces, whom you serve, you might condemn us for poisoning your honor. But no, our appeal is for you to reconcile with them so that the Volsces may say, “We have shown mercy,” and the Romans may say, “We received mercy,” and both sides will salute you and cry, “May you be blessed for making this peace!” You know, great son, that the outcome of war is uncertain. But it’s certain that if you conquer Rome, the benefit you’ll reap in so doing is a name whose repetition will be plagued with curses. You’ll be remembered with these words: “The man was noble, but with his last attack he gave up his nobility, destroyed his country, and his name remains forever hated.” Speak to me, son. You’ve aspired to great honor, to behave like a god, to tear apart the sky with thunder and yet throw your lightning bolt so that it would only split an oak. Why don’t you speak? Do you think it’s honorable for a noble man to always remember how he has been wronged? Daughter, speak—he doesn’t like your weeping. Speak, boy—perhaps your childishness will move him more than our reasons can. There’s no man in the world more tied to his mother, and yet here he lets me prattle on like a common criminal. Never in your life have you done your dear mother any favors, while she, poor woman, who didn’t want to have another child, has cared for you while you were at war and safely home, heaped with honors. If you think my request is unfair, then turn me down. But if it’s not, then you’re a liar and the gods will punish you for failing to give me what you owe me as a son. He turns away. Down, ladies. Let’s shame him by getting on our knees. His surname, Coriolanus, has more pride than pity for our prayers. Down! This is the end. *(The women and young Martius kneel)* We’ll go home to Rome and die among our neighbors. Wait, look. This boy, who doesn’t know what’s going to happen to him but kneels and holds up his hands for fellowship, lends more strength to our petition than you have strength to deny. Come, let’s go. This fellow has a Volscian mother, his wife is in Corioles, and his child looks just like him by chance. Send us away. I’ll be silent until our city is on fire, and then I’ll speak a little."
