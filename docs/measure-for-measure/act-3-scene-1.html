<p>Be absolute for death; either death or life</p>
<p>Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:</p>
<p>If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</p>
<p>That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,</p>
<p>Servile to all the skyey influences,</p>
<p>That dost this habitation, where thou keep’st,</p>
<p>Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death’s fool;</p>
<p>For him thou labour’st by thy flight to shun</p>
<p>And yet runn’st toward him still. Thou art not noble;</p>
<p>For all the accommodations that thou bear’st</p>
<p>Are nursed by baseness. Thou’rt by no means valiant;</p>
<p>For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork</p>
<p>Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,</p>
<p>And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear’st</p>
<p>Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;</p>
<p>For thou exist’st on many a thousand grains</p>
<p>That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;</p>
<p>For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,</p>
<p>And what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain;</p>
<p>For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,</p>
<p>After the moon. If thou art rich, thou’rt poor;</p>
<p>For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,</p>
<p>Thou bear’s thy heavy riches but a journey,</p>
<p>And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;</p>
<p>For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,</p>
<p>The mere effusion of thy proper loins,</p>
<p>Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,</p>
<p>For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,</p>
<p>But, as it were, an after-dinner’s sleep,</p>
<p>Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth</p>
<p>Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms</p>
<p>Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,</p>
<p>Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,</p>
<p>To make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in this</p>
<p>That bears the name of life? Yet in this life</p>
<p>Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,</p>
<p>That makes these odds all even.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b>
<p>Be ready to die; then either death or life will be all the sweeter. Tell life this: if I lose you, I lose something that only fools would want to keep. You’re just a breath, subject to all the changes of weather that hourly buffet the body you occupy. You’re simply death’s dupe, constantly struggling to run away from him, while all the while you’re running toward him. You’re not noble, because all your civilized comforts come from lowly plants and animals. You’re by no means brave, because the forked tongue of a little snake scares you. Sleep is your best way to rest, and you do that a lot, yet you stupidly fear death, which is basically the same thing. You’re not a single being, because you’re composed of thousands of grains of dust. You’re not happy, because you’re always trying to get what you don’t have, and what you do have, you forget about. You’re unstable, your moods changing as often as the phases of the moon. If you’re rich, you’re actually poor—like an ass staggering under a load of gold bars, you’re just carrying your heavy wealth for a period, and you lose that wealth when you die. You don’t have any friends, for even your children—the offspring of your own loins—curse the gout, skin rashes, and colds for not carrying you off sooner. You’re neither old or young, but always suspended in a sort of mid-afternoon nap, because when young, you’re like an old beggar, wheedling money from your feeble elders. And when you’re old and rich yourself, you have neither the passion, love, agility, or beauty to enjoy your wealth. So, what in all this is worth living for? Life hides more than a thousand deaths. Yet it’s death, which fixes all these problems, that we fear.</p>

<p>Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you</p>
<p>and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to</p>
<p>corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her</p>
<p>virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition</p>
<p>of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,</p>
<p>hath made him that gracious denial which he is most</p>
<p>glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I</p>
<p>know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to</p>
<p>death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes</p>
<p>that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to</p>
<p>your knees and make ready.</p>

<b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b>
<p>Son, I overheard what happened between you and your sister. Angelo never meant to seduce her. He was only testing her virtue, to test his ability to judge character. Being a person of integrity, she virtuously refused him, and he was happy to hear it. I’m Angelo’s confessor, so I know this is true. Therefore, prepare yourself for death. Don’t prop yourself up with false hopes. Tomorrow you must die. Fall to your knees and prepare for confession.</p>

<p>He who made you lovely made you good, as well. Beauty has a cheap kind of goodness, which is why beauty doesn’t last.

<p>That’s not a bad idea. But, as the matter now stands, he’ll deny your accusation. He’ll say he was only testing you. So, listen to my advice.

I’m convinced there’s a way you righteously can do a poor wronged lady some well-deserved good, save your brother from the cruel law, keep your own gracious self pure, and greatly please the absent duke, if he ever returns to hear about all this.</p>

<p>This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance</p>
<p>of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that</p>

<p>like an impediment in the current, made it more</p>

<p>This maid still loves Angelo. Logically, his unfair cruelty should have ended her love, but it’s actually intensified it, the way water becomes violent and choppy when it hits a barrier. Go to Angelo. Pretend to yield to his request, and obey his demands to the letter. But set some conditions: that you not spend much time together, that it be in the dark, that there be absolute silence, and that it be in a convenient place. When he agrees—and now here’s the key part—we’ll tell the wronged girl to go in your place. If their encounter later comes to light, it might compel him to compensate her. The result of all this: your brother is saved, your honor is maintained, poor Mariana is helped, and the corrupt deputy is punished. I’ll prepare the girl and make her ready for the encounter. If you think you can manage this, the double benefit outweighs any blame for the deception. What do you think?</p>
