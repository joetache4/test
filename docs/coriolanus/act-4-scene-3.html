<p>The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing</p>
<p>would make it flame again: for the nobles receive</p>
<p>so to heart the banishment of that worthy</p>
<p>Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take</p>
<p>all power from the people and to pluck from them</p>
<p>their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can</p>
<p>tell you, and is almost mature for the violent</p>
<p>breaking out.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ROMAN</b>
<p>Most of it’s over, but one small thing would make it erupt again: if the nobles take the news of Coriolanus’ banishment so personally that they themselves decide to take all power from the people and do away with their tribunes forever. This could easily happen, and it would definitely lead to violence.</p>

<p>The day serves well for them now. I have heard it</p>

<p>Things are looking good for the Volsces now. As they say, the best time to seduce another man’s wife is when she’s in a fight with her husband. Your noble Tullus Aufidius will do well in this attack, since his main enemy, Coriolanus, is no longer fighting for his own country.</p>
