<b>ROMEO</b>
<p>If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,</p>
<p>My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.</p>
<p>My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne,</p>
<p>And all this day an unaccustomed spirit</p>
<p>Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.</p>
<p>I dreamt my lady came and found me dead—</p>
<p>Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think—</p>
<p>And breathed such life with kisses in my lips</p>
<p>That I revived and was an emperor.</p>
<p>Ah me! How sweet is love itself possessed</p>
<p>When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy!</p>

<b>ROMEO</b>
<p>If I can trust my dreams, then some joyful news is coming soon. Love rules my heart, and all day long a strange feeling has been making me cheerful. I had a dream that my lady came and found me dead. It’s a strange dream that lets a dead man think! She came and brought me back to life by kissing my lips. I rose from the dead and was an emperor. Oh my! How sweet it it would be to actually have the woman I love, when merely thinking about love makes me so happy.</p>

<p>Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.</p>
<p>Let’s see for means. O mischief, thou art swift</p>
<p>To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!</p>
<p>I do remember an apothecary—</p>
<p>And hereabouts he dwells—which late I noted</p>
<p>In tattered weeds, with overwhelming brows,</p>
<p>Culling of simples. Meager were his looks,</p>
<p>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones,</p>
<p>And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,</p>
<p>An alligator stuffed, and other skins</p>
<p>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves</p>
<p>A beggarly account of empty boxes,</p>
<p>Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,</p>
<p>Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,</p>
<p>Were thinly scattered to make up a show.</p>
<p>Noting this penury, to myself I said,</p>
<p>“An if a man did need a poison now”—</p>
<p>Whose sale is present death in Mantua—</p>
<p>“Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.”</p>
<p>Oh, this same thought did but forerun my need,</p>
<p>And this same needy man must sell it me.</p>
<p>As I remember, this should be the house.</p>
<p>Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.</p>
<p>What, ho! Apothecary!</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<p>Well, Juliet, I’ll lie with you tonight. Let’s see how. Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men! I remember a pharmacist who lives nearby. I remember he wears shabby clothes and has bushy eyebrows. He makes drugs from herbs. He looks poor and miserable and worn out to the bone. He had a tortoise shell hanging up in his shop as well as a stuffed alligator and other skins of strange fish. There were a few empty boxes on his shelves, as well as green clay pots, and some musty seeds. There were a few strands of string and mashed rose petals on display. Noticing all this poverty, I said to myself, “If a man needed some poison”—which they would immediately kill you for selling in Mantua—“here is a miserable wretch who’d sell it to him.” Oh, this idea came before I needed the poison. But this same poor man must sell it to me. As I remember, this should be the house. Today’s a holiday, so the beggar’s shop is shut. Hey! Pharmacist!</p>
