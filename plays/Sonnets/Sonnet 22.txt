      - "My glass shall not persuade me I am old"
      - "So long as youth and thou are of one date;"
      - "But when in thee time’s furrows I behold,"
      - "Then look I death my days should expiate."
      - "For all that beauty that doth cover thee"
      - "Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,"
      - "Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me."
      - "How can I then be elder than thou art?"
      - "O therefore, love, be of thyself so wary"
      - "As I, not for myself, but for thee will,"
      - "Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary"
      - "As tender nurse her babe from faring ill."
      - "  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;"
      - "  Thou gav’st me thine not to give back again."
    m:
      - "I won’t believe my mirror when it tells me I’m old, as long as you’re still young. But when I see you with wrinkles, then I’ll know death is on its way, because your beauty is as close to my heart as beautiful clothing to a body. Put another way, my heart beats in your chest and yours in mine. But if that’s true, then how can I be older than you? Therefore, my love, take care of yourself just as I will take care of myself, not for my own sake, but because I have your heart inside of me, which I will protect as carefully as a nurse her baby. Don’t expect to get your heart back from me when mine is dead. You gave it to me forever, never to be returned."
