    o:
      - "I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so."
      - "Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,"
      - "Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness."
      - "But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee."
      - "And Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see"

      - "And so farewell. I would not have my father"
      - "See me in talk with thee."
    m:
      - "I’m sorry you’re leaving my father like this. It’s hell in our house, and you helped cheer it up, like a funny devil. But goodbye. Here’s a ducat for you. You’ll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper; he’ll be a guest of your new master. Give him this letter. *(gives LAUNCELOT a letter)* Do it secretly. Goodbye. I don’t want my father to see me talking to you."

  - sp: LAUNCELOT
    o:
      - "Adieu! Tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew! If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But adieu. These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit. Adieu."
    m:
      - "Goodbye. My tears show you my feelings, my beautiful pagan, my sweet Jew! I’m sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you. But goodbye. It’s not manly to cry. Goodbye."

  - sp: JESSICA
    o:
      - "Farewell, good Launcelot."
    m:
      - "Goodbye, Launcelot."

  - o:
      - "Alack, what heinous sin is it in me"
      - "To be ashamed to be my father’s child!"
      - "But though I am a daughter to his blood,"
      - "I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,"
      - "If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,"
      - "Become a Christian and thy loving wife."
    m:
      - "Oh God, what a heinous sinner I am, being ashamed to be my father’s child! But I need to remember I’m related to him by blood, not behavior. Oh Lorenzo, if you keep your promise to me, I’ll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "She exits."
