<p>I will tell you.</p>
<p>The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne,</p>
<p>Burned on the water. The poop was beaten gold,</p>
<p>Purple the sails, and so perfumèd that</p>
<p>The winds were lovesick with them. The oars were silver,</p>
<p>Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made</p>
<p>The water which they beat to follow faster,</p>
<p>As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,</p>
<p>It beggared all description: she did lie</p>
<p>In her pavilion—cloth-of-gold, of tissue—</p>
<p>O’erpicturing that Venus where we see</p>
<p>The fancy outwork nature. On each side her</p>
<p>Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,</p>

<p>And what they undid did.</p>
</td>

<p>I’ll tell you. Her barge looked like a golden throne upon the waves, burning bright with the sun’s reflections. The rear deck was covered with hammered gold. The sails were dyed purple, and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love. The oars were made of silver, and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music. As the oars beat the water, the waves seemed to speed up as if excited by lust. Cleopatra’s appearance was indescribable. As she reclined under a canopy woven from gold thread, she was more beautiful than any artist’s idealized portrait of the goddess Venus. Pretty, Cupid-like boys stood on either side of her, smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans, which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them, undoing what they did.</p>

<p>Her ladies-in-waiting—like Nereides, or mermaids—tended to Cleopatra as she watched them, and their graceful movements added to the beauty of the scene. It seemed as if a mermaid were steering. The silken sails and ropes swelled in the wind, expertly handled by the ladies’ soft hands. People on the wharves could smell exotic perfume wafting from the barge as it passed them. All the people came out to see her, and Antony, waiting for her in the marketplace, was left alone. Even the air itself would have gone to look at Cleopatra, if that wouldn’t have caused an unnatural vacuum in the atmosphere.</p>
