<p>Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.—</p>
<p>Ill-spirited Worcester, did not we send grace,</p>
<p>Pardon, and terms of love to all of you?</p>
<p>And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary,</p>
<p>Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman’s trust?</p>
<p>Three knights upon our party slain today,</p>
<p>A noble earl, and many a creature else</p>
<p>Had been alive this hour,</p>

<b>KING</b>
<p>This is how rebellions always end—defeated. Evil-spirited Worcester! Didn’t I offer kindness, forgiveness and friendship to all of you? And you pretended that I did the opposite? Your relatives and friends trusted you, yet you lied to them? Three of our knights who were killed today, a noble earl, and many other men might have been alive right now if you had been a decent man and reported truthfully on the negotiations between our two armies.</p>

<b>PRINCE HENRY</b>
<p>When that brave Scotsman, Lord Douglas, saw that things were turning against him, that Percy had been killed, and that his men were fleeing in terror, he ran away too. He fell down a hill and was so badly injured that our men were able to capture him. He’s being held prisoner at my tent. I ask your highness to let me decide what to do with him.</p>

<b>KING</b>
<p>All that’s left is for us to split up our armies. You, my son John, and you, Westmoreland, head towards York as quickly as you can. Confront Northumberland and that churchman the Archbishop, who, I gather, are raising armies against us. You and I, Harry my son, will head for Wales to fight Glendower and Mortimer. The rebellion in this land will break apart once it meets battles like the one we fought today. And since we have accomplished our business so well, let’s not quit until everything has been won.</p>
