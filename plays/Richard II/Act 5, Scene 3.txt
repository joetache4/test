    o:
      - "Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?"
      - "’Tis full three months since I did see him last;"
      - "If any plague hang over us, ’tis he."
      - "I would to God, my lords, he might be found:"
      - "Inquire at London, ’mongst the taverns there,"
      - "For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,"
      - "With unrestrained loose companions,"
      - "Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,"
      - "And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;"
      - "Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,"
      - "Takes on the point of honour to support"
      - "So dissolute a crew."
    m:
      - "Can’t anyone tell me about my irresponsible son? It’s been three months since I last saw him. He’s the only trouble in my life. I want him found. Ask in London, around the bars there. They say he goes to them every day with immoral friends, the kind of people who ambush passersby in the street and beat and rob the guards. My pleasure-seeking son thinks it’s a badge of honor to support such an awful crowd."

  - sp: HENRY PERCY
    o:
      - "My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,"
      - "And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford."
    m:
      - "My lord, two days ago I saw the prince and told him about the celebration at Oxford."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "And what said the gallant?"
    m:
      - "And what did he say?"

  - sp: HENRY PERCY
    o:
      - "His answer was, he would unto the stews,"
      - "And from the common’st creature pluck a glove,"
      - "And wear it as a favour; and with that"
      - "He would unhorse the lustiest challenger."
    m:
      - "He said that he would go to the whorehouse and get a glove from the most promiscuous whore there to wear as a favor. And then he would win in the jousts."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "As dissolute as desperate; yet through both"
      - "I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years"
      - "May happily bring forth. But who comes here?"
    m:
      - "Even if he is immoral and reckless, I still see some hope that his better qualities will emerge as he gets older. But who is approaching?"

  - os: "Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE"

    o:
      - "What means our cousin, that he stares and looks"
      - "So wildly?"
    m:
      - "Why does my cousin stare and look about him so wildly?"

  - sp: DUKE OF AUMERLE
    o:
      - "God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,"
      - "To have some conference with your grace alone."
    m:
      - "God save your grace! I beg to speak to you alone."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE

  - sp: DUKE OF AUMERLE
    o:
      - "For ever may my knees grow to the earth,"
      - "My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth"
      - "Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak."
    m:
      - "May my knees remain on the ground and my tongue stay silent until you give me your forgiveness."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Intended or committed was this fault?"
      - "If on the first, how heinous e’er it be,"
      - "To win thy after-love I pardon thee."
    m:
      - "Is it an offense that you have committed or that you planned to commit? If it was planned only, no matter how terrible it is, I’ll forgive you in order to win your love."

  - sp: DUKE OF AUMERLE
    o:
      - "Then give me leave that I may turn the key,"
      - "That no man enter till my tale be done."
    m:
      - "Then let me lock the door so no one else can come in until I’m finished telling you."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Have thy desire."
    m:
      - "Go ahead."

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "*(Within)* My liege, beware; look to thyself;"
      - "Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there."
    m:
      - "*(speaking from off-stage)* My lord, beware. Watch yourself. You have a traitor with you."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE

    m:
      - "Hold off from your revenge. You don’t have any reason to be afraid."

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "*(Within)* Open the door, secure, foolhardy king:"
      - "Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?"
      - "Open the door, or I will break it open."
    m:
      - "*(speaking from off-stage)* Open the door, my foolish king. Should I harshly criticize you out of love for you? Open the door, or I’ll break it down."

  - os: "Enter DUKE OF YORK"
    ms: "The DUKE OF YORK enters."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "What is the matter, uncle? speak;"
      - "Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,"
      - "That we may arm us to encounter it."
    m:
      - "What is the matter, uncle? Tell me. Catch your breath. Tell me how close the danger is so that I can prepare for it."

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know"
      - "The treason that my haste forbids me show."
    m:
      - "Read this, and you’ll know what treason made me hurry so fast that I can hardly speak."

  - sp: DUKE OF AUMERLE
    o:
      - "Remember, as thou read’st, thy promise pass’d:"
      - "I do repent me; read not my name there"
      - "My heart is not confederate with my hand."
    m:
      - "Remember, as you read, what you just promised. I already regret it. Don’t read my name there. My heart doesn’t match what my hand wrote."

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down."
      - "I tore it from the traitor’s bosom, king;"
      - "Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:"
      - "Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove"
      - "A serpent that will sting thee to the heart."
    m:
      - "Villain, your heart believed it before your hand wrote it. I took the paper from the traitor, king. He regrets it out of fear, not out of love for you. Don’t pity him, because that pity will come back to harm you."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!"
      - "O loyal father of a treacherous son!"
      - "Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,"
      - "From when this stream through muddy passages"
      - "Hath held his current and defiled himself!"
      - "Thy overflow of good converts to bad,"
      - "And thy abundant goodness shall excuse"
      - "This deadly blot in thy digressing son."
    m:
      - "Oh, what a terrible and bold conspiracy! Oh, loyal father of a treacherous son! Your pure goodness overwhelms the wrongdoing of your foul son. Because you have proven yourself so loyal, I’ll forgive your son’s damnable crime."

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "So shall my virtue be his vice’s bawd;"
      - "And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,"
      - "As thriftless sons their scraping fathers’ gold."
      - "Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,"
      - "Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:"
      - "Thou kill’st me in his life; giving him breath,"
      - "The traitor lives, the true man’s put to death."
    m:
      - "So my virtue will pay for his vice, and as some bad sons spend all their fathers’ money, he’ll spend all my honor with his shame. My honor can only live if his dishonor dies, otherwise I will live in shame. By forgiving him you are killing me. If he lives, so does a traitor, and the loyal man is put to death."

  - sp: DUCHESS OF YORK
    o:
      - "*(Within)* What ho, my liege! for God’s sake,"
      - "let me in."
    m:
      - "*(speaking from off-stage)* Hello, my lord! For God’s sake, let me in."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?"
    m:
      - "What screeching beggar is there?"

  - sp: DUCHESS OF YORK
    o:
      - "A woman, and thy aunt, great king; ’tis I."
      - "Speak with me, pity me, open the door."
      - "A beggar begs that never begg’d before."
    m:
      - "A woman and your aunt, great king. It’s me. Please pity me. Open the door and talk to me. I, who have never begged before, am now a beggar."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Our scene is alter’d from a serious thing,"
      - "And now changed to “The Beggar and the King.”"
      - "My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:"
      - "I know she is come to pray for your foul sin."
    m:
      - "Suddenly the scene has changed from something serious to “The Beggar and the King.”My dangerous cousin, let your mother in. I know that she’s come to beg forgiveness for your terrible crime."

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,"
      - "More sins for this forgiveness prosper may."
      - "This fester’d joint cut off, the rest rest sound;"
      - "This let alone will all the rest confound."
    m:
      - "No matter who prays, if you forgive this crime, only more will follow. By cutting off this infected limb you’ll keep the rest of the body healthy. It’s the only way to keep this sickness from spreading."

  - os: "Enter DUCHESS OF YORK"
    ms: "The DUCHESS OF YORK enters."

  - sp: DUCHESS OF YORK
    o:
      - "O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!"
      - "Love loving not itself none other can."
    m:
      - "Oh, king, don’t believe this hardhearted man! If he can’t love his son, he is incapable of loving anyone."

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?"
      - "Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?"
    m:
      - "You crazy woman, what are you doing here? Are you going to nurse another traitor with your old breasts?"

  - sp: DUCHESS OF YORK
    o:
      - "Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege."
    m:
      - "Sweet York, be patient. Gentle king, listen to me."

  - os: "Kneels"
    ms: "She kneels."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Rise up, good aunt."
    m:
      - "Get up, good aunt."

  - sp: DUCHESS OF YORK
    o:
      - "Not yet, I thee beseech:"
      - "For ever will I walk upon my knees,"
      - "And never see day that the happy sees,"
      - "Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,"
      - "By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy."
    m:
      - "Not yet, I beg you. I’ll stay on my knees and never look up again until you give me joy by forgiving Rutland, my wayward son."

  - sp: DUKE OF AUMERLE
    o:
      - "Unto my mother’s prayers I bend my knee."
    m:
      - "I’ll kneel, too, in support of my mother’s prayers."

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "Against them both my true joints bended be."
      - "Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!"
    m:
      - "I’ll kneel to oppose them. If you forgive him, you’ll only nurture more bad deeds."

  - sp: DUCHESS OF YORK
    o:
      - "Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;"
      - "His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;"
      - "His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:"
      - "He prays but faintly and would be denied;"
      - "We pray with heart and soul and all beside:"
      - "His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;"
      - "Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:"
      - "His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;"
      - "Ours of true zeal and deep integrity."
      - "Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have"
      - "That mercy which true prayer ought to have."
    m:
      - "Is he serious? Look at his face. He’s not crying. His prayers are a joke. His words come from his mouth, but ours come from our hearts. He prays softly, hoping to be denied. We pray with heart and soul and all our bodies. I know his old and tired knees would like to straighten up. We’ll stay kneeling till our knees grow roots in the ground. His prayers are hypocritical, while ours are full of true desire and integrity. Our prayers are more prayer-like than his, so let our prayers be rewarded as they ought to be, with mercy."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Good aunt, stand up."
    m:
      - "Good aunt, stand up."

  - sp: DUCHESS OF YORK
    o:
      - "Nay, do not say, “stand up;”"
      - "Say, “pardon” first, and afterwards “stand up.”"
      - "And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,"
      - "“Pardon” should be the first word of thy speech."
      - "I never long’d to hear a word till now;"
      - "Say “pardon,” king; let pity teach thee how:"
      - "The word is short, but not so short as sweet;"
      - "No word like “pardon” for kings’ mouths so meet."
    m:
      - "No, don’t say, “Stand up.” First say, “I forgive,” and then you can tell me to stand up. If I were your nanny, the first word I would teach you would be “pardon.” I’ve never wanted to hear a word so badly. Say “pardon,” king. Let pity teach you how. The word is short and sweeter than it is short. It’s the most fitting word for a king to say."

  - sp: DUKE OF YORK
    o:
      - "Speak it in French, king; say, “pardonne moi.”"
    m:
      - "Say it in French, king. Say, “Pardonne moi.”"

  - sp: DUCHESS OF YORK
    o:
      - "Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?"
      - "Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,"
      - "That set’st the word itself against the word!"
      - "Speak “pardon” as ’tis current in our land;"
      - "The chopping French we do not understand."
      - "Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;"
      - "Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;"
      - "That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,"
      - "Pity may move thee “pardon” to rehearse."
    m:
      - "Do you try to destroy forgiveness by teaching that pardon? Oh, my sour husband, my hardhearted lord, you’d make that word the opposite of what it means. Say “pardon” in English. We don’t understand French. I can see it in your eyes, so let your tongue say it. Listen to the pity in your heart with your ears, which our laments and prayers pierce, so that pity may move you to say “pardon.”"

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "Good aunt, stand up."
    m:
      - "Good aunt, stand up."

  - sp: DUCHESS OF YORK
    o:
      - "I do not sue to stand;"
      - "Pardon is all the suit I have in hand."
    m:
      - "I’m not begging to stand. All I want is a pardon."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "I pardon him, as God shall pardon me."
    m:
      - "I pardon him, as God will one day pardon me."

  - sp: DUCHESS OF YORK
    o:
      - "O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!"
      - "Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;"
      - "Twice saying “pardon” doth not pardon twain,"
      - "But makes one pardon strong."
    m:
      - "Oh, the happy view from a bended knee! But I’m still fearful. Say it again. Saying it twice doesn’t divide your pardon and weaken it but makes the one pardon stronger."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "With all my heart"
      - "I pardon him."
    m:
      - "With all my heart, I pardon him."

  - sp: DUCHESS OF YORK
    o:
      - "A god on earth thou art."
    m:
      - "You are a god on earth."

  - sp: HENRY BOLINGBROKE
    o:
      - "But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,"
      - "With all the rest of that consorted crew,"
      - "Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels."
      - "Good uncle, help to order several powers"
      - "To Oxford, or where’er these traitors are:"
      - "They shall not live within this world, I swear,"
      - "But I will have them, if I once know where."
      - "Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:"
      - "Your mother well hath pray’d, and prove you true."
    m:
      - "But my trusted brother-in-law, the abbot, and all the rest of that group of conspirators must be destroyed. Good uncle, send several men to Oxford or wherever these traitors are hiding. I swear that as long as they are alive, I will find them and capture them. Uncle, goodbye, and goodbye cousin, too. Your mother has prayed well and proved your loyalty."

  - sp: DUCHESS OF YORK
    o:
      - "Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new."
    m:
      - "Come, my son. I’ll pray that God forces you to reform."
