<p>This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant</p>
<p>And dull to all proceedings. A deflower’d maid!</p>
<p>And by an eminent body that enforced</p>
<p>The law against it! But that her tender shame</p>
<p>Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,</p>
<p>How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;</p>
<p>For my authority bears of a credent bulk,</p>
<p>That no particular scandal once can touch</p>
<p>But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,</p>
<p>Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,</p>
<p>Might in the times to come have ta’en revenge,</p>
<p>By so receiving a dishonour’d life</p>
<p>With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!</p>
<p>A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,</p>
<p>Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<p>This thing I’ve done has totally destroyed me. I’m stupid, can’t concentrate on anything. A girl robbed of her virginity, and by a respected public figure who enforced the law against sex! If she weren’t too ashamed to admit it, she could easily denounce me! But her head tells her not to, because my credibility is so strong that any scandal would ruin the person who spreads it, not me. I would’ve let Claudio live, except that a hotheaded youth like him might have come after me someday, feeling that his life is dishonored because he paid such a shameful price for it. Even so, I wish I’d let him live. Sadly, nothing goes right once we forget virtue. I don’t do the good thing, which I don’t want to do, but the evil I don’t want to commit, that I do.</p>
