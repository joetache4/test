<p>Caesar, I never believed in omens, but now they frighten me. A servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too, but different ones from what we heard and saw. A lioness gave birth in the streets, and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead. Fierce, fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war—ranks and squadrons—until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol. The noise of battle filled the air, and horses neighed, and dying men groaned, and ghosts shrieked and squealed in the streets. Oh, Caesar! These things are beyond anything we’ve seen before, and I’m afraid.</p>

<p>Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,</p>

<p>Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck</p>

<b>DECIUS</b>
<p>This dream has been interpreted all wrong. It was a good and lucky vision.
