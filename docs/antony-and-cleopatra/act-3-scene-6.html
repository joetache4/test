<p>In Alexandria he condemned Rome, and that’s not all. This is what happened: he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace.

Antony confirmed her possession of Egypt and made her absolute Queen of lower Syria, Cyprus, and Lydia.</p>

<p>Why have you stol’n upon us thus? You come not</p>

<p>Raised by your populous troops. But you are come</p>
<p>A market-maid to Rome and have prevented</p>
<p>The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,</p>

<p>Then why did you travel so quietly? You didn’t arrive like Caesar’s sister. Antony’s wife should have an army to escort her, with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears. The trees along the road should have been filled with eager spectators. Crowds should have been faint with excitement waiting to see you. The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven. But you’ve arrived like a common maid bringing goods to a Roman market. You’ve kept me from displaying my love—and when love is not shown, it’s often not felt. I would have met you by sea and again by land. At each stage of your trip there would have been a more spectacular greeting.</p>
