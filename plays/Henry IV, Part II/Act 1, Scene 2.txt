  - os: "Enter Sir John FALSTAFF, with his PAGE bearing his sword and buckler"
    ms: "Sir John FALSTAFF enters with his PAGE, who carries a sword and shield."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?"
    m:
      - "Sirrah, you giant, what did the doctor say about my urine?"

  - sp: PAGE
    o:
      - "He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water, but,"
      - "for the party that owed it, he might have more diseases than"
      - "he knew for."
    m:
      - "He said that the urine itself was good, healthy urine, but that the man who owned it probably had more diseases than he could tell."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain of this"
      - "foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent"
      - "anything that tends to laughter more than I invent, or is"
      - "invented on me. I am not only witty in myself, but the cause"
      - "that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath"
      - "overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the Prince put"
      - "thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off,"
      - "why then I have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake,"
      - "thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels."
      - "I was never manned with an agate till now, but I will inset"
      - "you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send"
      - "you back again to your master for a jewel. The juvenal, the"
      - "Prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledge—I will"
      - "sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he"
      - "shall get one off his cheek, and yet he will not stick to say"
      - "his face is a face royal. God may finish it when He will. ’Tis"
      - "not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still at a face royal, for"
      - "a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it, and yet he’ll be"
      - "crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was"
      - "a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but he’s almost out of"
      - "mine, I can assure him. What said Master Dommelton about"
      - "the satin for my short cloak and my slops?"
    m:
      - "All kinds of people make it a matter of pride to heckle me. No man—that foolishly assembled lump of clay—could ever invent something quite as funny as I seem to be to other people. I’m not only witty on my own, but I bring out wit in other people. Look at the two of us, walking here: I look like a sow that’s smothered all of her baby pigs, except for you. If the Prince sent you to serve me for any other reason than to irritate me, I’m a fool. You weedy little son of a bitch: you’re so tiny that you should be a decoration on my hat, not a servant at my feet. I’ve never had a servant before who was as tiny as a ring stone. But I won’t set you in a gold or silver ring; I’ll wrap you in rags and send you back to your master, to be used as a jewel—that youth, the Prince your master, whose chin is still lacking a beard. Why, I’ll grow a beard in the palm of my hand before he’ll have one that he can shave off his face. And yet, this doesn’t stop him from claiming that he has a face for royalty. Well, God will give him a beard whenever he chooses to—there’s not a hair out of place yet. It’s a good thing the Prince’s face is a royal, because a barber will never earn a coin from shaving it. And still, the Prince brags that he’s been a full-grown man since before he was born. He can keep that title, for all I care; I have no affection for him now, I can assure him. What did Master Dommelton say about the satin for my cape and baggy trousers?"

  - sp: PAGE
    o:
      - "He said, sir, you should procure him better assurance than"
      - "Bardolph. He would not take his band and yours. He liked"
      - "not the security."
    m:
      - "He said that you have to give him a better guarantee of payment than just saying Bardolph was good for it. He wouldn’t accept Bardolph’s promise or yours; he felt that neither should be trusted."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Let him be damned like the glutton! Pray God his tongue be"
      - "hotter! A whoreson Achitophel, a rascally yea-forsooth"
      - "knave, to bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon"
      - "security! The whoreson smoothy-pates do now wear"
      - "nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles;"
      - "and if a man is through with them in honest taking up, then"
      - "they must stand upon security. I had as lief they would put"
      - "ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with “security.” I"
      - "looked he should have sent me two-and-twenty yards of"
      - "satin, as I am a true knight, and he sends me “security.” Well,"
      - "he may sleep in security, for he hath the horn of abundance,"
      - "and the lightness of his wife shines through it, and yet cannot"
      - "he see though he have his own lantern to light him."
      - "Where’s"
      - "Bardolph?"
    m:
      - "Damn him to hell then, just like Dives in the Bible—the rich glutton who rejected the beggar Lazarus! And may Dommelton burn even hotter! He’s a son-of-a-bitch traitor! A two-faced liar, who smiles and says “Yes sir, that’ll be fine” to my face, and then demands a guarantee of payment! These bastard shopkeepers, with their fashionable short haircuts, and fancy shoes, and their fat key chains on their belts—you make an agreement to put something on credit, and then they throw a “guarantee of payment” at you. I would rather eat rat poison than guarantee my payment. I expected him to send me twenty-two yards of satin, and instead he sends me a “guarantee of payment.” Well, let him guarantee himself a good night’s sleep. After all, his wife’s in somebody else’s bed, so why not? She’s practically shining a spotlight on her adultery, but he’s so clueless he can’t even tell. Where’s Bardolph?"

  - sp: PAGE
    o:
      - "He’s gone into Smithfield to buy your Worship a horse."
    m:
      - "He went to Smithfield to buy you a horse, sir."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "I bought him in Paul’s, and he’ll buy me a horse in"
      - "Smithfield. An I could get me but a wife in the stews, I were"
      - "manned, horsed, and wived."
    m:
      - "I bought Bardolph at St. Paul’s Cathedral, and he’s buying me a horse in Smithfield. Now if he could just find me a wife in a whorehouse, I’d be fully stocked with high-quality servants, horses, and wives."

  - os: "Enter the Lord CHIEF JUSTICE and SERVANT"
    ms: "The Lord CHIEF JUSTICE and his SERVANT enter."

  - sp: PAGE
    o:
      - "Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the Prince for striking"
      - "him about Bardolph."
    m:
      - "Sir, here comes the man who put the Prince in jail for hitting him during that argument about Bardolph."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Wait close. I will not see him."
    m:
      - "Hide; I don’t want to talk to him."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "What’s he that goes there?"
    m:
      - "Who is that man?"

  - sp: SERVANT
    o:
      - "Falstaff, an ’t please your Lordship."
    m:
      - "Falstaff, if it please you, sir."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "He that was in question for the robbery?"
    m:
      - "The man who was a suspect in that robbery?"

  - sp: SERVANT
    o:
      - "He, my lord; but he hath since done good service at"
      - "Shrewsbury, and, as I hear, is now going with some charge to the Lord John of Lancaster."
    m:
      - "That’s the one. But he did good work in the Battle of Shrewsbury, and I hear he’s taking some soldiers to help Lord John of Lancaster."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "What, to York? Call him back again."
    m:
      - "Where, to York? Tell him to come here."

  - sp: SERVANT
    o:
      - "Sir John Falstaff!"
    m:
      - "Sir John Falstaff!"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Boy, tell him I am deaf."
    m:
      - "Boy, tell him I’m deaf."

  - sp: PAGE
    o:
      - "You must speak louder. My master is deaf."
    m:
      - "You have to speak up; my master is deaf."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.—Go pluck"
      - "him by the elbow. I must speak with him."
    m:
      - "I’m sure he is, when anything good’s being said. Go, tap him on the shoulder. I must speak with him."

  - sp: SERVANT
    o:
      - "Sir John!"
    m:
      - "Sir John!"

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "What, a young knave and begging? Is there not wars? Is"
      - "there not employment? Doth not the King lack subjects? Do"
      - "not the rebels need soldiers? Though it be a shame to be on"
      - "any side but one, it is worse shame to beg than to be on the"
      - "worst side, were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell"
      - "how to make it."
    m:
      - "What? A young troublemaker? A beggar? Isn’t there a war on? Isn’t there work to do? Doesn’t the King need subjects? Don’t the rebels need soldiers? Though it’s shameful to be on any side but the King’s, it’s even more shameful to be an idle beggar than a soldier on wrong side—even if the rebellion were more despicable than the word “rebellion” already leads me to believe."

  - sp: SERVANT
    o:
      - "You mistake me, sir."
    m:
      - "You’re mistaken, sir."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Why sir, did I say you were an honest man? Setting my"
      - "knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied in my throat"
      - "if I had said so."
    m:
      - "Why is that? Did I say you were an honest man? Because, setting aside the fact that I’m knight and a soldier, I’d be nothing but a liar if I said that."

  - sp: SERVANT
    o:
      - "I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our soldiership"
      - "aside, and give me leave to tell you, you lie in your throat if"
      - "you say I am any other than an honest man."
    m:
      - "Then please, sir, set aside your knighthood and your soldiership and let me tell you that you’re a deliberate liar, if you say I’m anything other than an honest man."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "I give thee leave to tell me so? I lay aside that which grows"
      - "to me? If thou gett’st any leave of me, hang me; if thou tak’st"
      - "leave, thou wert better be hanged. You hunt counter. Hence!"
      - "Avaunt!"
    m:
      - "Should I allow you to say that? Should I set aside something that’s mine by right? If I allow you anything, hang me. If you allow yourself, hang you. You’re running in the wrong direction: get out of here! Go!"

  - sp: SERVANT
    o:
      - "Sir, my lord would speak with you."
    m:
      - "Sir, my master wants to speak with you."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "Sir John Falstaff, a word with you."
    m:
      - "Sir John Falstaff, I’d like a word with you."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "My good lord. God give your Lordship good time of the day."
      - "I am glad to see your Lordship abroad. I heard say your"
      - "Lordship was sick: I hope your Lordship goes abroad by"
      - "advice. Your Lordship, though not clean past your youth,"
      - "have yet some smack of an ague in you, some relish of the"
      - "saltness of time in you, and I most humbly beseech your"
      - "Lordship to have a reverent care of your health."
    m:
      - "My good sir! God grant you a good day! It’s great to see you out and about: I’d heard you were sick. I hope your doctor knows you’re out. Though you’re not entirely past your youth, your lordship, you have a touch of age in you, a touch of the passage of time, and I must humbly urge you to take good care of your health."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to"
      - "Shrewsbury."
    m:
      - "Sir John, I sent for you to come see me before you left for Shrewsbury."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "An ’t please your Lordship, I hear his Majesty is returned"
      - "with some discomfort from Wales."
    m:
      - "If you don’t mind my saying so, I hear the King is back from Wales and it didn’t go so well."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "I talk not of his Majesty. You would not come when I sent"
      - "for you."
    m:
      - "I’m not talking about the King. You didn’t come when I sent for you."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "And I hear, moreover, his Highness is fallen into this same"
      - "whoreson apoplexy."
    m:
      - "And I also hear that the King has fallen into a terrible paralysis."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "Well, God mend him. I pray you let me speak with you."
    m:
      - "Well, God give him a speedy recovery. Please, let me speak with you."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "This apoplexy, as I take it, is a kind of lethargy, an ’t please"
      - "your Lordship, a kind of sleeping in the blood, a whoreson"
      - "tingling."
    m:
      - "His paralysis is, as I understand it, a kind of lethargy, if it please you. It’s a sleepiness in the blood, a nasty tingling."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "What tell you me of it? Be it as it is."
    m:
      - "Why are you telling me this? Let it be."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "It hath its original from much grief, from study, and"
      - "perturbation of the brain. I have read the cause of his effects"
      - "in Galen. It is a kind of deafness."
    m:
      - "It comes from heavy sadness; from too much reading, and too much thinking. I read about it in the reference books: it’s a kind of deafness."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "I think you are fallen into the disease, for you hear not what"
      - "I say to you."
    m:
      - "I think you must have that disease as well, because you’re not hearing a word I’m saying."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Very well, my lord, very well. Rather, an ’t please you, it is"
      - "the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking, that"
      - "I am troubled withal."
    m:
      - "Very likely, my lord, very likely. But actually, sir, I have the not-listening disease; I have the not-paying-attention sickness."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of"
      - "your ears, and I care not if I do become your physician."
    m:
      - "The cure for that illness would be to put you in shackles, and I wouldn’t mind being your doctor."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient. Your"
      - "Lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in"
      - "respect of poverty, but how should I be your patient to follow"
      - "your prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a"
      - "scruple, or indeed a scruple itself."
    m:
      - "I may be as poor as Job, but I’m not as patient. You may be able to throw me in jail because of my poverty, but some people might have slight reservations about that."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "I sent for you, when there were matters against you for your"
      - "life, to come speak with me."
    m:
      - "I sent for you to come speak with me. There were charges against you that might have earned you the death penalty."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of"
      - "this land-service, I did not come."
    m:
      - "I was advised that, since I was working for the army at the time, I shouldn’t go."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy."
    m:
      - "The truth is, Sir John, that you are massively notorious."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less."
    m:
      - "Anybody who wears a belt this big couldn’t be anything less than massive."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "Your means are very slender, and your waste is great."
    m:
      - "Your bank account is thin, and yet you put it to huge waste."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "I would it were otherwise. I would my means were greater"
      - "and my waist slender."
    m:
      - "I wish it were the other way around: that my bank account were huge and my waist were thin."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "You have misled the youthful Prince."
    m:
      - "You’ve misled the young Prince."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "The young Prince hath misled me. I am the fellow with the"
      - "great belly, and he my dog."
    m:
      - "The young Prince has misled me. I’m the man with the big belly, and he’s the dog who walks in front of me."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound. Your day’s"
      - "service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night’s"
      - "exploit on Gad’s Hill. You may thank th’ unquiet time for"
      - "your quiet o’erposting that action."
    m:
      - "Well, I’d rather not open up a wound that’s just healed. The good work you did at Shrewsbury has made up a little for the bad thing you did at Gad’s Hill. You can thank the rebellion for helping you get away with that terrible deed."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "My lord."
    m:
      - "Really?"

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "But since all is well, keep it so. Wake not a sleeping wolf."
    m:
      - "But since things are calm now, let’s keep them that way. We won’t wake a sleeping wolf."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox."
    m:
      - "To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "What, you are as a candle, the better part burnt out."
    m:
      - "What? You’re like a candle, half burned out."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow. If I did say of wax, my"
      - "growth would approve the truth."
    m:
      - "Maybe, if I were a big, fat holiday candle made of animal fat. But you’d be better off saying that I’m a wax candle: I keep “waxing” larger and larger."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "There is not a white hair on your face but should have his"
      - "effect of gravity."
    m:
      - "Your gray beard should be a sign that you’re a man of gravity."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy."
    m:
      - "I’m a man of gravy, gravy, gravy."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "You follow the young Prince up and down like his ill angel."
    m:
      - "You follow the young Prince everywhere, like a false angel on his shoulder."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "Not so, my lord. Your ill angel is light, but I hope he that"
      - "looks upon me will take me without weighing. And yet in"
      - "some respects I grant I cannot go. I cannot tell. Virtue is of"
      - "so little regard in these costermongers’ times that true valor"
      - "is turned bear-herd; pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath his"
      - "quick wit wasted in giving reckonings. All the other gifts"
      - "appurtenant to man, as the malice of this age shapes them,"
      - "are not worth a gooseberry. You that are old consider not the"
      - "capacities of us that are young. You do measure the heat of"
      - "our livers with the bitterness of your galls, and we that are in"
      - "the vaward of our youth, I must confess, are wags too."
    m:
      - "That’s not so, my lord. False angels are light, and anyone can see without having to weigh me that I’m too heavy. But I don’t know; in some ways, you’re right. I’m not for these times. Virtue counts for so little in this commercial world of ours. True courage is worthless; it’s only used by animal trainers in the bear-baiting rings. Intelligence is good for nobody but bartenders, who waste their wits totaling up tavern bills. In these mean-spirited days, man’s best qualities aren’t worth a thing. You older folks don’t value us young people. You measure our fiery passion according to your melancholic bitterness. And I have to tell you, those of us who are highly advanced in our youth, we’re spirited as well as young."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are"
      - "written down old with all the characters of age? Have you"
      - "not a moist eye, a dry hand, a yellow cheek, a white beard,"
      - "a decreasing leg, an increasing belly? Is not your voice"
      - "broken, your wind short, your chin double, your wit single,"
      - "and every part about you blasted with antiquity? And will"
      - "you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John."
    m:
      - "You’d add your name to the list of the young? You, who have age written all over you? Don’t you have mucus in your eyes? Dry skin? Jaundice? A white beard? An arthritic leg? A growing belly? Isn’t your voice scratchy? Your breath short? Your chin doubled? Your last wit abandoned? Isn’t every part of you devastated by age? And still you call yourself young? Shame on you, Sir John."

  - sp: FALSTAFF
    o:
      - "My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon,"
      - "with a white head and something a round belly. For my"
      - "voice, I have lost it with halloing and singing of anthems. To"
      - "approve my youth further, I will not. The truth is, I am only"
      - "old in judgment and understanding. And he that will caper"
      - "with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money,"
      - "and have at him! For the box of the ear that the Prince gave"
      - "you, he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a"
      - "sensible lord. I have checked him for it, and the young lion"
      - "repents. Marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk and old sack."
    m:
      - "Sir, I was born around three o’clock in the afternoon, with a white head and a bit of a round belly. As for my scratchy voice, I lost it through shouting and singing loud songs. But I won’t try to prove how young I am any longer. I have only one trait of old age, and that is wisdom. If somebody wants to challenge me to a dance contest for a thousand-mark wager, let him hand me the money and off we go. Now, as for the fact that the Prince hit you on the head, he did it like a rude prince and you took it like a sensible gentleman. I reprimanded him for it, and he repents. He’s not wearing the traditional sackcloth and ashes, for sure, but he’s repenting in silk cloth and wine."

  - sp: CHIEF JUSTICE
    o:
      - "Well, God send the Prince a better companion."
    m:
      - "May God send the Prince a better friend!"

  - sp: FALSTAFF

    m:
      - "Yes, and thanks for reminding me. I hope that all of you who stay home, safe and sound, will say a prayer that we soldiers don’t end up in some hot battle. For, by the Lord, I’ve only packed two shirts, and I don’t want to sweat too much. If things get hot and I pull out any other weapon besides a bottle, I’ll never drink wine again. I get sent out on every dangerous assignment that comes up. Well, I can’t live forever. That’s the thing about the English: when they have something good, they use it continually. If you’re going to insist that I’m an old man, then let me rest. I wish to God the enemy weren’t as scared of me as they are: I’d rather sit and rust than be worn out by all this work."
