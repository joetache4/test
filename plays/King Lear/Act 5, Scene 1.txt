    m:
      - "My dear and loving sister-in-law, I’m happy to see you. *(to EDMUND)* Sir, I’ve heard that the king has joined up with his daughter as well as others who have complained about our strict policies. I’ve never fought for a cause I didn’t believe in. I’m concerned about the French because they have invaded our soil, not because they support King Lear or those others—who, I’m afraid, may have legitimate grievances against us."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "Sir, you speak nobly."
    m:
      - "Noble words, sir."

  - sp: REGAN
    o:
      - "  Why is this reasoned?"
    m:
      - "Why are we talking about this?"

  - sp: GONERIL
    o:
      - "Combine together ’gainst the enemy,"
      - "For these domestic and particular broils"
      - "Are not the question here."
    m:

      - "Your business of the world hath so an end,"
      - "And machination ceases. Fortune love you."
    m:
      - "*(giving ALBANY a letter)* Before you go into battle, open this letter. If you win, then blow your trumpet as a signal for me. I may look wretched, but I’ll bravely stand up to defend my claims. If you die in battle, all your projects and this plan are off. Good luck to you."

  - sp: ALBANY
    o:
      - "Stay till I have read the letter."
    m:
      - "Wait until I read the letter."

  - sp: EDGAR
    o:
      - "I was forbid it."
      - "When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,"
      - "And I’ll appear again."
    m:
      - "I was ordered not to. When the time comes, tell the herald to blow the trumpet and I’ll return."

  - sp: ALBANY
    o:
      - "Why, fare thee well. I will o’erlook thy paper."
    m:
      - "Goodbye, then. I’ll take a look at your letter."

  - os: "Exit EDGAR"
    ms: "EDGAR exits."

  - os: "Enter EDMUND"

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "The enemy’s in view. Draw up your powers."
      - "*(gives ALBANY a document)*"
      - "Here is the guess of their true strength and forces"
      - "By diligent discovery, but your haste"
      - "Is now urged on you."
    m:
      - "The enemy’s in sight. Prepare your troops. *(gives ALBANY a document)* The reconnaissance operation has returned this estimate of the enemy’s manpower and weaponry. But now, please hurry."

  - sp: ALBANY
    o:
      - "  We will greet the time."
    m:
      - "We’ll be ready when the time comes."

  - os: "Exit ALBANY"
    ms: "He exits."

  - sp: EDMUND
    o:
      - "To both these sisters have I sworn my love,"
      - "Each jealous of the other as the stung"
      - "Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?"
      - "Both? One? Or neither? Neither can be enjoyed"
      - "If both remain alive. To take the widow"
      - "Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril,"
      - "And hardly shall I carry out my side,"
      - "Her husband being alive. Now, then, we’ll use"
      - "His countenance for the battle, which being done,"
      - "Let her who would be rid of him devise"
      - "His speedy taking off. As for the mercy"
      - "Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,"
      - "The battle done and they within our power,"
      - "Shall never see his pardon, for my state"
      - "Stands on me to defend, not to debate."
    m:
      - "I’ve sworn my love to both of these sisters. They’re jealous of each other like poisonous snakes. Which one of them should I pick? Both? One? Neither? I can’t enjoy either of them as long as the other one’s alive. Goneril would go crazy if I chose Regan, but it would be hard to get in with Goneril while her husband’s still alive. I’ll use Albany’s power and authority for now to win the war, but afterward one of the sisters—whichever one wants to—can get rid of him. Albany wants to spare Lear and Cordelia, but once they are my prisoners after the battle, they won’t stay alive long enough to see his pardon. I have to defend my position with actions, not words."

  - os: "Exit"
    ms: "He exits."
