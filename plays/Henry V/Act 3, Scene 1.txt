      - "In peace there’s nothing so becomes a man"
      - "As modest stillness and humility,"
      - "But when the blast of war blows in our ears,"
      - "Then imitate the action of the tiger:"
      - "Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,"
      - "Disguise fair nature with hard-favored rage,"
      - "Then lend the eye a terrible aspect,"

      - "That those whom you called fathers did beget you."
      - "Be copy now to men of grosser blood,"
      - "And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,"
      - "Whose limbs were made in England, show us here"
      - "The mettle of your pasture. Let us swear"
      - "That you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not,"
      - "For there is none of you so mean and base"
      - "That hath not noble luster in your eyes."
      - "I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,"
      - "Straining upon the start. The game’s afoot."
      - "Follow your spirit, and upon this charge"
      - "Cry “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”"
    m:
      - "Attack the breach in the city wall once more, dear friends, attack it once more—or else let’s close it up with English corpses. In peacetime, nothing looks better in a man than restraint and humility. But when the battle trumpet blows in our ears, then it’s time to act like the tiger. With muscles taut and blood stirred up, hide your civilized nature under the guise of ugly rage. Lend your eyes a terrifying gleam and let them jut out from the portholes of the head like brass cannon. Make your brow jut out over your eyes like a frightening cliff over the wild and desolate ocean. Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare. Take a deep breath and draw on every impulse to its fullest strength. On, on, you noblest Englishmen, descended as you are from battle-tested fathers, fathers who, like so many Alexander the Greats, have fought in these regions from morning until night, sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight. Don’t dishonor your mothers! Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you. Serve as an example to men of common birth and teach them how to fight. And you, good farmers, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the vigor of your upbringing. Prove you are worthy of your birth, which I do not doubt for a moment. For there isn’t one of you so low-born that your eyes don’t shine with noble luster. I see you’re standing like greyhounds on a leash, straining for the moment when you’ll be let loose. The hunt is on! Follow your spirit, and as you charge cry, “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”"

  - os: "Alarum, and chambers go off Exeunt"
    ms: "They all exit to the sounds of battle and gunfire from offstage."
