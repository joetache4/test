<p>Look here upon this picture and on this,</p>
<p>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.</p>
<p>See, what a grace was seated on this brow?</p>
<p>Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,</p>
<p>An eye like Mars to threaten and command,</p>
<p>A station like the herald Mercury</p>
<p>New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill—</p>
<p>A combination and a form indeed</p>
<p>Where every god did seem to set his seal</p>
<p>To give the world assurance of a man.</p>
<p>This was your husband. Look you now, what follows.</p>
<p>Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear</p>
<p>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</p>
<p>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed</p>
<p>And batten on this moor? Ha, have you eyes?</p>
<p>You cannot call it love, for at your age</p>
<p>The heyday in the blood is tame, it’s humble,</p>
<p>And waits upon the judgment. And what judgment</p>
<p>Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,</p>
<p>Else could you not have motion. But sure that sense</p>
<p>Is apoplexed, for madness would not err,</p>
<p>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne’er so thralled,</p>
<p>But it reserved some quantity of choice</p>
<p>To serve in such a difference. What devil was ’t</p>
<p>That thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind?</p>
<p>Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,</p>
<p>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,</p>
<p>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</p>
<p>Could not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?</p>
<p>Rebellious hell,</p>
<p>If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,</p>
<p>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax</p>
<p>And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame</p>
<p>When the compulsive ardor gives the charge,</p>
<p>Since frost itself as actively doth burn,</p>
<p>And reason panders will.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>HAMLET</b>
<p>Look at this picture here, and that one there, the painted images of two brothers. Look how kind and gentlemanly this one is, with his curly hair and his forehead like a Greek god. His eye could command like the god of war. His body is as agile as Mercury just landing on a high hill. A figure and a combination of good qualities that seemed like every god had set his stamp on this man. That was your husband. Now look at this other one. Here is your present husband, like a mildewed ear of corn infecting the healthy one next to it. Do you have eyes? How could you leave the lofty heights of this man here and descend as low as this one? Ha! Do you have eyes? You cannot say you did it out of love, since at your age romantic passions have grown weak, and the heart obeys reason. But what reason could move you from this one to that one? You must have some sense in your head, since you’re able to get around, but it seems to be paralyzed, since even if you were crazy you would know the difference between these two men. No one ever went so insane that they couldn’t get an easy choice like this one right. What devil was it that blindfolded you? Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, ears without hands or eyes, smell without anything else, the use of even one impaired sense would not permit such a mistake as yours. Oh, for shame, why aren’t you blushing? If evil can overtake even an old mother’s bones, then let it melt my own. It turns out it’s no longer shameful to act on impulse—now that the old are doing so, and now that reason is a servant to desire.</p>

<p>And live the purer with the other half.</p>
<p>Good night—but go not to mine uncle’s bed.</p>
<p>Assume a virtue if you have it not.</p>
<p>That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,</p>
<p>Of habits devil, is angel yet in this:</p>
<p>That to the use of actions fair and good</p>
<p>He likewise gives a frock or livery</p>
<p>That aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,</p>
<p>And that shall lend a kind of easiness</p>
<p>To the next abstinence, the next more easy.</p>
<p>For use almost can change the stamp of nature,</p>
<p>And either rein the devil or throw him out</p>
<p>With wondrous potency. Once more, good night,</p>
<p>And when you are desirous to be blessed,</p>
<p>I’ll blessing beg of you. <em>(points to POLONIUS)</em></p>
<p>For this same lord,</p>
<p>I do repent. But heaven hath pleased it so,</p>
<p>To punish me with this and this with me,</p>
<p>That I must be their scourge and minister.</p>
<p>I will bestow him and will answer well</p>
<p>The death I gave him. So, again, good night.</p>
<p>I must be cruel only to be kind.</p>
<p>Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.</p>
<p>One word more, good lady—</p>

<p>Then throw away the worse half, and live a purer life with the other! Good night to you. But don’t go to my uncle’s bed tonight. At least pretend to be virtuous, even if you’re not. Habit is a terrible thing, in that it’s easy to get used to doing evil without feeling bad about it. But it’s also a good thing, in that being good can also become a habit. Say no to sex tonight, and that will make it easier to say no the next time, and still easier the time after that. Habit can change even one’s natural instincts, and either rein in the devil in us, or kick him out. Once again, good night to you, and when you want to repent, I’ll ask you for your blessing too. I’m sorry about what happened to this gentleman <em>(pointing to POLONIUS)</em>, but God wanted to punish me with this murder, and this man with me, so I’m both Heaven’s executioner and its minister of justice. This is bad, but it’ll get worse soon. Oh, and one other thing, madam.</p>

<p>Not this, by no means, that I bid you do—</p>

<p>Whatever you do, don’t do this: let the fat king seduce you into his bed again, so he can pinch your cheek, call you his bunny, and with filthy kisses and a massage of your neck with his damned fingers, make you admit that my madness is fake, all calculated. What a great idea that would be, because why would a fair, sober, wise queen hide such things from a toad, a pig, a monster like him? Who would do that? No, no, it’s <em>much, much</em> better to spill the beans right away, let the cat out of the bag, and break your neck in the process.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s a done deal, the documents are ready, and my two schoolmates, whom I trust about as much as rattlesnakes, are in charge. They’re the ones who’ll lead me on my march to mischief. Let it happen. It’s fun to watch the engineer get blown up by his own explosives, and with any luck I’ll dig a few feet below their bombs and blow them to the moon. Oh, it’s nice to kill two birds with one stone. <em>(points to</em> POLONIUS)* Now that I’ve killed this guy, I’ll be off in a hurry. I’ll lug his guts into the next room. Mother, have a good night. This politician who was in life a babbling idiot is now quiet and serious. Come on, sir, let’s get to the end of our business. Good night, mother.</p>
