<b>LORENZO</b>
<p>Madam, although I speak it in your presence,</p>
<p>You have a noble and a true conceit</p>
<p>Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly</p>
<p>In bearing thus the absence of your lord.</p>
<p>But if you knew to whom you show this honor,</p>
<p>How true a gentleman you send relief,</p>
<p>How dear a lover of my lord your husband,</p>
<p>I know you would be prouder of the work</p>
<p>Than customary bounty can enforce you.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>LORENZO</b>
<p>Madam, I hope you don’t mind my saying that I admire your noble respect for friendship, which you show in letting your husband go off to help his friend like this. If you only knew the man you’re helping out, and what a faithful gentleman he is and how much he loves your husband, I know you’d be even prouder of your kindness than you normally might be.</p>

<b>PORTIA</b>
<p>I never did repent for doing good,</p>
<p>Nor shall not now; for in companions</p>
<p>That do converse and waste the time together</p>
<p>Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,</p>
<p>There must be needs a like proportion</p>
<p>Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit,</p>
<p>Which makes me think that this Antonio,</p>
<p>Being the bosom lover of my lord,</p>
<p>Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,</p>
<p>How little is the cost I have bestowed</p>
<p>In purchasing the semblance of my soul</p>
<p>From out the state of hellish cruelty!</p>
<p>This comes too near the praising of myself.</p>
<p>Therefore no more of it. Hear other things.</p>
<p>Lorenzo, I commit into your hands</p>
<p>The husbandry and manage of my house</p>
<p>Until my lord’s return.</p>
<p>For mine own part,</p>
<p>I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow</p>
<p>To live in prayer and contemplation,</p>
<p>Only attended by Nerissa here</p>
<p>Until her husband and my lord’s return.</p>
<p>There is a monastery two miles off,</p>
<p>And there will we abide. I do desire you</p>
<p>Not to deny this imposition,</p>
<p>The which my love and some necessity</p>
<p>Now lays upon you.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>PORTIA</b>
<p>I’ve never regretted doing good, and I don’t now. Friends who spend a lot of time together and really care equally for each other must have many traits in common. Since Antonio’s my husband’s best friend, they must be very similar men. In that case, the money I’ve sent is a small price to pay to rescue someone who resembles my Bassanio, who’s like my own soul.—Anyway, let’s change the subject, since I feel like I’m starting to flatter myself. I have a favor to ask of you. Lorenzo, please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back. I’ve sworn to God that I’ll live a life of prayer and contemplation until my husband returns. Only Nerissa will keep me company. There’s a monastery two miles away where we can stay. Please say you’ll agree, because I really need you to do this.</p>

<p>They will, Nerissa, but we’ll be disguised as men. I’ll bet you anything that I’ll be handsomer than you when we’re both dressed up. I’ll wear my sword more gracefully, and speak like a teenage boy, and walk with a manly stride rather than my ladylike steps. I’ll talk about fights like a bragging youth, and I’ll tell cute lies about honorable ladies who fell in love with me and got sick and died when I rejected them. They just died, what could I do! Then I’ll start feeling sorry for them, wishing I hadn’t killed them. I’ll tell twenty lies like that, so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago. I know a thousand immature tricks like that, and I’ll use them all.</p>
