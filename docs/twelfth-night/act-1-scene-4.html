<p>My boy, it’s true. Anyone who says you’re a man must not notice how young you are. Your lips are as smooth and red as the goddess Diana’s. Your soft voice is like a young girl’s, high and clear, and the rest of you is pretty feminine too. I know you’re the right person for this job. <em>(to CURIO and attendants)</em> Four or five of you go along with him, or you can all go if you like. I’m most comfortable when I’m alone. <em>(to VIOLA)</em> If you succeed at this assignment, I’ll reward you well. My whole fortune will be yours.</p>
