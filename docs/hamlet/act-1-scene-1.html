<b>HORATIO</b>
<p>That can I.</p>
<p>At least, the whisper goes so: our last king,</p>
<p>Whose image even but now appeared to us,</p>
<p>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</p>
<p>Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,</p>
<p>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet</p>
<p>(For so this side of our known world esteemed him)</p>
<p>Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact</p>
<p>Well ratified by law and heraldry,</p>
<p>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</p>
<p>Which he stood seized of to the conqueror,</p>
<p>Against the which a moiety competent</p>
<p>Was gagèd by our king, which had returned</p>
<p>To the inheritance of Fortinbras</p>
<p>Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same covenant</p>
<p>And carriage of the article designed,</p>
<p>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</p>
<p>Of unimprovèd mettle hot and full,</p>
<p>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</p>
<p>Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes,</p>
<p>For food and diet, to some enterprise</p>
<p>That hath a stomach in ’t, which is no other—</p>
<p>As it doth well appear unto our state—</p>
<p>But to recover of us, by strong hand</p>
<p>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</p>
<p>So by his father lost. And this, I take it,</p>
<p>Is the main motive of our preparations,</p>
<p>The source of this our watch, and the chief head</p>
<p>Of this posthaste and rummage in the land.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>HORATIO</b>
<p>I can. Or at least I can describe the rumors. As you know, our late king, whom we just now saw as a ghost, was the great rival of Fortinbras, king of Norway. Fortinbras dared him to battle. In that fight, our courageous Hamlet (or at least that’s how we thought of him) killed old King Fortinbras, who—on the basis of a valid legal document—surrendered all his territories, along with his life, to his conqueror. If our king had lost, he would have had to do the same. But now old Fortinbras’ young son, also called Fortinbras—he is bold, but unproven—has gathered a bunch of thugs from the lawless outskirts of the country. For some food, they’re eager to take on the tough enterprise of securing the lands the elder Fortinbras lost. As far as I understand, that’s why we’re posted here tonight and why there’s such a commotion in Denmark lately.</p>

<p>A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.</p>
<p>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</p>
<p>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</p>
<p>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</p>

<p>Disasters in the sun, and the moist star</p>
<p>Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands</p>

<b>HORATIO</b>
<p>The ghost is definitely something to worry about. In the high and mighty Roman Empire, just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated, corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish. There were shooting stars, and blood mixed in with the morning dew, and threatening signs on the face of the sun. The moon, which controls the tides of the sea, was so eclipsed it almost went completely out. And we’ve had similar omens of terrible things to come, as if heaven and earth have joined together to warn us what’s going to happen.</p>

<b>HORATIO</b>
<p>And then it acted startled, like a guilty person caught by the law. I’ve heard that the rooster awakens the god of day with its trumpetlike crowing, and makes all wandering ghosts, wherever they are, hurry back to their hiding places. We’ve just seen proof of that.</p>

<p>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</p>
<p>Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes</p>
<p>Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,</p>
<p>The bird of dawning singeth all night long.</p>
<p>And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad.</p>
<p>The nights are wholesome. Then no planets strike,</p>
<p>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</p>
<p>So hallowed and so gracious is that time.</p>

<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<p>Yes, it faded away when the rooster crowed. Some people say that just before Christmas the rooster crows all night long, so that no ghost dares go wandering, and the night is safe. The planets have no sway over us, fairies’ spells don’t work, and witches can’t bewitch us. That’s how holy that night is.</p>

<b>HORATIO</b>
<p>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</p>
<p>But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,</p>
<p>Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.</p>
<p>Break we our watch up, and by my advice,</p>
<p>Let us impart what we have seen tonight</p>
<p>Unto young Hamlet, for, upon my life,</p>
<p>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</p>
<p>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</p>
<p>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</p>

<td class="right secondary">
<b>HORATIO</b>
<p>Yes, I’ve heard the same thing and sort of believe it. But look, morning is breaking beyond that hill in the east, turning the sky red. Let’s interrupt our watch and go tell young Hamlet what we’ve seen tonight. I’m sure this ghost that’s so silent with us will speak to him. Don’t you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this, out of duty and love?</p>
