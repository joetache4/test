<p>O heavy deed!</p>
<p>It had been so with us, had we been there.</p>

<p>To you yourself, to us, to everyone.</p>
<p>Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?</p>
<p>It will be laid to us, whose providence</p>
<p>Should have kept short, restrained and out of haunt,</p>
<p>This mad young man. But so much was our love,</p>
<p>We would not understand what was most fit,</p>
<p>But, like the owner of a foul disease,</p>
<p>To keep it from divulging, let it feed</p>
<p>Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?</p>

<b>CLAUDIUS</b>
<p>Oh, this is terrible! It would’ve happened to me if I’d been there. His wildness is a threat to all of us—to you, to me, to everyone. How will we deal with this violent deed? I’m the one who will be blamed for not restraining and confining this mad young man. But I loved him so much I didn’t want to think about what I had to do. So, like someone suffering from a nasty disease who refuses to divulge his condition and lets it infect him to the core, I kept Hamlet’s condition secret and let it grow more and more dangerous. Where has he gone?</p>
