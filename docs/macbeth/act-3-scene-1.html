<p>Now you have it all: you’re the king, the thane of Cawdor, and the thane of Glamis, just like the weird women promised you. And I suspect you cheated to win these titles. But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants, and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead. If the witches tell the truth—which they did about you—maybe what they said about me will come true too. But shhh! I’ll shut up now.</p>

<p>To be thus is nothing,</p>
<p>But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo</p>
<p>Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature</p>

<p>And to that dauntless temper of his mind</p>
<p>He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor</p>
<p>To act in safety. There is none but he</p>
<p>Whose being I do fear, and under him</p>
<p>My genius is rebuked, as it is said</p>
<p>Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters</p>
<p>When first they put the name of king upon me</p>
<p>And bade them speak to him. Then, prophetlike,</p>
<p>They hailed him father to a line of kings.</p>
<p>Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown</p>
<p>And put a barren scepter in my grip,</p>
<p>Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,</p>
<p>No son of mine succeeding. If ’t be so,</p>
<p>For Banquo’s issue have I filed my mind;</p>
<p>For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered;</p>
<p>Put rancors in the vessel of my peace</p>
<p>Only for them; and mine eternal jewel</p>
<p>Given to the common enemy of man,</p>
<p>To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!</p>

<p>And champion me to th’ utterance. Who’s there?</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<p>To be the king is nothing if I’m not safe as the king. I’m very afraid of Banquo. There’s something noble about him that makes me fear him. He’s willing to take risks, and his mind never stops working. He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely. I’m not afraid of anyone but him. Around him, my guardian angel is frightened, just as Mark Antony’s angel supposedly feared Octavius Caesar. Banquo chided the witches when they first called me king, asking them to tell him his own future. Then, like prophets, they named him the father to a line of kings. They gave me a crown and a scepter that I can’t pass on. Someone outside my family will take these things away from me, since no son of mine will take my place as king. If this is true, then I’ve tortured my conscience and murdered the gracious Duncan for Banquo’s sons. I’ve ruined my own peace for their benefit. I’ve handed over my everlasting soul to the devil so that they could be kings. Banquo’s sons, kings! Instead of watching that happen, I will challenge fate to battle and fight to the death. Who’s there!</p>

<b>MACBETH</b>
<p>Yes, you’re part of the species called men. Just as hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, mutts, shaggy lapdogs, swimming dogs, and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs. But if you list the different kinds of dogs according to their qualities, you can distinguish which breeds are fast or slow, which ones are clever, which ones are watchdogs, and which ones hunters. You can classify each dog according to the natural gifts that separate it from all other dogs. It’s the same with men. Now, if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn’t down at the very bottom, tell me. Because if that’s the case, I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me. As long as Banquo lives, I am sick. I’ll be healthy when he is dead.</p>
