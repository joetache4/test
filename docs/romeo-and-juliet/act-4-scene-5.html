<p>Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion’s cure lives not</p>
<p>In these confusions. Heaven and yourself</p>
<p>Had part in this fair maid. Now heaven hath all,</p>
<p>And all the better is it for the maid.</p>
<p>Your part in her you could not keep from death,</p>
<p>But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.</p>
<p>The most you sought was her promotion,</p>
<p>For ’twas your heaven she should be advanced.</p>
<p>And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced</p>
<p>Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?</p>
<p>Oh, in this love, you love your child so ill</p>
<p>That you run mad, seeing that she is well.</p>
<p>She’s not well married that lives married long,</p>
<p>But she’s best married that dies married young.</p>
<p>Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary</p>
<p>On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,</p>
<p>And in her best array, bear her to church.</p>
<p>For though some nature bids us all lament,</p>
<p>Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.</p>

<b>FRIAR LAWRENCE</b>
<p>Be quiet, for shame! The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming. You had this child with the help of heaven. Now heaven has her. She is in a better place. You could not prevent her from dying someday, but heaven will give her eternal life. The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder—that was your idea of heaven. And now you cry, even though she has risen up above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? Oh, in this love, you love your child so badly, that you go mad, even though she is in heaven. It is best to marry well and die young, better than to be married for a long time. Dry up your tears, and put your rosemary on this beautiful corpse. And, in accordance with custom, carry her to the church in her best clothes. It’s natural for us to shed tears for her, but the truth is, we should be happy for her.</p>
