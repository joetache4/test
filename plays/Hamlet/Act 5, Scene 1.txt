  - os: "Enter a GRAVEDIGGER and the OTHER gravedigger"
    ms: "A GRAVEDIGGER and the OTHER gravedigger enter."

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation?"
    m:
      - "Are they really going to give her a Christian burial after she killed herself?"

  - sp: OTHER
    o:
      - "I tell thee she is. Therefore make her grave straight. The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial."
    m:
      - "I’m telling you, yes. So finish that grave right away. The coroner examined her case and says it should be a Christian funeral."

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defense?"
    m:
      - "But how, unless she drowned in self-defense?"

  - sp: OTHER
    o:
      - "Why, ’tis found so."
    m:
      - "That’s what they’re saying she did."

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "It must be *se offendendo*. It cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act. And an act hath three branches—it is to act, to do, to perform. Argal, she drowned herself wittingly."
    m:
      - "Sounds more like “self-offense,” if you ask me. What I’m saying is, if she knew she was drowning herself, then that’s an act. An act has three sides to it: to do, to act, and to perform. Therefore she must have known she was drowning herself."

  - sp: OTHER
    o:
      - "Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver—"
    m:
      - "No, listen here, gravedigger sir—"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Give me leave. Here lies the water. Good. Here stands the man. Good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he nill he, he goes. Mark you that. But if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life."
    m:
      - "Let me finish. Here’s the water, right? And here’s a man, okay? If the man goes into the water and drowns himself, he’s the one doing it, like it or not. But if the water comes to him and drowns him, then he doesn’t drown himself. Therefore, he who is innocent of his own death does not shorten his own life."

  - sp: OTHER
    o:
      - "But is this law?"
    m:
      - "Is that how the law sees it?"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Ay, marry, is ’t. Crowner’s quest law."
    m:
      - "It sure is. The coroner’s inquest law."

  - sp: OTHER
    o:
      - "Will you ha’ the truth on ’t? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’ Christian burial."
    m:
      - "Do you want to know the truth? If this woman hadn’t been rich, she wouldn’t have been given a Christian burial."

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Why, there thou sayst. And the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They hold up Adam’s profession."
    m:
      - "Well there, now you’ve said it. It’s a pity that the rich have more freedom to hang or drown themselves than the rest of us Christians. Come on, shovel. The most ancient aristocrats in the world are gardeners, ditch-diggers, and gravediggers. They keep up Adam’s profession."

  - sp: OTHER
    o:
      - "Was he a gentleman?"
    m:
      - "Was he an aristocrat? With a coat of arms?"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "He was the first that ever bore arms."
    m:
      - "He was the first person who ever had arms."

  - sp: OTHER
    o:
      - "Why, he had none."
    m:
      - "He didn’t have any."

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says Adam digged. Could he dig without arms? I’ll put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself—"
    m:
      - "What, aren’t you a Christian? The Bible says Adam dug in the ground. How could he dig without arms? I’ll ask you another question. If you can’t answer it—"

  - sp: OTHER
    o:
      - "Go to."
    m:
      - "Go ahead!"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?"
    m:
      - "What do you call a person who builds stronger things than a stonemason, a shipbuilder, or a carpenter does?"

  - sp: OTHER
    o:
      - "The gallows-maker, for that frame outlives a thousand tenants."
    m:
      - "The one who builds the gallows to hang people on, since his structure outlives a thousand inhabitants."

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well, but how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To ’t again, come."
    m:
      - "You’re funny, and I like that. The gallows do a good job. But how? It does a good job for those who do bad. Now, it’s wrong to say that the gallows are stronger than a church. Therefore, the gallows may do *you* some good. Come on, your turn."

  - sp: OTHER
    o:
      - "“Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?”"
    m:
      - "Let’s see, “Who builds stronger things than a stonemason, a shipbuilder, or a carpenter?”"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Ay, tell me that, and unyoke."
    m:
      - "That’s the question, so answer it."

  - sp: OTHER
    o:
      - "Marry, now I can tell."
    m:
      - "Ah, I’ve got it!"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "To ’t."
    m:
      - "Go ahead."

  - sp: OTHER
    o:
      - "Mass, I cannot tell."
    m:
      - "Damn, I forgot."

  - os: "Enter HAMLET and HORATIO afar off"
    ms: "HAMLET and HORATIO enter in the distance."

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating. And when you are asked this question next, say “A grave-maker.” The houses that he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee in. Fetch me a stoup of liquor."
    m:
      - "Don’t beat your brains out over it. You can’t make a slow donkey run by beating it. The next time someone asks you this riddle, say “a gravedigger.” The houses he makes last till Judgment Day. Now go and get me some booze."

    o:

    m:

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:

    o:
      - "That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once. How the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder! It might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o’erreaches, one that would circumvent God, might it not?"
    m:
      - "That skull had a tongue in it once and could sing. That jackass is throwing it around as if it belonged to Cain, who did the first murder! It might be the skull of a politician once capable of talking his way around God, right? And now this idiot is pulling rank on him."

  - sp: HORATIO
    o:
      - "It might, my lord."
    m:
      - "Indeed, my lord."

    o:
      - "Or of a courtier, which could say, “Good morrow, sweet lord!” “How dost thou, good lord?” This might be my Lord Such-a-one that praised my Lord Such-a-one’s horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?"
    m:
      - "Or a courtier, who could say things like, “Good night, my sweet lord! How are you doing, good lord?” This might be the skull of Lord So-and-So, who praised Lord Such-and-Such’s horse when he wanted to borrow it, right?"

    o:
      - "Why, e’en so. And now my Lady Worm’s, chapless and knocked about the mazard with a sexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, an we had the trick to see ’t. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with them? Mine ache to think on ’t."
    m:
      - "Exactly. And now it’s the property of Lady Worm, its lower jaw knocked off and thwacked on the noggin with a shovel. That’s quite a reversal of fortune, isn’t it, if we could only see it? Are these bones worth nothing more than bowling pins now? It makes my bones ache to think about it."

    o:
      - "There’s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillities, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in ’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box, and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?"
    m:
      - "There’s another. Could that be a lawyer’s skull? Where’s all his razzle-dazzle legal jargon now? Why does he allow this idiot to knock him on the head with a dirty shovel, instead of suing him for assault and battery? Maybe this guy was once a great landowner, with his deeds and contracts, his tax shelters and his annuities. Is it part of his deed of ownership to have his skull filled up with dirt? Does he only get to keep as much land as a set of contracts would cover if you spread them out on the ground? The deeds to his properties would barely fit in this coffin—and the coffin’s all the property he gets to keep?"

      - "Ay, my lord, and of calfskins too."
    m:
      - "Yes, my lord, and calfskin too."

    o:
      - "They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that."
      - "I will speak to this fellow.—Whose grave’s this, sirrah?"
    m:

    m:
      - "I think it really must be yours, since you’re the one lying in it."

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "You lie out on ’t, sir, and therefore it is not yours. For my part, I do not lie in ’t, and yet it is mine."
    m:
      - "And you’re lying outside of it, so it’s not yours. As for me, I’m not lying to you in it—it’s really mine."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Thou dost lie in ’t, to be in ’t and say it is thine. ’Tis for the dead, not for the quick. Therefore thou liest."
    m:
      - "But you *are* lying in it, being in it and saying it’s yours. It’s for the dead, not the living. So you’re lying."

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "’Tis a quick lie, sir. ’Twill away gain from me to you."
    m:
      - "That’s a lively lie, sir—it jumps so fast from me to you."

    o:

      - "One that was a woman, sir, but, rest her soul, she’s dead."
    m:
      - "One who used to be a woman but—bless her soul—is dead now."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of it. The age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been a grave-maker?"
    m:
      - "How literal this guy is! We have to speak precisely, or he’ll get the better of us with his wordplay. Lord, Horatio, I’ve been noticing this for a few years now. The peasants have become so clever and witty that they’re nipping at the heels of noblemen.—How long have you been a gravedigger?"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Of all the days i’ the year, I came to ’t that day that our last"
      - "King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras."
    m:

    m:
      - "How long ago was that?"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the very day that young Hamlet was born, he that is mad and sent into England."
    m:
      - "You don’t know that? Any fool could tell you, it was the day that young Hamlet was born—the one who went crazy and got sent off to England."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?"
    m:
      - "Why was he sent to England?"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Why, because he was mad. He shall recover his wits there, or, if he do not, it’s no great matter there."
    m:
      - "Because he was crazy. He’ll recover his sanity there. Or if he doesn’t, it won’t matter in England."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Why?"
    m:
      - "Why not?"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "’Twill not be seen in him there. There the men are as mad as he."
    m:
      - "Because nobody will notice he’s crazy. Everyone there is as crazy as he is."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "How came he mad?"
    m:
      - "How did he go crazy?"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Very strangely, they say."
    m:
      - "In a strange way, they say."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "How “strangely”?"
    m:
      - "What do you mean, “in a strange way”?"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Faith, e’en with losing his wits."
    m:
      - "By losing his mind."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Upon what ground?"
    m:
      - "On what grounds?"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years."
    m:
      - "Right here in Denmark. I’ve been the church warden here for thirty years, since childhood."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "How long will a man lie i’ the earth ere he rot?"
    m:
      - "How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot?"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Faith, if he be not rotten before he die—as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in— he will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine year."
    m:
      - "Well, if he’s not rotten before he dies (and there are a lot of people now who are so rotten they start falling to pieces even before you put them in the coffin), he’ll last eight or nine years. A leathermaker will last nine years."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Why he more than another?"
    m:
      - "Why does he last longer?"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while, and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. *(indicates a skull)* Here’s a skull now. This skull has lain in the earth three-and-twenty years."
    m:
      - "Because his hide is so leathery from his trade that he keeps the water off him a long time, and water is what makes your goddamn body rot more than anything. Here’s a skull that’s been here twenty-three years."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Whose was it?"
    m:
      - "Whose was it?"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "A whoreson mad fellow’s it was. Whose do you think it was?"
    m:
      - "A crazy bastard. Who do you think?"

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Nay, I know not."
    m:
      - "I really don’t know."

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER
    o:
      - "A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! He poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick’s skull, the king’s jester."
    m:
      - "Damn that crazy madman! He poured a pitcher of white wine on my head once. This is the skull of Yorick, the king’s jester."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "This?"
    m:
      - "This one?"

  - sp: GRAVEDIGGER

    m:
      - "Yes, that one."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:
      - "Let me see. *(takes the skull)* Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back a thousand times, and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. —Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs? Your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now to mock your own grinning? Quite chapfallen? Now get you to my lady’s chamber and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favor she must come. Make her laugh at that.—Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing."
    m:
      - "Let me see. *(he takes the skull)* Oh, poor Yorick! I used to know him, Horatio—a very funny guy, and with an excellent imagination. He carried me on his back a thousand times, and now—how terrible—this is him. It makes my stomach turn. I don’t know how many times I kissed the lips that used to be right here. Where are your jokes now? Your pranks? Your songs? Your flashes of wit that used to set the whole table laughing? You don’t make anybody smile now. Are you sad about that? You need to go to my lady’s room and tell her that no matter how much makeup she slathers on, she’ll end up just like you some day. That’ll make her laugh. Horatio, tell me something."

  - sp: HORATIO
    o:
      - "E’en so."
    m:
      - "Exactly like that."

  - sp: HAMLET
    o:

    o:
      - "To what base uses we may return, Horatio. Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?"
    m:

So why can’t someone plug a beer barrel with the dirt that used to be Alexander? The great emperor Caesar, dead and turned to clay, might plug up a hole to keep the wind away. Oh, to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall! But quiet, be quiet a minute."
