      - "Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye"
      - "And all my soul, and all my every part;"
      - "And for this sin there is no remedy,"
      - "It is so grounded inward in my heart."
      - "Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,"
      - "No shape so true, no truth of such account;"
      - "And for myself mine own worth do define,"
      - "As I all other in all worths surmount."
      - "But when my glass shows me myself indeed,"
      - "Beated and chopped with tanned antiquity,"
      - "Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;"
      - "Self so self-loving were iniquity."
      - "  ’Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,"
      - "  Painting my age with beauty of thy days."
    m:
      - "The sin of self-love controls everything I see, and my entire soul, and every part of me. There’s no way to get rid of this sin, it’s so deeply rooted in my heart. I think that no one’s face is as gracious as mine, no body so evenly proportioned, no one’s integrity of such high worth. I calculate my value such that I surpass everybody else in everything. But when my mirror shows me how I really look, beaten and cracked by age and the sun, I come to an opposite conclusion: For myself to love myself so much would be a sinful error. It’s you I’m praising when I praise myself, ornamenting my old age with the beauty of your youth."
