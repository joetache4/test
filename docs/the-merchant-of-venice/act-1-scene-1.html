<p>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.</p>
<p>It wearies me; you say it wearies you.</p>
<p>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</p>
<p>What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,</p>

<p>To be honest, I don’t know why I’m so sad. I’m tired of it, and you say you’re tired of it too. But I have no idea how I got so depressed. And if I can’t figure out what’s making me depressed, I must not understand myself very well.</p>

<p>Your mind is tossing on the ocean,</p>

<p>Like signors and rich burghers on the flood—</p>

<p>Do overpeer the petty traffickers</p>

<p>You’re worried about your ships. Your mind is out there getting tossed around on the ocean with them. But they’re fine. They’re like huge parade floats on the sea.

<p>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</p>
<p>The better part of my affections would</p>
<p>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</p>

<p>Yes, believe me, if I had such risky business ventures in other countries, I’d be sad too. I’d worry about it every second. I’d constantly be tossing blades of grass into the air to find out which way the wind was blowing. I’d be peering over maps to figure out the best ports, piers, and waterways. Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad.</p>

<p>My wind cooling my broth</p>
<p>Would blow me to an ague when I thought</p>
<p>What harm a wind too great at sea might do.</p>
<p>I should not see the sandy hourglass run,</p>
<p>But I should think of shallows and of flats</p>
<p>And see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand,</p>
<p>Vailing her high top lower than her ribs</p>
<p>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</p>
<p>And see the holy edifice of stone</p>
<p>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</p>
<p>Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,</p>
<p>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</p>
<p>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</p>
<p>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</p>
<p>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</p>
<p>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</p>
<p>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?</p>
<p>But tell not me. I know Antonio</p>
<p>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>SALARINO</b>
<p>I’d get scared every time I blew on my soup to cool it, thinking of how a strong wind could wipe out my ships. Every time I glanced at the sand in an hourglass I’d imagine my ships wrecked on sandbars. I’d think of dangerous rocks every time I went to church and saw the stones it was made of. If my ship brushed up against rocks like that, its whole cargo of spices would be dumped into the sea. All of its silk shipments would be sent flying into the roaring waters. In one moment I’d go bankrupt. Who wouldn’t get sad thinking about things like that? It’s obvious. Antonio is sad because he’s so worried about his cargo.</p>

<p>Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it—</p>
<p>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</p>
<p>Nor to one place, nor is my whole estate</p>
<p>Upon the fortune of this present year.</p>
<p>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</p>
</td>
<td class="right secondary">
<b>ANTONIO</b>
<p>No, that’s not it, trust me. Thankfully my financial situation is healthy. I don’t have all of my money invested in one ship, or one part of the world. If I don’t do well this year, I’ll still be okay. So it’s not my business that’s making me sad.</p>

<p>You’re not in love either? Fine, let’s just say you’re sad because you’re not in a good mood. You know, it’d be just as easy for you to laugh and dance around and say you’re in a good mood. You could just say you’re not sad. Humans are so different. Some people will laugh at anything, and others are so grouchy they won’t even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny.</p>

<p>Let me play the fool.</p>

<p>Why should a man whose blood is warm within</p>

<p>Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice</p>
<p>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio—</p>
<p>I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks—</p>
<p>There are a sort of men whose visages</p>
<p>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</p>
<p>And do a willful stillness entertain</p>
<p>With purpose to be dressed in an opinion</p>
<p>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</p>
<p>As who should say, “I am Sir Oracle,</p>
<p>And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark!”</p>

<p>That therefore only are reputed wise</p>
<p>For saying nothing, when I am very sure</p>
<p>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears</p>
<p>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.</p>

<p>Then I’ll play the happy fool and get laugh lines on my face. I’d rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun. Why should any living man sit still like a statue? Why should he sleep when he’s awake? Why should he get ulcers from being crabby all the time? I love you, and I’m telling you this because I care about you, Antonio—there are men who always look serious. Their faces never move or show any expression, like stagnant ponds covered with scum. They’re silent and stern, and they think they’re wise and deep, important and respectable. When they talk, they think everybody else should keep quiet, and that even dogs should stop barking. I know a lot of men like that, Antonio. The only reason they’re considered wise is because they don’t say anything. I’m sure if they ever opened their mouths, everyone would see what fools they are. I’ll talk to you more about this some other time. In the meantime, cheer up. Don’t go around looking so glum. That’s my opinion, but what do I know? I’m a fool.—Let’s go, Lorenzo.—Goodbye for now. I’ll finish my lecture after dinner.</p>

But if you’d be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first, I’ll watch your arrow more carefully this time.
