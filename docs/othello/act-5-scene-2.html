<p>It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.</p>
<p>Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars,</p>
<p>It is the cause. Yet I’ll not shed her blood,</p>
<p>Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow</p>
<p>And smooth as monumental alabaster.</p>
<p>Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.</p>
<p>Put out the light, and then put out the light.</p>
<p>If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,</p>
<p>I can again thy former light restore</p>
<p>Should I repent me. But once put out thy light,</p>
<p>Thou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature,</p>
<p>I know not where is that Promethean heat</p>
<p>That can thy light relume. When I have plucked thy rose</p>
<p>I cannot give it vital growth again,</p>
<p>It must needs wither. I’ll smell thee on the tree.</p>
<p>Oh, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade</p>
<p>Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.</p>
<p>Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee</p>
<p>And love thee after. <em>(kissing her)</em> One more, and that’s the last.</p>
<p>So sweet was ne’er so fatal. I must weep,</p>
<p>But they are cruel tears. This sorrow’s heavenly,</p>
<p>It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.</p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<p>I have to do it, I have to do it. I have to keep my reason in mind. I won’t say out loud what my reason is, but I have to do it. But I won’t shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin, whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble. But she’s got to die, or she’ll cheat on other men. Put out the light of the candle, and then put out the light of her heart. If I extinguish the candle, I can light it again if I regret it. But once I kill you, you beautiful, fake woman, I do not know the magic that could bring you back. When I’ve plucked this rose, I can’t make it grow again; it will have no choice but to wither and die. Let me smell you while you’re still on the tree. <em>(he kisses her)</em> Oh, that sweet breath almost convinces me not to kill you and carry out justice. One more, one more kiss. If you’re this beautiful when you’re dead, I’ll kill you and then love you afterward. <em>(kissing her)</em> One more, and this is the last. Such a sweet kiss was never so deadly. I have to cry, but I have to be cruel too. I’m acting like God in the Old Testament—I have to punish the one I love. She’s waking up.</p>

You could tap me with a feather and I’d back away. Where would Othello go?—Oh, look at you! Such cruel luck! You’re as pale as your nightgown! When we meet on Judgment Day, that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell, where devils will grab me. You’re cold, cold, and you were never hot with lust. Oh you damned villain! Whip me, you devils, so I don’t have to look at this heavenly sight! Blow on me with hot winds, roast me in lava, drown me in liquid fire! Oh, Desdemona! Dead Desdemona! Oh, oh!</p>

When you record these sad events in your letters, please describe me exactly as I am. Don’t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility. If you’re being fair, you’ll have to describe me as someone who loved too much, but who wasn’t wise about it. I was not easily made jealous, but once I was tricked and manipulated, I worked myself into a frenzy. Describe me as a fool who threw away a precious pearl with his own hands, like a silly Indian who didn’t know what it was worth. As someone who was not emotional, but who then cried a lot. Write all this down, and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian, so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this.</p>
