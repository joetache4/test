<b>MACBETH</b>
<p>If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well</p>
<p>It were done quickly. If the assassination</p>
<p>Could trammel up the consequence, and catch</p>
<p>With his surcease success; that but this blow</p>
<p>Might be the be-all and the end-all here,</p>
<p>But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,</p>
<p>We’d jump the life to come. But in these cases</p>
<p>We still have judgment here, that we but teach</p>
<p>Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return</p>
<p>To plague th’ inventor: this even-handed justice</p>
<p>Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice</p>
<p>To our own lips. He’s here in double trust:</p>
<p>First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,</p>
<p>Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,</p>
<p>Who should against his murderer shut the door,</p>
<p>Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan</p>
<p>Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been</p>
<p>So clear in his great office, that his virtues</p>
<p>Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against</p>
<p>The deep damnation of his taking-off;</p>
<p>And pity, like a naked newborn babe,</p>
<p>Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubim, horsed</p>
<p>Upon the sightless couriers of the air,</p>
<p>Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,</p>
<p>That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur</p>
<p>To prick the sides of my intent, but only</p>
<p>Vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself</p>
<p>And falls on th’ other.</p>

<b>MACBETH</b>
<p>If this business would really be finished when I did the deed, then it would be best to get it over with quickly. If the assassination of the king could work like a net, sweeping up everything and preventing any consequences, then the murder would be the be-all and end-all of the whole affair, and I would gladly put my soul and the afterlife at risk to do it. But for crimes like these there are still punishments in this world. By committing violent crimes we only teach other people to commit violence, and the violence of our students will come back to plague us teachers. Justice, being equal to everyone, forces us to drink from the poisoned cup that we serve to others. The king trusts me in two ways. First of all, I am his kinsman and his subject, so I should always try to protect him. Second, I am his host, so I should be closing the door in his murderer’s face, not trying to murder him myself. Besides, Duncan has been such a humble leader, so free of corruption, that his virtuous legacy will speak for him when he dies, as if angels were playing trumpets against the injustice of his murder. Pity, like an innocent newborn baby, will ride the wind with winged angels on invisible horses through the air to spread news of the horrible deed to everyone everywhere. People will shed a flood of tears that will drown the wind like a horrible downpour of rain. I can’t spur myself to action. The only thing motivating me is ambition, which makes people rush ahead of themselves toward disaster.</p>

<b>LADY MACBETH</b>
<p>If you weren’t a man, then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this? When you dared to do it, that’s when you were a man. And if you go one step further by doing what you dared to do before, you’ll be that much more the man. The time and place weren’t right before, but you would have gone ahead with the murder anyhow. Now the time and place are just right, but they’re almost too good for you. I have suckled a baby, and I know how sweet it is to love the baby at my breast. But even as the baby was smiling up at me, I would have plucked my nipple out of its mouth and smashed its brains out against a wall if I had sworn to do that the same way you have sworn to do this.</p>
