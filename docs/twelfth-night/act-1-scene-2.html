<p>True, madam. And, to comfort you with chance,</p>
<p>Assure yourself, after our ship did split,</p>
<p>When you and those poor number saved with you</p>
<p>Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,</p>
<p>Most provident in peril, bind himself,</p>
<p>Courage and hope both teaching him the practice,</p>
<p>To a strong mast that lived upon the sea,</p>
<p>Where, like Arion on the dolphin’s back,</p>
<p>I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves</p>
<p>So long as I could see.</p>

<b>CAPTAIN</b>
<p>It’s possible, ma’am. Don’t give up yet. When our ship was wrecked and you and a few other survivors were clinging onto our lifeboat, I saw your brother tie himself to a big mast floating in the sea. He was acting resourcefully and courageously in a dangerous situation. For as long as I could see him, he stayed afloat on the waves like Arion on the dolphin’s back.</p>

<p><em>(giving him money)</em> Thank you for saying that—here’s some money to express my gratitude. Since I survived, it’s easier for me to imagine he survived too, and what you say gives me a reason to hope for the best. Do you know this area we’re in?</p>

<p>You seem to be a good person, captain, and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside, I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners. Please—and I’ll pay you plenty for this—help me conceal my identity, and find me the right disguise so I can look the way I want. I want to be this Duke’s servant. You’ll introduce me to him as a eunuch. You won’t be wasting your time, because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music, so he’ll be happy to have me in his service. Only time will tell what will happen after that—just please keep quiet about what I’m trying to do.</p>
