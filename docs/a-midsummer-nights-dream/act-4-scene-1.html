<b>OBERON</b>
<p>Welcome, good Robin. Do you see this sweet sight? Now I’m starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated. I ran into her recently at the edge of the forest, looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot, and I scolded her and argued with her. She had put a wreath of fresh, fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead, and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass. When I had taunted her as much as I wanted to, and she begged me very nicely to leave her alone, I asked her for the stolen Indian child. She said yes right away, and sent a fairy to bring him to my home in Fairyland. And now that I have the boy, I’ll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong. And, gentle Puck, take this transformed ass’ head off of the head of that Athenian man, so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do, they can all go back to Athens. They’ll only remember the events of tonight as a very unpleasant dream. But first I’ll release the fairy queen from the spell.</p>

<p><em>(to THESEUS)</em> Enough, enough, my lord. You’ve heard enough evidence! I insist that the law punish him—They were going to run away, Demetrius, they were running away to defeat us, robbing you of your wife and me of my fatherly right to decide who my son-in-law will be.</p>

<p><em>(to THESEUS)</em> My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,</p>
<p>Of this their purpose hither to this wood.</p>
<p>And I in fury hither followed them,</p>
<p>Fair Helena in fancy following me.</p>
<p>But, my good lord, I wot not by what power—</p>
<p>But by some power it is—my love to Hermia,</p>
<p>Melted as the snow, seems to me now</p>
<p>As the remembrance of an idle gaud</p>
<p>Which in my childhood I did dote upon.</p>
<p>And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,</p>
<p>The object and the pleasure of mine eye,</p>
<p>Is only Helena. To her, my lord,</p>
<p>Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia.</p>
<p>But like in sickness did I loathe this food.</p>
<p>But as in health, come to my natural taste,</p>
<p>Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,</p>
<p>And will for evermore be true to it.</p>

<p><em>(to THESEUS)</em> My lord, the beautiful Helena told me about their secret plan to escape into this forest. I was furious and followed them here, and the lovely Helena was so in love with me that she followed me. I’m not sure how it happened—but somehow, something made my love for Hermia melt away like snow. My past love for Hermia now seems like a memory of some cheap toy I used to love as a child. Now the only person I love, and believe in, and want to look at, is Helena. I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia. Then I hated her for a time, as a sick person hates the food he usually loves. But now I have my natural taste back, like a sick person when he recovers. Now I want Helena, I love her, I long for her, and I will always be true to her.</p>

<p>Fair lovers, you are fortunately met.</p>
<p>Of this discourse we more will hear anon.—</p>
<p>Egeus, I will overbear your will.</p>
<p>For in the temple by and by with us</p>
<p>These couples shall eternally be knit.—</p>
<p>And, for the morning now is something worn,</p>
<p>Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.</p>

<p>We’ll hold a feast in great solemnity.</p>
<p>Come, Hippolyta.</p>

<p>You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here. We’ll talk more about this later.—Egeus, I’m overriding your wishes. These couples will be married along with me and Hippolyta in the temple later today.—And now, since the morning is almost over, we’ll give up on the idea of hunting. Come with us to Athens. We three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast. Come, Hippolyta.</p>

<p><em>(waking)</em> When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is “Most fair Pyramus.” Heigh-ho! Peter Quince? Flute the bellows-mender? Snout the tinker? Starveling? God’s my life, stol’n hence, and left me asleep? I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream—past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and methought I had—but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream. It shall be called “Bottom’s Dream” because it hath no bottom. And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke. Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.</p>

<b>BOTTOM</b>
<p><em>(waking up)</em> Tell me when my cue comes, and I’ll say my line. My next cue is “Most handsome Pyramus.” Hey! Peter Quince? Flute the bellows-repairman? Snout the handyman? Starveling? My God, they’ve all run away and left me sleeping here? What a weird dream I had.—You can’t even describe such a weird dream. You’d be an ass if you even tried to explain it. I thought I was—no, nobody can even describe what I was. I thought I was, I thought I had—but a person would be an idiot to try to say what I thought I had. No eye has ever heard, no ear has ever seen, no hand has tasted, or tongue felt, or heart described what my dream was like. I’ll get Peter Quince to write this dream down as a ballad. I’ll call it “Bottom’s Dream” because it’s so deep that it has no bottom. And I’ll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play. Or maybe, to make it even more lovely, I’ll sing it when the heroine dies.</p>
