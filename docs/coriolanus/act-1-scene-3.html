<p>I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a</p>
<p>more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I</p>
<p>should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he</p>
<p>won honour than in the embracements of his bed where</p>
<p>he would show most love. When yet he was but</p>
<p>tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when</p>
<p>youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when</p>
<p>for a day of kings’ entreaties a mother should not</p>
<p>sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering</p>
<p>how honour would become such a person. that it was</p>
<p>no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if</p>
<p>renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek</p>
<p>danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel</p>
<p>war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows</p>
<p>bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not</p>
<p>more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child</p>
<p>than now in first seeing he had proved himself a</p>
<p>man.</p>

<b>VOLUMNIA</b>
<p>Please, my daughter-in-law, sing or express yourself more cheerfully. If my son were my husband, I would be happier with him away winning honors than lovingly embracing me in bed. Before he was full grown, when he was still my only child, when he was boyishly handsome and attracting much attention, when even if the king begged me I shouldn’t have let him out of my sight for an hour, I considered how honored he would become, and that unless he were inspired to make a name for himself, he would be no better than a picture hanging on the wall, so I happily let him face danger, because that’s how he was likely to find fame. I sent him to a cruel war from which he returned crowned with garlands of oak. I tell you, daughter-in-law, I jumped for joy more to see that he had proven himself as a man than I did when I first heard he was a boy child.</p>
