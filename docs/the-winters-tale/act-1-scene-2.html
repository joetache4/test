Jealousy’s intensity strikes me through to my heart and makes things that are impossible seem possible. That jealousy speaks in dreams. How can this be?

There’s comfort in the fact that other men have had wives and those wives have been unfaithful, as mine has, against their will. If everyone whose wife strayed were to despair, a tenth of mankind would hang themselves. There’s no remedy for it, since it is a world full of lust, from east to west and north and south. There’s no barricade you can build around the womb, and one’s enemy will go in and out as he pleases. Thousands of us have the disease and don’t know it. What now, boy?</p>

<p>Oh, unfortunate lady! What have I gotten into? I have to poison good Polixenes, only because I would obey a master who is mad and wants all his servants to be mad, too. If I do this, I’ll be promoted. But even if I could find one example of someone who had struck down a chosen king and prospered, I wouldn’t do it. Since there isn’t such an example recorded anywhere in history, even a villain wouldn’t do it. I have to leave the court, since whether I do it or not I’m certain to be hanged. Oh, good! Here comes Polixenes.</p>
