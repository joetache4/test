<p>My desolation does begin to make</p>

<p>Not being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave,</p>
<p>A minister of her will. And it is great</p>
<p>To do that thing that ends all other deeds,</p>

<p>Being alone has helped me better understand my life. It’s pathetic to be Caesar. He can’t be Fortune; he’s only Fortune’s errand boy.

<p>Quickly, quickly, good Iras, quickly. I think I hear Antony call me. I see him revive himself to praise my noble act. I hear him mock Caesar’s luck, which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath. Husband, I’m coming! Now let my courage prove my title as wife. I am now made of fire and air, and I leave the other elements, earth and water, to this mortal life. So, are you done? Come then, kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips. Good-bye, kind Charmian. Iras, I won’t see you again for a long time.</p>
