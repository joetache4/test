  - os: "Enter LEONATO,ANTONIO, HERO,BEATRICE, URSULA andMARGARET"
    ms: "LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, URSULA, and MARGARET enter."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "Was not Count John here at supper?"
    m:
      - "Wasn’t Don John at dinner tonight?"

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "I saw him not."
    m:
      - "I didn’t see him."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I"
      - "am heartburned an hour after."
    m:
      - "That man always looks so sour! Just looking at him gives me heartburn."

  - sp: HERO
    o:
      - "He is of a very melancholy disposition."
    m:
      - "He has a very gloomy attitude."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "He were an excellent man that were made just in the"
      - "midway between him and Benedick. The one is too like an"
      - "image and says nothing, and the other too like my lady’s"
      - "eldest son, evermore tattling."
    m:
      - "It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick. One of them is too much like a painting of a man—he never speaks—and the other is too much like a spoiled little boy, always chattering."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "Then half Signor Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s"
      - "mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in Signor"
      - "Benedick’s face—"
    m:
      - "So, the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John—"

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough"
      - "in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the"
      - "world, if he could get her goodwill."
    m:
      - "And if he were handsome, agile, and rich, too, he could have any woman in the world—all he’d need was her good will."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband if"
      - "thou be so shrewd of thy tongue."
    m:
      - "Really, niece, you’ll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "In faith, she’s too curst."
    m:
      - "Honestly, she is too ill-tempered."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen God’s sending"
      - "that way, for it is said, “God sends a curst cow short horns,”"
      - "but to a cow too curst, he sends none."
    m:
      - "Being “too ill-tempered” is different from being simply “ill-tempered,” right? So I suppose that means I can escape God’s punishment, for in the old proverb, it is said that “God gives an ill-tempered cow short horns” so that she can’t inflict damage on anyone. But it doesn’t say anything about a cow that is *too* ill-tempered."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns."
    m:
      - "So then, for being too argumentative, God won’t send you any horns?"

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "Just, if he send me no husband, for the which blessing I am"
      - "at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord, I"
      - "could not endure a husband with a beard on his face! I had"
      - "rather lie in the woolen."
    m:
      - "Exactly. I pray every morning and night that the Lord won’t send me a husband. Really, I couldn’t stand a husband with a beard. I’d rather be wrapped in scratchy blankets all night."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "You may light on a husband that hath no beard."
    m:
      - "Maybe you will find a husband without a beard."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "What should I do with him? Dress him in my apparel and"
      - "make him my waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard"
      - "is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than"
      - "a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me, and"
      - "he that is less than a man, I am not for him. Therefore I will"
      - "even take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd, and lead his"
      - "apes into hell."
    m:
      - "And then what would I do with him? Dress him up in my clothes and pretend he’s my lady servant? If he has a beard, he’s more than a boy; if he doesn’t have a beard, he’s less than a man. If he’s more than a boy, he’s not the one for me, and if he’s less than a man, I’m not the one for him. They say that women who die unmarried are destined to lead the apes to hell, and I suppose that’ll be my fate as well."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "Well then, go you into hell?"
    m:
      - "So you’ll go to hell?"

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "No, but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an"
      - "old cuckold with horns on his head, and say, “Get you to"
      - "heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven; here’s no place for you"
      - "maids.” So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter. For"
      - "the heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there"
      - "live we as merry as the day is long."
    m:
      - "No, just to the gates of hell, where the devil will meet me, with the horns on his head like a cuckold, and say, “Go up to heaven, Beatrice. Hell is no place for you virgins.” So I’ll fly up to heaven (leaving the apes behind) where I’ll be met by Saint Peter guarding heaven’s gates. He will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit, and I’ll have fun there forever."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "*(to HERO)* Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your"
      - "father."
    m:
      - "*(to HERO)* Well, niece, I trust that you will defer to your father on these important decisions."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "Yes, faith, it is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy and say,"
      - "“Father, as it please you.” But yet for all that, cousin, let"
      - "him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy and"
      - "say, “Father, as it please me.”"
    m:
      - "Surely, my cousin has a duty to please her father. But if the husband her father chooses isn’t handsome, she should sweetly tell her father that she will please herself—with another one."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband."
    m:
      - "Well, niece, I hope that I will see you married one day."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "Not till God make men of some other metal than earth."
      - "Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a"
      - "piece of valiant dust? To make an account of her life to a clod"
      - "of wayward marl? No, uncle, I’ll none. Adam’s sons are my"
      - "brethren, and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred."
    m:
      - "No, I won’t take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt. What woman wouldn’t be distressed, being lorded over by a handful of dust? Can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay? No, uncle, I won’t be married. And anyhow, if Adam is the father of all mankind, then his sons are my brothers, and really I believe that incest is a sin."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "*(to HERO)* Daughter, remember what I told you. If the"
      - "Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer."
    m:
      - "*(to HERO)* Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince asks for your hand in marriage, you know what to tell him."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed"
      - "in good time. If the Prince be too important, tell him there"
      - "is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For"
      - "hear me, Hero, wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a"
      - "Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace. The first suit is hot"
      - "and hasty like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the"
      - "wedding, mannerly modest as a measure, full of state and"
      - "ancientry; and then comes repentance, and with his bad"
      - "legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink"
      - "into his grave."
    m:
      - "But cousin, make sure he woos you properly and appropriately. If he is too insistent, tell him that romance is like a dance: it has its own rhythm and timing. Look, the three stages of romance are like three different dances. The wooing is like a Scottish jig: hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion. The wedding is a like a dance you would do before the King: proper and decorous. Finally, you get to the part where you regret having gotten married in the first place. It is like the lively cinquepace: it goes faster and faster until you eventually topple over and die."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly."
    m:
      - "Niece, you are exceptionally perceptive."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "I have a good eye, uncle. I can see a church by daylight."
    m:
      - "I have a good eye, uncle. I can see what’s in broad daylight."

  - sp: LEONATO
    o:
      - "The revelers are entering, brother. Make good room."
    m:
      - "The partygoers have arrived. Let’s give them room."

  - os: "Enter DON PEDRO,CLAUDIO, BENEDICK,BALTHASAR, DON JOHN,BORACHIO, MARGARET,URSULA and others, masked"
    ms: "DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO,BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO,MARGARET, URSULA enter along with other partygoers. They’re all wearing masks."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "Lady, will you walk a bout with your friend?"
    m:
      - "My lady, will you have a dance with me?"

  - os: "They begin to dance"
    ms: "They begin to dance."

  - sp: HERO
    o:
      - "So you walk softly, and look sweetly, and say nothing, I am"
      - "yours for the walk, and especially when I walk away."
    m:
      - "As long as you move gracefully, look handsome, and say nothing, I’m yours for the dance. And I’ll even linger after I’ve gone."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "With me in your company?"
    m:
      - "Will I be with you then?"

  - sp: HERO
    o:
      - "I may say so when I please."
    m:
      - "Perhaps, if I decide to let you."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "And when please you to say so?"
    m:
      - "And when will that be?"

  - sp: HERO
    o:
      - "When I like your favor, for God defend the lute should be"
      - "like the case!"
    m:
      - "When I like the way you look, for God forbid your face be as ugly as your mask!"

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "My visor is Philemon’s roof; within the house is Jove."
    m:
      - "My mask is like the roof of the poor Philemon’s humble cottage; underneath the mask, I am as magnificent as the glorious god Jove."

  - sp: HERO
    o:
      - "Why, then, your visor should be thatched."
    m:
      - "Well, then, since Philemon’s roof was thatched with straw, your mask should have a beard."

  - sp: DON PEDRO
    o:
      - "Speak low if you speak love."
    m:
      - "If you wish to speak of love, speak more softly."

  - os: "They move aside. BALTHASAR andMARGARET move forward"
    ms: "They move aside. BALTHASAR andMARGARET move forward."

  - sp: BALTHASAR
    o:
      - "Well, I would you did like me."
    m:
      - "Well, I wish you liked me."

  - sp: MARGARET
    o:
      - "So would not I for your own sake, for I have many ill qualities."
    m:
      - "I’m glad I don’t, for your sake. I have many awful qualities."

  - sp: BALTHASAR
    o:
      - "Which is one?"
    m:
      - "Tell me one."

  - sp: MARGARET
    o:
      - "I say my prayers aloud."
    m:
      - "I say my prayers out loud."

  - sp: BALTHASAR
    o:
      - "I love you the better; the hearers may cry “Amen.”"
    m:
      - "That makes me love you even more. Everyone who hears you can shout, “Amen.”"

  - sp: MARGARET
    o:
      - "God match me with a good dancer!"
    m:
      - "God give me a good dance partner!"

  - sp: BALTHASAR
    o:
      - "Amen."
    m:
      - "Amen. That would be me."

  - sp: MARGARET
    o:
      - "And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done!"
      - "Answer, clerk."
    m:
      - "And God take him away from me when we’re finished dancing! Go ahead—say “Amen.”"

  - sp: BALTHASAR
    o:
      - "No more words. The clerk is answered."
    m:
      - "No more talking. I’ve got my answer."

  - os: "They move aside. URSULA andANTONIO move forward."
    ms: "They move aside. URSULA andANTONIO move forward."

  - sp: URSULA
    o:
      - "I know you well enough. You are Signor Antonio."
    m:
      - "I know who you are; you are Signior Antonio."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "At a word, I am not."
    m:
      - "No, really, I’m not."

  - sp: URSULA
    o:
      - "I know you by the waggling of your head."
    m:
      - "I can tell by the way you waggle your head."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "To tell you true, I counterfeit him."
    m:
      - "Really, I’m only pretending to be him."

  - sp: URSULA
    o:
      - "You could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very"
      - "man. Here’s his dry hand up and down. You are he, you are"
      - "he."
    m:
      - "You could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself. Look, you’ve got his wrinkled hands. You are Antonio, you are he."

  - sp: ANTONIO
    o:
      - "At a word, I am not."
    m:
      - "In short, I’m not."

  - sp: URSULA
    o:
      - "Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your"
      - "excellent wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum, you are"
      - "he. Graces will appear, and there’s an end."
    m:
      - "Come on, do you think I can’t recognize you by your excellent wit? Can a good thing hide itself? Be quiet, you are Antonio. A man’s virtues will always show themselves, and that’s the end of that."

  - os: "They move aside. BENEDICK andBEATRICE move forward."
    ms: "They move aside. BENEDICK andBEATRICE move forward."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "Will you not tell me who told you so?"
    m:
      - "Won’t you tell me who told you that?"

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:
      - "No, you shall pardon me."
    m:
      - "No, you’ll have to excuse me."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "Nor will you not tell me who you are?"
    m:
      - "And you won’t tell me who you are?"

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:
      - "Not now."
    m:
      - "Not now."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of The"
      - "Hundred Merry Tales! Well this was Signor Benedick that"
      - "said so."
    m:
      - "Who said that I was disdainful, and that I got all my best lines out of a bad joke book?! Well, it must have been Signior Benedick."

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:
      - "What’s he?"
    m:
      - "Who’s that?"

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "I am sure you know him well enough."
    m:
      - "I’m sure you know him."

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:
      - "Not I, believe me."
    m:
      - "No I don’t, believe me."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "Did he never make you laugh?"
    m:
      - "What, he never made you laugh?"

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:
      - "I pray you, what is he?"
    m:
      - "Please tell me, who is this man?"

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "Why, he is the Prince’s jester, a very dull fool, only his gift"
      - "is in devising impossible slanders. None but libertines"
      - "delight in him, and the commendation is not in his wit but"
      - "in his villainy, for he both pleases men and angers them,"
      - "and then they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in"
      - "the fleet. I would he had boarded me."
    m:
      - "Why, he’s the Prince’s fool, and a very dull fool at that. His only talent is his capacity to come up with unbelievable slanders. Only the most immoral people enjoy his company, and they like him not for his wit but his outrageousness. He manages to both please and anger people; they laugh at him and then beat him up. I’m sure he’s out there dancing. I could have sworn he trampled on me."

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:
      - "When I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him what you say."
    m:
      - "When I meet this gentleman, I’ll tell him what you’ve said."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "Do, do. He’ll but break a comparison or two on me, which,"
      - "peradventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into"
      - "melancholy, and then there’s a partridge wing saved, for the"
      - "fool will eat no supper that night."
    m:
      - "Oh, please do. He’ll say a few nasty things about me, and if nobody listens to him or laughs, he’ll be thrown into a funk. And that will save a partridge wing from being eaten, because he’ll be too miserable for dinner."

  - os: "Music for the dance"
    ms: "Music for the dance begins."

  - o:
      - "We must follow the leaders."
    m:
      - "Come on, we have to follow the leaders of the dance."

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:
      - "In every good thing."
    m:
      - "In every good thing they do."

  - sp: BEATRICE
    o:
      - "Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next"
      - "turning."
    m:
      - "No, if they try to lead us to harm, I will leave the dance floor at the next song."

  - os: "Dance, then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, and CLAUDIO"
    ms: "There is a dance. Everyone exits except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, andCLAUDIO."

  - sp: DON JOHN
    o:
      - "*(to BORACHIO)* Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and"
      - "hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it. The"
      - "ladies follow her, and but one visor remains."
    m:
      - "*(to BORACHIO)* My brother just wooed Hero and now has taken her father inside to tell him his feelings. The ladies have followed Hero, but one masked man remains."

  - sp: BORACHIO
    o:
      - "And that is Claudio. I know him by his bearing."
    m:
      - "That’s Claudio. I can tell by the way he carries himself."

  - sp: DON JOHN
    o:
      - "*(to CLAUDIO)* Are not you Signor Benedick?"
    m:
      - "*(to CLAUDIO)* Aren’t you Signior Benedick?"

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "You know me well. I am he."
    m:
      - "You know me too well. I am Benedick."

  - sp: DON JOHN
    o:
      - "Signor, you are very near my brother in his love. He is"
      - "enamored on Hero. I pray you, dissuade him from her. She"
      - "is no equal for his birth. You may do the part of an honest"
      - "man in it."
    m:
      - "Sir, my brother is very fond of you. He is in love with Hero. Please make him change his mind. She doesn’t have the proper rank to marry the Prince. You would be doing a good service."

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "How know you he loves her?"
    m:
      - "How do you know he loves her?"

  - sp: DON JOHN
    o:
      - "I heard him swear his affection."
    m:
      - "I heard him swear he did."

  - sp: BORACHIO
    o:
      - "So did I too, and he swore he would marry her tonight."
    m:
      - "I did too, and he also swore he would marry her tonight."

  - sp: DON JOHN
    o:
      - "Come, let us to the banquet."
    m:
      - "Come on, let’s get to the banquet."

  - os: "Exeunt DON JOHN andBORACHIO"
    ms: "DON JOHN andBORACHIO exit."

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "*(unmasking)*"
      - "Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,"
      - "But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio."
      - "’Tis certain so, the Prince woos for himself."
      - "Friendship is constant in all other things"
      - "Save in the office and affairs of love."
      - "Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues."
      - "Let every eye nogetiate for itself"
      - "And trust no agent, for beauty is a witch"
      - "Against whose charms faith melteth into blood."
      - "This is an accident of hourly proof,"
      - "Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero."
    m:
      - "*(taking off his mask)* Though I said my name was Benedick, I heard this news with Claudio’s ears. Of course the Prince wants Hero for himself. Friendship is enduring except when love is involved. Therefore, all lovers should speak for themselves. They should look for themselves, without asking someone else to get involved in their affairs. Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion. This happens a lot, but it didn’t occur to me that it would happen to me. Goodbye then, Hero."

  - os: "Enter BENEDICK"
    ms: "BENEDICK enters."

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:
      - "Count Claudio?"
    m:
      - "Claudio?"

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "Yea, the same."
    m:
      - "Yes, that’s me."

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:
      - "Come, will you go with me?"
    m:
      - "Will you come with me?"

  - sp: CLAUDIO
    o:
      - "Whither?"
    m:
      - "Where?"

  - sp: BENEDICK
    o:

She speaks daggers, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her words, she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star. I wouldn’t marry her, even if she were as blessed as paradise. If she were married to the great hero Hercules, she would have humiliated him with chores around the house and ordered him to chop up his famous club for firewood. Please, don’t mention her. She’s as wicked as Ate, just disguised in pretty clothes. I wish to God that some wise man would conjure her away, because as long as she lives on earth, our lives are filled with turmoil. It’s quieter in hell, where people, sinning on purpose, are eager to be sent just to get away from her. So chaos, horror, and sorrow follow her wherever she goes."
